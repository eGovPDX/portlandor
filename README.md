# Portland Oregon Drupal 8 Site

## Get the code

`git clone git@github.com:eGovPDX/portlandor.git` will create a folder called `portlandor` whereever you run it and pull down the code from the repo.

## Git setup for our Windows developers

Windows handles line endings differently than \*nix based systems (Unix, Linux, macOS). To make sure our code is interoperable with the Linux servers to which they are deployed and to the local Linux containers where you develop, you will need to make sure your git configuration is set to properly handle line endings.

We want the repo to correctly pull down symlinks for use in the Lando containers.git. To do this, we will enable symlinks as part of the cloning of the repo.

`git clone -c core.symlinks=true git@github.com:eGovPDX/portlandor.git`

`git clone` and `git checkout` must be run as an administrator in order to create symbolic links
(run either Command Prompt or Windows Powershell as administrator for this step)

Run `git config core.autocrlf false` to make sure this repository does not try to convert line endings for your Windows machine.

## Installing Lando

Follow the steps at https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html

## Uninstalling Lando

Follow the steps at https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/uninstalling.html
To completely remove all traces of Lando, follow the "removing lingering Lando configuration" steps

## Using Lando

The .lando.yml file included in this repo will set you up to connect to the correct Pantheon dev environment for the Portland Oregon website. To initialize your local site for the first time, follow the steps below:

1. From within your project root directory, run `lando start` to initialize your containers.
2. Log in to Pantheon and generate a machine token from My Dashboard > Account > Machine Tokens.
3. Run `lando terminus auth:login --machine-token=[YOUR MACHINE TOKEN]`, this logs your Lando instance into our Pantheon account.
4. To make sure you don't hit rate limits with composer, log into Github and generate a personal access token and add it to your lando instance by using `lando composer config --global --auth github-oauth.github.com "$COMPOSER_TOKEN"`. (You should replace \$COMPOSER_TOKEN with your generated token.) There is a handy tutorial for this at https://coderwall.com/p/kz4egw/composer-install-github-rate-limiting-work-around
5. **If this is a new clone of the repo:** before continuing to the next step you must run `lando composer install` and `lando yarn install` to install the appropriate dependencies.
6. You have three options to get your database and files set up:
   1. Run `lando latest` to automaticaly download and import the latest DB from Dev.
   2. Manually import the database
      1. Download the latest database from the Dev environment on Pantheon. (https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/5c6715db-abac-4633-ada8-1c9efe354629#dev/backups/backup-log)
      2. Move your database export into a folder in your project root called `/artifacts`. (We added this to our .gitignore, so the directory won't be there until you create it.)
      3. Run `lando db-import artifacts/portlandor_dev_2018-04-12T00-00-00_UTC_database.sql.gz`. (This is just an example, you'll need to use the actual filename of the database dump you downloaded.)
    3. Download the latest files from the Dev environment on Pantheon. (https://dashboard.pantheon.io/sites/5c6715db-abac-4633-ada8-1c9efe354629#dev/backups/backup-log)
        1. Move your files backup into `web/sites/default/files`
7. Run `lando refresh` to build your local environment to match master. (This runs composer install, drush updb, drush cim, and drush cr.)
8. You should now be able to visit https://portlandor.lndo.site in your browser.
9. To enable XDebug, run `lando xdebug-on`. Run `lando xdebug-off` to turn it off for increased performance.
10. When you are done with your development for the day, run `lando stop` to shut off your development containers or `lando poweroff` if you want to stop all lando containers.

See other Lando with Pantheon commands at https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/pantheon.html.

## Local development mode

By default the site runs in "development" mode locally, which means that caching is off and twig debugging is on, etc. These settings are managed in web/sites/default/local.services.yml. While it is possible to update these settings if the developer wishes to run the site with caching on and twig debug off, updates to this file should never be comitted in the repo, so that developers are always working in dev mode by default.

## Workflow for this repository

We are using a modified version of GitHub Flow to keep things simple. While you don't need to fork the repo if you are on the eGov dev team, you will need to issue pull requests from a feature branch in order to get your code into `master`. Master is a protected branch.

To best work with Pantheon Multidev, we are going to keep feature branch names simple and use the master branch as our integration point that builds to the Pantheon Dev environment.

### Start new work in your local environment

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
lando latest
lando refresh
# Next run `git checkout -b powr-[ID]`
```

<details>

1. Verify you are on the master branch with `git checkout master`.
2. On the master branch, run `git pull origin master`. This will make sure you have the latest changes from the remote master. Optionally, running `git pull -p origin` will prune any local branches not on the remote to help keep your local repo clean.
3. Use the issue ID from Jira for a new feature branch name to start work: `git checkout -b powr-[ID]` to create and checkout a new branch. (We use lowercase for the branch name to help create Pantheon multidev environments correctly.) If the branch already exists, you may use `git checkout powr-[ID]` to switch to your branch.
4. Run `lando latest` at the start of every sprint to update your local database with a copy of the database from Dev.
5. Run `lando refresh` to refresh your local environment to match master. (This runs composer install, drush updb, drush cim, and drush cr.)
6. You are now ready to develop on your feature branch.

</details>

### Commit code and push to Github

1. In addition to any custom modules or theming files you may have created, you need to export any configuraiton changes to the repo in order for those changes to be synchronized. Run `lando drush cex` (config-export) in your local envionrment to create/update/delete the necessary config files. You will need to commit these to git.
2. To commit your work, run `git add -A` to add all of the changes to your local repo. (If you prefer to be a little more precise, you can `git add [filename]` for each file or several files separated by a space.
3. Then create a commit with a comment, such as `git commit -m "POWR-[ID] description of your change."`
4. Just before you push to GitHub, you should rebase your feature branch on the latest in the remote master. To do this run `git fetch origin master` then `git rebase -i origin/master`. This lets you "interatively" replay your change on the tip of a current master branch. You'll need to pick, squash or drop your changes and resolve any conflicts to get a clean commit that can be pushed to master. You may need to `git rebase --continue` until all of your changes have been replayed and your branch is clean.
5. Run `lando refresh` to refresh your local environment with any changes from master. (This runs composer install, drush updb, drush cim, and drush cr.)
6. You can now run `git push -u origin powr-[ID]`. This will push your feature branch and set its remote to a branch of the same name on origin (GitHub).

### Create a pull request

When your work is ready for code review and merge:

- Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub for your working branch.
- Make sure to include POWR-[ID] and a short description of the feature in your PR title so that Jira can relate that PR to the correct issue.

### Continuous integration on CircleCI

1. The PR creation triggers an automated CircleCI build, deployment, and test process that will:
   - Check out code from your working branch on GitHub.
   - Run `composer install`.
   - Deploy the site to a multidev feature branch site on Pantheon.
   - Run `drush cim` to import config changes.
   - Run `drush updb` to update the database.
   - Run `drush cr` to rebuild the caches.
   - Run smoke tests against the feature branch site to make sure the build was successful.
2. If the build fails, you can go back to your local project and correct any issues and repeat the process of getting a clean commit pushed to GitHub. Once a PR exists, every commit to that branch will trigger a new CircleCI build. You only need to run `git push` from your branch if it is already connected to the remote, but you'll probably want to step through the rebase steps if the time between pushes is anything less than a couple of minutes.

3. The CI job `visual-regression` runs tests under different users in parallel and `finalize-all` notifies Percy that all tests have finished. Functional tests are performed directly on CI servers while screenshots are sent to Percy for post processing. When a functional test fails, click on the `Details` link next to the job `ci/circleci: visual_regression` to review CI log for error messages. When a screenshot comparision test fails, click on the `Details` link next to the `percy/portlandor` job to review and approve the result if the visual difference is only caused by content updates. If the visual difference is **not** caused by content updates, a comment should be added to the JIRA ticket with a link to the screenshot in question.

### Pantheon MultiDev site

1. You'll need to prep anything on the multidev site that is needed for QA to complete the test plan. This is also a chance to see if you need to address any issues with an additional commit.
2. In Jira, update the test plan of your issue including the URL to the feature branch. Move the issue to "QA" and assign the issue to the QA team.

### QA

1. Executes the test plan step by step. (As Rick likes to say, "try and break it! Be creative!")
2. If defects are found, communicate with the developer and move the issue back to "Todo" in Jira and assign it back to the developer. Document what you find as comments on the issue and decide with the developer if you need to open bugs to address in the future or if you should address the issue now.
3. If no defect is found, move the issue to "Merge and Accept" in Jira and assign it to the build master.

### Move to Merge and Accept

Go back to your PR in GitHub and make sure to assign at least one team member as a reviewer. Reviews are required before the code can be merged. We are mostly checking to make sure the merge is going to be clean, but if we are adding custom code, it is nice to have a second set of eyes checking for our coding standards.

## Build master

There are a few extra steps for the assigned build master. This person is the final sanity check before merging in changes to the Dev, Test and Live instances on Pantheon. Basically the Dev and Test deploys are an opportunity to practice and test the deployment of the feature.

### Merge on Github and deploy to Pantheon Dev site

1. After a team member has provided an approval, which may be after responding to feedback and resolving review issues, the build master will be able to push the "Merge" button and commit the work to the master. Make sure the merge message is prepended with the Jira issue ID (e.g. "POWR-42 Adding the super duper feature")
   - The merge triggers an automated CircleCI build, deployment, and test process on the Dev environment similar to the multidev deployment.
2. Test that everything still works Dev. This is just a sanity check since a QA has already been performed.
   - Can you confirm the expected code changes were deployed?
   - Do permissions need to be rebuilt?
3. If all work from the issue is merged and the issue has been moved to the done column on our Jira board, you may delete the feature branch from Github.

### Releases to Test (or Production)

We are using the Dev environment to integrate all the approved code from master and make sure things are solid. At least once per week, or more frequently as needed, our combined changes should be pushed to the Test environment. This deployment essentially tells us if our code will be safe on Production.

1. Go to the Pantheon dashboard and navigate to the Test environment.
2. Under Deploys, you should see that the code you just deployed to Dev is ready for Test. Merge that code and run the build on Test. You should make sure and provide a handy release message that tells us a little about what is included. As we get more mature with this process, we'll include instructions for naming the release.
3. Go to the Test website and synchronize the configuration at /admin/config/development/configuration or run `lando terminus drush portlandor.test cim -y`.
4. Verify that everything still works on Test.

Once a deployment to Test has been tested and passes, the same set of changes should be deployed to Production by following the same basic procedure above.

## Theme

Note: The theme build process is automatically triggered everytime your Lando containers start up and whenever you run `lando refresh` so you should only need to manually run it if you're editing the .scss or .js source files.

### Quick Start

1. Run `lando yarn start`
2. Go to `https://portlandor.lndo.site/pattern-lab`

Here are some additional commands you may find useful.

- Run `lando yarn run build` to build both the theme assets and Pattern Lab.
- Run `lando yarn run watch` to build both the thme assets and  Pattern Lab, watch for changes and trigger rebuilds for both.

### Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab is tool used to document the design choices and `.twig` templates that make up the Cloudy theme.

To get started with Pattern Lab,

Here are some useful commands when working with Pattern Lab:

- Run `lando yarn run build:pl` to build the Pattern Lab site.
- Run `lando yarn run watch:pl` to build the Pattern Lab site, watch for changes and trigger rebuilds.
- Run `lando yarn run clean:pl` to delete the Pattern Lab site.

#### *Note*

There is a known issue with PL v3 builds erroneously reporting missing template files if they exist outside of the `pattern-lab` directory. However, these are false positives. Pattern Lab is finding the file and rendering the pattern.

For more information, see: [Pattern Lab Github Issue #1116](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues/1116)

### Cloudy's asset files

Note: Make modifications to the desired SCSS and JavaScript files in the theme. Never modify `style.bundle.css`, `main.bundle.js`, or anything in the `dist` direction directly. We build `style.bundle.css` as part of our CI, you should run the development or build script locally to compile your scss files into style.bundle.css.

You have a couple of options for manually compiling the asset files:

- Run `lando yarn run build:wp` to build the Pattern Lab site.
- Run `lando yarn run watch:wp` to build the Pattern Lab site, watch for changes and trigger rebuilds.
- Run `lando yarn run clean:wp` to delete the Pattern Lab site.

You can run `lando yarn install` if you need to install/update your Node dependencies.

### Webpack output

The following is a snippet of Webpack build output from a successful build:

```

        + 1 hidden module
```

The output lists some version information, followed by output information, and then debugging information for the path travelled by the webpack configuration. It's helpful to compare this output to the configuration file to understand the output. For this project we use an entrypoint to bundle our javascript and Sass files in the same entrypoint, main in this case. One important note for Javascript compiling is that we are relying on Drupal providing the jQuery window variable so we don't have a conflict where two instances exist. Our library depends on the core/jquery library so it should always be available.

The CSS output from compiling our Sass files is then bundled together using the mini-css-extract-plugin. To complete that process, the Sass file is copiled, then run through PostCSS, then finally, the CSS is loaded and extracted.

Often the last few lines are the most important, and tell you where the error is found. Here, we can see that we had a bad import statement trying to import a non-existent file in \_components.scss.

## Using Composer

Composer is built into our Lando implementation for package management. We use it primarily to manage Drupal contrib modules and libraries.

Here is a good guide to using Composer with Drupal 8: https://www.lullabot.com/articles/drupal-8-composer-best-practices

Composer cheat sheet: https://devhints.io/composer

### Installing contrib modules

Use `lando composer require drupal/[module name]` to download contrib modules and add them to the composer.json file. This ensures they're installed in each environment where the site is built. Drupal modules that are added this way must also be enabled using the `lando drush pm:enable [module name]` command.

### Updating contrib modules and lock file

In general it's a good practice to keep dependencies updated to latest versions, but that introduces the risk of new bugs from upstream dependencies. Updating all dependencies should be done judiciously, and usually only at the beginning of a sprint, when there's adequate time to regression test and resolve issues. Individual packages can be updated as needed, without as much risk to the project.

To update all dependencies, run `lando composer update`. To update a specific package, for example the Devel module, run `lando composer update --with-dependencies drupal/devel`. After updating, make sure to commit the updated composer.lock file.

The composer.lock file contains a commit hash that identifies the exact commit version of the lock file and all dependencies' dependencies. You can think of it as a tag for the exact combination of dependencies being committed, and it's used to determine whether composer.lock is out of date.

When something changes in composer.json, but the lock hash has not been updated, you may receive the warning:
...
The lock file is not up to date with the latest changes in composer.json. You may be getting outdated dependencies. Run update to update them.
...

To resolve this, run `lando composer update --lock`, which will generate a new hash. If you encounter a conflict on the hash value when you merge or rebase, use the most recent (yours) version of the hash.
