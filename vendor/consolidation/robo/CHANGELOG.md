#### 1.0.0 10/10/2016

* [Collection] Add tasks to a collection, and implement them as a group with rollback
   * Tasks may be added to a collection via `$collection->add($task);`
   * `$collection->run();` runs all tasks in the collection
   * `$collection->addCode(function () { ... } );` to add arbitrary code to a collection
   * `$collection->progressMessage(...);` will log a message
   * `$collection->rollback($task);` and `$collection->rollbackCode($callable);` add a rollback function to clean up after a failed task
   * `$collection->completion($task);` and `$collection->completionCode($callable);` add a function that is called once the collection completes or rolls back.
   * `$collection->before();` and `$collection->after();` can be used to add a task or function that runs before or after (respectively) the specified named task. To use this feature, tasks must be given names via an optional `$taskName` parameter when they are added.
   * Collections may be added to collections, if desired. 
* [CollectionBuilder] Create tasks and add them to a collection in a single operation.
   * `$this->collectionBuilder()->taskExec('pwd')->taskExec('ls')->run()`
* Add output formatters
   * If a Robo command returns a string, or a `Result` object with a `$message`, then it will be printed
   * Commands may be annotated to describe output formats that may be used
   * Structured arrays returned from function results may be converted into different formats, such as a table, yml, json, etc.
   * Tasks must `use TaskIO` for output methods. It is no longer possible to `use IO` from a task. For direct access use `Robo::output()` (not recommended).   
* Use league/container to do Dependency Injection
   * *Breaking* Tasks' loadTasks traits must use `$this->task(TaskClass::class);` instead of `new TaskClass();`
   * *Breaking* Tasks that use other tasks must use `$this->collectionBuilder()->taskName();` instead of `new TaskClass();` when creating task objects to call. Implement `Robo\Contract\BuilderAwareInterface` and use `Robo\Contract\BuilderAwareTrait` to add the `collectionBuilder()` method to your task class.
* *Breaking* The `arg()`, `args()` and `option()` methods in CommandArguments now escape the values passed in to them. There is now a `rawArg()` method if you need to add just one argument that has already been escaped.
* *Breaking* taskWrite is now called taskWriteToFile
* [Extract] task added
* [Pack] task added
* [TmpDir], [WorkDir] and [TmpFile] tasks added
* Support Robo scripts that allows scripts starting with `#!/usr/bin/env robo` to define multiple robo commands.  Use `#!/usr/bin/env robo run` to define a single robo command implemented by the `run()` method.
* Provide ProgresIndicatorAwareInterface and ProgressIndicatorAwareTrait that make it easy to add progress indicators to tasks
* Add --simulate mode that causes tasks to print what they would have done, but make no changes
* Add `robo generate:task` code-generator to make new stack-based task wrappers around existing classes
* Add `robo sniff` by @dustinleblanc. Runs the PHP code sniffer followed by the code beautifier, if needed.
* Implement ArrayInterface for Result class, so result data may be accessed like an array 
* Defer execution of operations in taskWriteToFile until the run() method
* Add Write::textIfMatch() for taskWriteToFile
* ResourceExistenceChecker used for error checking in DeleteDir, CopyDir, CleanDir and Concat tasks by @burzum
* Provide ResultData base class for Result; ResultData may be used in instances where a specific `$task` instance is not available (e.g. in a Robo command)
* ArgvInput now available via $this->getInput() in RoboFile by Thomas Spigel
* Add optional message to git tag task by Tim Tegeler
* Rename 'FileSystem' to 'Filesystem' wherever it occurs.
* Current directory is changed with `chdir` only if specified via the `--load-from` option (RC2)

#### 0.6.0 10/30/2015

* Added `--load-from` option to make Robo start RoboFiles from other directories. Use it like `robo --load-from /path/to/where/RobFile/located`.
* Robo will not ask to create RoboFile if it does not exist, `init` command should be used.
* [ImageMinify] task added by @gabor-udvari
* [OpenBrowser] task added by @oscarotero
* [FlattenDir] task added by @gabor-udvari
* Robo Runner can easily extended for custom runner by passing RoboClass and RoboFile parameters to constructor. By @rdeutz See #232

#### 0.5.4 08/31/2015

* [WriteToFile] Fixed by @gabor-udvari: always writing to file regardless whether any changes were made or not. This can bring the taskrunner into an inifinite loop if a replaced file is being watched.
