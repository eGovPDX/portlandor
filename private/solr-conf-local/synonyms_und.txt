# Contains synonyms to use for your index. For the format used, see

# (Lines starting with a pound character # are ignored.)
#
# There are two ways to specify synonym mappings:
#    1. A comma-separated list of words. If the token matches any of the words, then all the words 
#       in the list are substituted, which will include the original token.
#    2. Two comma-separated lists of words with the symbol "=>" between them. If the token matches 
#       any word on the left, then the list on the right is substituted. The original token will 
#       not be included unless it is also in the list on the right.
