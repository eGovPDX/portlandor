Feature: Site is running
  In order to test that the site is up
  As an anonymous user
  I need to be able to see the homepage

  Scenario: Visit the homepage
    Given I am an anonymous user
    When I visit "/"
    Then I should see "Portland, Oregon" in the "footer_second" region
    And I should see the link "Services" in the "primary_menu" region
