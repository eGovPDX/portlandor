# Data Tables

- Use tables to display data, never as a means of page layout.
- Use Base table template by default.
- Use Small table template for large amounts of data.
- Column and row table headers are required for accessibility.
- The table header tag `th` identifies cells that are either row or column headers. Include `scope="col"` for column table headers and `scope="row"` for row table headers.
- Use the caption tag to summarize the content displayed in the table, e.g., “Nutritional values in grain-based breakfast foods.”

## Variations
- Base
- Small (compact)
