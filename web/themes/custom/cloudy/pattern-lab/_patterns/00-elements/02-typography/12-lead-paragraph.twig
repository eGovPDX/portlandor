<p class="cloudy-lead-text">A "lead" paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos odigo) is the first prominent self-contained unit of a discourse at the top of a website's content section. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
