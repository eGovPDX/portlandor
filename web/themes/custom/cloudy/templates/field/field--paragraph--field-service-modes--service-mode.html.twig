/**
 * @file
 * Theme override for the service mode type field (i.e. Online, Email, etc.).
 * This is the value that's displayed in the tab labels on a service page.
 * We are manually displaying the value in field--field-service-mode.html.twig,
 * so we don't want it redisplayed in the default field.html.twig template.
 * Basically, the only purpose of this override template is to prevent the default
 * display of the field value. (Is there a better way to do this? We need the
 * value to remain in the content array so that it can be used elsewhere.)
 *
 * This is an override of field.html.twig for the service mode field. See that
 * template for documentation about its details and overrides.
 *
 * @see field.html.twig
