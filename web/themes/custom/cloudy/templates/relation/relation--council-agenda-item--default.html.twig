{#
/**
 * @file
 * Theme override to display a relation.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - relation: The relation entity with limited access to object properties and methods.
 *   Only method names starting with "get", "has", or "is" and a few common
 *   methods such as "id", "label", and "bundle" are available. For example:
 *   - relation.getCreatedTime() will return the relation creation timestamp.
 *   - relation.hasField('field_example') returns TRUE if the relation bundle includes
 *     field_example. (This does not indicate the presence of a value in this
 *     field.)
 *   - relation.isPublished() will return whether the relation is published or not.
 *   Calling other methods, such as relation.delete(), will result in an exception.
 *   See \Drupal\relation\Entity\Node for a full list of public properties and
 *   methods for the relation object.
 * - label: (optional) The title of the relation.
 * - content: All relation items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') }} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - date: (optional) Themed creation date field.
 * - author_name: (optional) Themed author name field.
 * - url: Direct URL of the current relation.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - relation: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - relation--type-[type]: The current relation type. For example, if the relation is an
 *     "Article" it would result in "relation--type-article". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - relation--view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the relation; for example, a
 *     teaser would result in: "relation--view-mode-teaser", and
 *     full: "relation--view-mode-full".
 *   The following are controlled through the relation  options.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   relation cannot hold the main body content.
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_relation()
 *
 * @todo Remove the id attribute (or make it a class), because if that gets
 *   rendered twice on a page this is invalid CSS for example: two lists
 *   in different view modes.
