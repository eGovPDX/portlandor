## Main Navigation Example
<br>
This is an example of a responsive main navigation, including small and large screen variations with a number of recommended best practices for user experience.

For Drupal usage, you should follow the Drupal.behaviors commenting/uncommenting instructions in `main-menu.js` as well as set up Pattern Lab to recognize the Drupal behaviors object (see comments in `components/_meta/_01-foot.twig`).
