        <p>RE: Resolution to your Towing Complaint&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Dear COMPLAINANT,&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We have concluded our investigation into your complaint against TOWER regarding tow &lt;placeholder_TOW NUMBER&gt;.</p>

        <p>On DATE, I directed &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt; to issue you a full refund for your towing costs.&nbsp; This was based on my finding that &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt; violated &lt;placeholder_City Code/Administrative Rule/Contract&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>I determined that &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt; violated &lt;placeholder_City Code/Administrative Rule/Contract&gt; by &lt;placeholder_WHAT THEY DID&gt;.&nbsp; As a result, I directed &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt; to issue a full refund to you of the towing fees you paid them for this tow. &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt; chose to appeal my decision to the Code Hearings Office.&nbsp; The Code Hearings Office ruled in favor of &lt;placeholder_TOW COMPANY&gt;. As a result, there will be no refund of your towing fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>This determination is in no way intended to prevent any person from pursuing remedy in civil court.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

        <p>RE: Determination for Complaint on Tow&nbsp;&lt;placeholder_TOW NUMBER&gt;</p>

        <p>Dear &lt;placeholder_ADDRESSEE&gt;,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Thank you for responding to the complaint regarding tow &lt;placeholder_TOW NUMBER&gt;. The vehicle that is the subject of this letter was a &lt;placeholder_VEH MAKE AND MODEL&gt; with &lt;placeholder_LICENSE PLATE&gt; that was towed from &lt;placeholder_TOW LOCATION&gt;&nbsp;at &lt;placeholder_TOW ADDRESS&gt; on &lt;placeholder_TOW DATE&gt;. We received the complaint on &lt;placeholder_COMPLAINT DATE&gt; and notified you of the complaint on &lt;placeholder_NOTIFICATION DATE&gt;.</p>

        <p>This purpose of this letter is to inform you of our determination regarding this complaint.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>I. FACTS&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <ul>
        	<li>
        	<p>According to the notes in the tow record provided by Retriever Towing, the tow company was contacted by someone who observed the driver of the towed vehicle parking and leaving the premises. There was no mention of a verbal warning to the driver of the towed vehicle to inform them they were illegally parked or that their vehicle would be towed.&nbsp;</p>
        	</li>
        	<li>
        	<p>The signs on the property at the time of the tow did not indicate that the lot had an on-site monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        	</li>
        	<li>
        	<p>On the tow slip, the tow driver indicated the reason for the tow being “Non-Customer.”&nbsp;</p>
        	</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        	<li>
        	<p>No written authorization from an authorized tow requestor listed on the Private Property Impound Agreement was found regarding this vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
        	</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>II. RULES&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p><u>Administrative Rule 9.05-13 Prohibitions&nbsp;</u></p>

        <ul>
        	<li>3. Predatory practices&nbsp;
        	<ul>
        		<li>A.  It is unlawful for a PPI tower to park within 1,000 feet of, or post a monitor at, a private parking facility for the purpose of covert observation in order to obtain PPI tows, unless:&nbsp;
        		<ul>
        			<li>1.  The monitor provides a verbal warning to persons leaving their cars; or,&nbsp;</li>
        			<li>2.  All signs clearly warn that the lot has on-site monitoring and the hours during which monitoring occurs.&nbsp;</li>
        		</ul>
        		</li>
        		<li>B.  Failure to provide any of these notices will invalidate the tow and may result in refund to the complainant and/or civil penalties.&nbsp;</li>
        	</ul>
        	</li>
        </ul>

        <p><u>Portland City Code (PCC) 7.24.050 Towing Regulations&nbsp;</u></p>

        <p>Except for towing allowed under ORS 98.854(3), a PPI Tower may lawfully tow a vehicle without the registered owner’s permission from private property in the City of Portland only if:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
        	<li>
        	<p>The PPI tower has express written authorization from the private parking facility owner, or person in lawful possession of the property, in compliance with Chapters 98.812, 98.830 and 98.854 of the Oregon Revised Statutes;&nbsp;</p>
        	</li>
        </ol>

        <p><u>Oregon Revised Statute (ORS) 98.854&nbsp;</u></p>

        <ul>
        	<li>(2) Except as provided in ORS <a href="https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/98.853">98.853 (Conditions allowing towing)</a>, tow a motor vehicle from a parking facility without first contacting the owner of the parking facility or the owner’s agent at the time of the tow and receiving signed authorization from the owner of the parking facility or the owner’s agent that the tower should tow the motor vehicle. The tower shall maintain for at least two years, in electronic or printed form, each signed authorization received under this subsection. Upon request, the tower shall provide a copy of the signed authorization to the owner or operator of the motor vehicle at no additional charge.&nbsp;</li>
        	<li>(3) Serve as an agent of an owner of a parking facility for the purpose of signing an authorization required by subsection (2) of this section.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p><u>PCC 7.24.090 Remedies&nbsp;</u></p>

        <ul>
        	<li>E.  Refund to vehicle owner/owner's agent.  Upon a finding of any violation by a PPI tower, the Director may direct release of a vehicle at no charge or a refund of all or part of fees paid by a vehicle owner/owner's agent for towing and storage, in lieu of, or in addition to, civil penalties.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>III. DETERMINATION&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>After careful review of the information provided by Retriever Towing and the vehicle owner, it is my determination that the vehicle was towed in violation of PCC 7.24.050A, ORS 98.854, and AR LIC 9.05-13 (3).&nbsp; Per the notes in the tow record, someone was observing the motorist but the record doesn’t reflect any attempt to inform the driver that the vehicle was parked illegally and could be towed. Further, Retriever Towing didn’t receive written authorization from an authorized tow requester to tow the vehicle. This is in direct violation of AR LIC 9.05-13 (3), Predatory Practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Consequently, I am directing Retriever Towing to refund the vehicle owner, John Doe, their towing expenses in the amount of $309.50.&nbsp; Refund is due by January 25, 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p><strong>In addition, I am issuing a civil penalty in the amount of $200.00 for violation of AR 9.05-13 (3) Predatory Practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p><strong>IV. APPEAL RIGHTS&nbsp;</strong></p>

        <p>This decision is appealable to the City of Portland Hearings Office. If you believe that this determination is not consistent with City Code, you may request an appeal before a Code Hearings Officer under the provisions of Portland City Code Chapter 22.10. To arrange a hearing, you must submit and appeal hearing request online <strong>no later than 10 business days after the date of this determination</strong>. Your request must include a description of what you believe makes this determination invalid along with copies of any evidence you wish to submit. You may file your appeal at the address below: City of Portland Code Hearings Office https://www.portland.gov/omf/hearings Phone 503-823-7307 Fax 503-823-4347 You will receive an acknowledgement from the Code Hearings Office if you submit an appeal request. Please note that if you request an appeal, the decision in this letter may be stayed until the Hearings Officer makes a final determination.&nbsp;</p>
