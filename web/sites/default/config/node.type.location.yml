help: 'Locations are named addresses or geographic information that can be reused by any editor for their content. If your location has <strong>hours of operation open to the public</strong>, it should be created as a <strong><a href="/node/add/service_location">service location</a></strong> after creating the <strong>building</strong> that contains that service location. Please ensure the location you are creating does not already exist by checking the <strong><a href="/locations/manage">locations list</a></strong>. All new locations will be <strong>reviewed by Portland.gov Website Support</strong> to ensure proper formatting and to check for duplicates.'
