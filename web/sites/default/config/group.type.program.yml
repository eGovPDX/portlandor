description: 'A program is a long term site for sharing guides, information, news, and/or events with the community. A program does not require direct interaction from the community. If your site is for a project that has a set beginning and end date, consider using a project instead. A program may have one or more associated locations and services. All programs are run by one or more bureaus or offices and may be partially funded by public-private partnerships, other governmental organizations, or federal and state grants.'
