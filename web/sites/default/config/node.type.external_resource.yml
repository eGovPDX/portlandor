description: 'A resource is content or an application not hosted on Portland.gov or that cannot be indexed on Portland.gov such as a search view . Resources can be used for state, county, and metro-area services to create a search result with a summary. Resources can also be used to create a link that can be featured that points to a search. (e.g. Find a Park is a resource because the page at /parks/search is not available to our search index or to be featured.)'
