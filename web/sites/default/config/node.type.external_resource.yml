description: 'Services (content that a user can take an action to complete such as apply or pay) and resources (links to content outside of Portland.gov) can be added to the services directory. The services directory is both a <a href="/services">searchable list</a> and a set of actions on the homepage that provide a browsing experience to drill down into specific service types. The eGov and 311 customer service teams classify all content that should appear in the services directory to prevent duplication and misclassification.'
