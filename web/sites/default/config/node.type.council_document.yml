description: 'Council documents are resolutions, ordinances, reports, presentations, and proclamations presented to or by the city council.'
help: "<strong>Council documents</strong> are created with a URL that matches the pattern /council/documents/[type]/[status]/[short title or document number]. Type is one of communication, report, resolution, ordinance, or proclamation. Status is the final disposition status of a document and is not set until the document has been adopted, passed, received, or referred as an agenda item. The short title need not match the full legal title of the document being considered as it will be replaced by the council document number as part of disposition and creation of the final URL address (path).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://employees.portland.gov/council-authors\" target=\"_blank\">Read the council document manual on Portland Employees.</a>"
