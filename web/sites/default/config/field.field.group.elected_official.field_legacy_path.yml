description: 'This field is used to create redirects to this page from legacy pages in the old site. Multiple paths may be entered in case several pages have been combined during migration. Once these paths are created, they may only be modified or removed by an administrator. Paths must be relative and start with a slash. For example, the page "https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bts/39479" should be entered as "/bts/39479."'
