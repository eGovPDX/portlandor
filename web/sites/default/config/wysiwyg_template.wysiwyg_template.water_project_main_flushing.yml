  value: "<p>The Portland Water Bureau is conducting unidirectional flushing of water mains in the&nbsp;<strong>[Impacted Neighborhood]</strong>&nbsp;neighborhood during&nbsp;<strong>[Season]</strong>&nbsp;of<strong>[Year]</strong>. Unidirectional flushing is routine maintenance to clean the network of pipes and improve water quality. Flushing usually occurs Monday through Friday, between 8:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Portland Water Bureau is flushing the water mains in the&nbsp;<strong>[Flushing Neighborhood or Intersection]</strong>&nbsp;area on&nbsp;<strong>[Flushing Date]</strong>. Portland Water Bureau crews open fire hydrants to flush water out of the system and bring fresh water into the pipes to improve water quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Residents in the immediate vicinity of flushing may notice temporarily discolored water and lower than normal water pressure. The discoloration does not pose a health risk. However, limit water use and avoid using hot water or running the washing machine or dishwasher until flushing is complete. If you experience some discoloration in your water from nearby flushing, run the water at one tap for 5 minutes to see if it clears. If it does not clear wait an hour and try again. When the water runs clear, flush any taps where discolored water was present.</p>\r\n"
