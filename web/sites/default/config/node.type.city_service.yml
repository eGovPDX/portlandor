description: 'The community must complete one or more steps with a city service usually ending in the action of filling out a form (online or in person), sending an email, calling a phone number, or visiting a location. A city service does not have news or events associated with it though it can belong to a program that does. We may added external services that the community might want to find on the city website in a future version.'
