description: "Any adjustments to budget appropriations or requests for contingency should be handled during the Budget Monitoring Process (BMP) unless there are extenuating circumstances. If you need to make a change outside of the BMP, please contact your CBO analyst at least 3 weeks in advance to ensure that the Council action includes the appropriate budget law format, public noticing, and accounting requirements. If you have questions about whether the item amends the budget, please contact your CBO analyst for guidance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor any grant-related adjustments, please contact the Grants Management Division as soon as you receive a notice of award for guidance on the timing and requirements for Council action."
