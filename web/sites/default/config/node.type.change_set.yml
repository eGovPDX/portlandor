description: 'A change set is used to show how code, charter, and policy is changed over time. Typically, a change set will group a passed ordinance or adopted resolution (council documents) with specific code (title, chapter, section) or charter (chapter, article, section) and the date or triggers for that change to become effective. Change sets appear in the side region of code, charter, and policies as well as in the side region of a council document to make finding the relationships easy.'
