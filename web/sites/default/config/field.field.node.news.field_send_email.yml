Group admins can also configure the group to use a custom GovDelivery newsletter for certain news and event types. The email will include the title, summary, and a link to this item. Emails will only be sent once when content is initially published and will be delivered to users based on their subscription preferences (either immediately or in a combined daily or weekly digest)."
