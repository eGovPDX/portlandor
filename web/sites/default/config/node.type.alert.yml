description: 'Sitewide alerts help inform the community in the event of an emergency, such as inclement weather or water boil notices, and should appear prominently in a banner across the top of all sites until such time as the alerts are unpublished via manual or scheduled interaction. An alert can also be used to convey important information that all site users need to read. A community member may dismiss an alert.'
