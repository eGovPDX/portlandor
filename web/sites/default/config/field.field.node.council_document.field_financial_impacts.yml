If so, please describe any changes to appropriations in addition to including the necessary budget data for an FMBB transaction in the Budgetary Impact Worksheet.

How much staff time will this legislation require (even if covered by an existing position)?</li>\r\n<li>Financial agreements – does the legislation result in a new or modified financial obligation or benefit, including IAs, IGAs, MOUs, grants, contracts or contract amendments.</li>\r\n<li>For items like long-term planning documents that include a number of actions, projects, or commitments, please provide high-level ranges or estimates for the fiscal impact of implementing the plan.
