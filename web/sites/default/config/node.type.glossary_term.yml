description: 'Glossary terms are used to define words, phrases or concepts that may not be known to community members. Once they are defined, text in page content can be highlighted and "tagged" with definitions, which results in popup tooltip definition boxes that include links to more information on the topic. They are intended to be managed as group content but linkable by any editor in any group. Different groups may define terms differently, so managing terms in groups allows a single term to have multiple contexts.'
