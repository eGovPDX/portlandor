Types of reviews include planning and zoning, structural, and fire. Reviewers check to see that your proposal is in compliance with the specific code or regulation. If the proposal is in compliance, the reviewer will sign off and the proposal will move to the next review group. If the reviewer needs additional information or has identified corrections to the proposal, they will request this information from you in writing in the form of a <strong>check sheet</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/bds/types-plan-reviews\">Types of plan review groups\L</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/bds/tracking-your-permit-status\">Tracking your building permit application\L</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/bds/how-respond-permit-check-sheet\">How to respond to a permit check sheet</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You may need to revise your plans in response to a check sheet created by a review group.

You will be notified that your permit is ready, and of your final fee total. You may pick up your permit from the Development Services Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Inspections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you pick up your permit, you will receive an orange (residential) or yellow (commercial) inspection card listing all of the inspections you will need during construction.
