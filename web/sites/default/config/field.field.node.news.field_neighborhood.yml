description: 'Neighborhoods are organized by the six recognized city sections. If you select a neighborhood, the content will automatically appear on its parent city section page. If you select a neighborhood that is nested within other neighborhoods (i.e. Alberta Arts District), the content will appear on both the parent neighborhood pages and the city section pages. Please select the most specific option for your content. You may select as many neighborhoods that apply to the content.'
