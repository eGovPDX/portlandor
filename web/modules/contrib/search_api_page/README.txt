Search API Pages (Drupal 8 Port)
---------------------------------

This module allows you to create simple search pages and search blocks for
searching in your Search API indexes, similar to the core Search functionality.

Installation
------------

As the only pre-requisite you will need the Search API [1] module enabled and
correctly set up, along with at least one service class. Create a server and an
index (or use the default one) and configure them according to your needs.


Configuration
-------------

To add and configure a Search API page, go to admin/config/search/search-api-pages
and add a new page.
