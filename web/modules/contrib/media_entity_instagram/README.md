## About Media entity Instagram

This module provides Instagram integration for Media (i.e. media type provider
plugin).

### Instagram API
This module uses Instagrams oembed API to fetch the instagram html and all the
metadata.

After enabling the module, you can create a new Media Type choosing "Instagram"
on the provider dropdown.

A source field will be automatically created and configured on the Media Type if
this is the first Instagram type on the site. If you need to have additional
types, you can choose to reuse an existing field as source, or create one field
per type. Source fields for the Instagram Media Type need to be plain text or
link fields.

Please refer to the Media documentation for more instructions on how to work
with Media Types.
