## About DropzoneJS

This is the Drupal 8 integration for [DropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com/).

###How to install:
1. Download this module
2. [Download DropzoneJS](https://github.com/enyo/dropzone) and place it in the
   libraries folder
3. Install dropzonejs the [usual way](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8)
4. Remove "test" folder from libraries folder as it could constitute a
   security risk to your site. See http://drupal.org/node/1189632 for more info.

You will now have a dropzonejs element at your disposal.

###Future plans:
- A dropzonejs field widget.
- Handling already uploaded files.
- Handling other types of upload validations (min/max resolution, min size,...)
- Removing files that were removed by the user on first upload from temp storage.
