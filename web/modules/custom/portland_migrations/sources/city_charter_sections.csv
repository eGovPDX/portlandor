The procedures shall provide that an owner of any property within the proposed assessment district or such owner's agent who files proof of his or her authority, may file with the Auditor a written remonstrance against the proposed sewer or the plans therefor, and the Council, upon hearing the remonstrance, may discontinue proceedings in the matter. The period for filing of written objections or remonstrances shall be set by ordinance but shall not exceed sixty days from the date notice is mailed.

The rate of interest thereon shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted under State law, and their maturity shall not exceed twenty (20) years.</p>
<p>Money from the sale of the bonds, after paying from the proceeds the costs of advertising and sale, shall be deposited in a special fund known as the ""Assessment Collection Fund,"" which may be used under Council direction for purchasing property by and in the name of the City at Treasurer's sale or other sale for City assessments, and at foreclosure sales for delinquent taxes, to protect the interest and rights of the City in the property. Net proceeds from the sale of property purchased from the Assessment Collection Fund shall be credited to that fund.</p>
<p>In selling property purchased from the Assessment Collection Fund, or Treasurer's certificates thereon, no transfer of certificate of sale or deed to the City shall be held void or insufficient because of any omission, error, defect or objection, jurisdictional or otherwise, in the assessment or other proceedings if, at some stage of the proceedings before assessment was made, notice was given, and if the description of the property in the certificate or deed is reasonably sufficient to identify it. This provision is intended to be curative as fully as the people may enact, as to all matters affecting the validity of the certificate or deed. Every certificate of sale or deed shall be presumptive evidence of the regularity and sufficiency of all things affecting its validity. In any case where this curative provision is found insufficient, the money realized from the attempted sale shall be treated as not applying to the payment of the attempted assessment, and shall not discharge any obligation of the owner of the property to bear a fair and just proportion of the cost of the local improvement for which the attempted assessment was made. Proceeds from the attempted sale shall be refunded to the Assessment Collection Fund and the Council may make a reassessment against that property.</p>

<p>The Assessment Collection Fund may also be used to purchase and hold warrants issued upon any special local improvement fund formed or to be formed. The face amount and interest on warrants so purchased shall be credited, upon payment, to the Assessment Collection Fund. [New sec. Nov. 8, 1966; am. Dec. 14, 1971; am. May 20, 1986; am.
