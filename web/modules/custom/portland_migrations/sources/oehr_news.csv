<p>January 27, 2014</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PORTLAND &ndash; The Portland Human Rights Commission (HRC) believes that Portland can reach its goal of shaping a police bureau that models community policing that serves everyone. To that end, the HRC encourages all community members to testify at a <a title=""Hearing Information"" href=""http://www.ord.uscourts.gov/index.php/information-regarding-fairness-hearing-in-u-s-v-city-of-portland"">Fairness Hearing</a> on February 18, 2014 at Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse, 1000 SW 3rd Ave. (Courtroom 13B) at 9:00 a.m., if they have experienced what they consider unreasonable use of force by members of the PPB, or if they can testify to unreasonable use of force used against a friend or family member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Albina Ministerial Alliance (AMA) Coalition for Justice and Police Reform has also organized several community forums in preparation for the Fairness Hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuesday, January 28 &bull; 6:30 p.m. - 8:30 p.m. &bull; First Unitarian Church &bull; 1011 SW 12th Ave.</li>
<li>Saturday, February 8 &bull; 2:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m.&bull; St Johns Community Center &bull; 8427 N Central St.</li>
<li>Thursday, February 13 &bull; 6:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. &bull; Rosewood Community Center &bull; 16126 SE Stark St.</li>
</ul>
<p>If&nbsp;community members&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;attend these events, the&nbsp;AMA Coalition is available to help you with preparing testimony for the hearing or to send to Judge Michael H. Simon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong></p>
<p>In 2012 the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and United States Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon (collectively ""DOJ"") reported on their investigation of the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s (PPB) use of force, revealing the PPB &ldquo;&hellip; engages in a pattern or practice of unnecessary or unreasonable force during interactions with people who have or are perceived to have mental illness.&rdquo; The U.S. then sued the City of Portland based on those findings. Intending to remedy the issues outlined in the DOJ findings, Council adopted a Settlement Agreement&nbsp;among the City of Portland, the Portland Police Association (PPA), and the US Department of Justice (DOJ). Following that, Federal Judge Michael Simon set a &ldquo;Fairness Hearing&rdquo; to allow the community to weigh in on whether the Agreement is ""fair, adequate and reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HRC Considerations:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The HRC recognizes the vital importance public participation and in this instance we are specifically guided by Article 21 (1) of the by UN Declaration of Human Rights: &ldquo;Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.&rdquo; Community testimony at the Fairness Hearing is important toward the process of strengthening the DOJ Agreement; a rare opportunity to improve police accountability in Portland.</li>
<li>The organizers of these events, members of the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform (AMA Coalition), have been working for ten years toward significant change in use of force policy and practices of the Portland Police Bureau, and they were granted ""enhanced amicus"" (friend of the court) status to the DOJ's lawsuit. They have designed these forums as a resource to community members in advance of the Fairness Hearing, to explain the purpose of the Fairness Hearing to the community and to provide support for testifying. This may include sending written or video testimony to Judge Simon for community members who cannot make the hearing date.</li>
<li>The HRC is supportive of strengthening the Agreement in order to obtain meaningful changes that make encounters with police safer for people with mental illness and to empower Portland&rsquo;s Police officers to serve more effectively and protect civil rights. While the DOJ investigation did not address use of force disparities based on race, the HRC also recognizes that many of these same PPB practices are experienced disproportionately by people of color, calling for increased attention around use of force related to race.</li>
</ol>

<p>For Immediate Release</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PORTLAND &ndash; In light of the forthcoming Fairness Hearing on the Department of Justice settlement agreement with the City of Portland and the Portland Police Bureau scheduled for February 18, 2014, the Portland Human Rights Commission (HRC) calls for strategic community involvement as the extent of the settlement process continues and as the implementation of the agreement moves forward.<br /><br />During the hearing on Tuesday, Judge Michael Simon will call for testimony from individuals and community organizations to determine whether the agreement is fair, adequate and reasonable. The agreement in question by Judge Michael Simon was initially reached between the City of Portland and the Department of Justice, following the Department of Justice&rsquo;s investigation into the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s use of force. The Fairness Hearing will be just the first of many opportunities for the community to play an active role in holding the Portland Police Bureau accountable for its actions as implementation begins.<br /><br />As a city-appointed commission whose responsibilities include advising City Council and bringing forward the voices of the community, the HRC realizes that ongoing input and collaboration will be required if those voices are to be heard and reflected during implementation. HRC Chair, Sonji Young says, &ldquo;The Department of Justice settlement is no different than any other situation that impacts members of our city&rsquo;s diverse community.&rdquo; Young added, &ldquo;Community members should expect to have their voices be present and weighed throughout any and all processes that impact their well being.""<br /><br />The HRC believes that participation of all segments of the community is required if concerns are to be amplified and elevated to action.&nbsp;Local organizations have hosted public forums aimed at answering the community&rsquo;s questions about the agreement. Having attended such forums, the HRC hopes to continue to hear directly from community members and call attention to the expressed suggestions or concerns that they raise. Most importantly, HRC will encourage City Council to consider emerging concerns raised by citizens and organizations during Tuesday&rsquo;s Fairness Hearing and requests that City Council exercise their option to discuss and request changes to the agreement, as highlighted in paragraph 187 of the agreement.<br /><br />The Portland Human Rights Commission (HRC) works to eliminate discrimination and bigotry, to strengthen inter-group relationships, and to foster greater understanding, inclusion, and justice for those who live, work, study, worship, travel and play in the City of Portland.<br /><br />For more information, please contact Aimee Samara at <a href=""mailto:saysamara7@gmail.com"">saysamara7@gmail.com</a></p>

Portland, OR 97231</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program will provide free legal counseling to anyone who believes they have been a victim of workplace related crime, including human trafficking. Most trafficking victims do not &ldquo;self-identify&rdquo; as such. Thus, an effective way to identify and assist trafficking victims and survivors is to provide legal counseling to those who believe they have been victimized in other related ways, including wage theft, workplace violence or threat of violence, or coercion to work by threats related to immigration status. Program participants will have access volunteer immigration attorneys and interpreters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program is co-sponsored by Oregonians Against Human Trafficking (OATH), the HRC Human Trafficking Task Force, the Oregon Chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, Immigration Counseling Service, and Catholic Charities.</p>

Based on the long-awaited outcome, the HRC stopped to applaud Judge Michael McShane&rsquo;s ruling, deeming the ban on gay marriage unconstitutional.</p>
<p class=""Default"">As a diverse body of leaders who represents all segments of the community including LGBTQ, the HRC sees this decision as one that sets Oregon apart from states that have yet to take a stance on the issue. HRC Chair and LGBTQ Ally, Sonji Young stated, &ldquo;To love is by far the greatest commitment that any of us can make in our lives.&nbsp; By removing the legal barriers, all of our fellow citizens can pursue happiness, regardless of their personal preference.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young added, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s decision demonstrates that love is indeed a human right. We all deserve to declare our love through marriage and have it recognized.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""Default"">HRC Commissioner Sam Sachs, who has long been a member of Portland&rsquo;s social justice community agreed with Young, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oregon has done the right thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PORTLAND &ndash; The City of Portland has removed language from its employment applications that states applicants may be required to sign a criminal history statement. Questions about criminal background, if relevant to a position, would be asked later in the hiring process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statements formerly included on City applications created a barrier for ex-offenders, giving many the perception that a criminal history could prevent them from gaining government employment with the City of Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a win-win,&rdquo; said Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;This removes a barrier to employment with the City, which will attract a more diverse pool of applicants to City jobs&mdash;one step in addressing the collective impact of crime. Stable employment significantly reduces recidivism rates, building stability and breaking the cycle of incarceration for people trying to get back on their feet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City joins more than 60 U.S. jurisdictions, including Multnomah County, in removing the barrier to employment for formerly incarcerated people. The nationwide campaign to remove these types of barriers is commonly called, &ldquo;Ban the Box,&rdquo; which refers to the question on employment applications that asks whether the applicant has been convicted of a crime or been incarcerated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can credit this policy change to the Governing for Racial Equity Conference that our office hosted in March,&rdquo; said Dante James, Office of Equity and Human Rights Bureau Director. &ldquo;After attending the conference, City Human Resources leaders took to heart the chilling outcome that these types of questions can have on former offenders during the job application process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights provides education and technical support to City staff and elected officials, leading to recognition and removal of systemic barriers to fair and just distribution of resources, access, and opportunity; starting with issues of race and disability.</p>

<p>PORTLAND &ndash; The Oregon Association for Liberia and Sierra Leone Community are organizing an event to raise awareness of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa and to collect donations for the relief effort. The event takes place Friday, September 19, from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at First Unitarian Church, 1034 SW 13th Ave, Portland, OR 97205. Organizers will share insight on epidemic conditions in West Africa and hope to collect donations in kind (medical gloves and masks for medical personnel, for example) and financial donations to support Ebola victims and families in Liberia and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is a global health issue,&rdquo; said Koffi Dessou from the City of Portland Office of Equity and Human Rights. &ldquo;This is an opportunity for city governments, county governments, Oregon communities, and international communities to come together to stop the spread of the virus and support the victims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Oregon Association for Liberia, doctors and nurses in the region were exposed to the deadly Ebola virus and are dying mainly due to insufficient medical protective gear, including gloves and masks. Although Doctors Without Borders is onsite and equipment is provided, the need is still huge and additional donations are necessary. An economic crisis has arisen from the epidemic as towns and rural areas now need money to buy bottled water to avoid contaminated sources.</p>
<p>Government agencies and community groups have come together to sponsor Friday&rsquo;s event, including the Office of Equity and Human Rights, Multnomah County Health Department, Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization (IRCO), Africa House, and First Unitarian Church.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the fear of Ebola is understandable, these students have been screened by the Centers for Disease Control and are being monitored by the Multnomah County Health Department,&rdquo; said Aimee Samara, Human Rights Commission chair. &ldquo;It is important that we honor their human rights and support their international educational experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission is guided by the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states, &ldquo;Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PORTLAND &ndash; Mayor Charlie Hales announced last week to City Bureau Directors that equity is one of three specific priorities in preparing the City&rsquo;s Fiscal Year 2015-16 budget.</p>
<p>Hales said he will focus any new General Fund resources on requests that make measureable progress in one or more of the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity and Opportunity: bolstering economic and housing opportunity for all Portlanders, as well as equity in service delivery</li>
<li>Complete Neighborhoods: extending Portland&rsquo;s vaunted livability to more areas of the City</li>
<li>Emergency Preparedness: equipping bureau operations and our citizens to better withstand a disaster</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;I am excited and encouraged that Mayor Hales is prioritizing equity in the City&rsquo;s budget process,&rdquo; said Dante James, Office of Equity and Human Rights director. &ldquo;Tying equity to City bureaus&rsquo; budgets ensures that leaders are considering the impacts of their programs and policies on all Portlanders. It&rsquo;s another positive step to institutionalizing this work within Portland city government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Effective last fiscal year, bureaus are required to use a Budget Equity Assessment Tool developed by the Office of Equity and Human Rights in preparing their budgets. The tool guides bureau leaders and their Budget Advisory Committees to determine how budget requests or decisions benefit and/or burden communities, specifically communities of color and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights provides education and technical support to City staff and elected officials, leading to recognition and removal of systemic barriers to fair and just distribution of resources, access, and opportunity; starting with issues of race and disability.</p>

<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I feel compelled to write a note to those of us who are more connected to the work of racial equity than others. Last night&rsquo;s decision was, and remains, difficult for many reasons, not the least of which is that a young man lost his life, and another&rsquo;s will be forever changed. My concern is the potential that was lost from the beginning of Michael Brown&rsquo;s life. Potential unavailable because of the history and present day oppressions and systems that make life difficult for many young Black men. My concern is that Michael Brown is being born every day, into the same systems and oppressions that make life difficult. My concern is that being a Black man, purely in and of itself, causes fear. My concern is that this will be a moment in time, not a movement, not a watershed moment that mandates the deconstruction of a system that is racist. The outcomes, the statistics, the deaths, the imprisonment, the inequality and inequity&hellip;.. their stories are incontrovertible. Yet they don&rsquo;t seem to be enough. What will be enough?&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that said, I have to believe that the work I do, the work we all do, is making a difference. I must believe it or I can&rsquo;t keep doing it. We have seen change here within the city structure and institution of the City of Portland. Small change is still change. Small change adds up to larger change.&nbsp; You, we, are making a difference. I am grateful for the work you do. Thank you.</p>

<p>January 29, 2015</p>
<p>PORTLAND &mdash; The Director of Portland's Office of Equity and Human Rights, Dante James, presented a report to City Council on Wednesday about three listening sessions with City employees. On December 3, December 10, and January 7, approximately 200 City employees voluntarily came together during their lunch hours to discuss the aftermath of the Ferguson grand jury decision&nbsp;from an institutional perspective.</p>
<p>Topics of discussion revolved around: institutional and systemic racism; implicit bias; community/police relations; police training; the feeling by people of color of disempowerment and fear; as well as how these issues were created and fostered the tinderbox that exploded in the days following Ferguson.</p>
<p>Subsequent to Ferguson and the death of Michael Brown came other deaths in other cities that were high profile deaths of Black men or teenagers at the hands of police. The Office of Equity and Human Rights felt it important to provide a space for voices to be heard and frustrations to be expressed.</p>
<p>Here are the attendees' recommendations that James presented to Council:</p>
<h3 class=""content-center"">Suggestions Specific to Police</h3>
<p><strong>Improve officer training</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bias training is critical: bias must be owned and faced</li>
<li>Have the courage to create conversations to talk specifically about fear and distrust on the part of both the community and the police</li>
<li>Continuing education for officers on bias, de-escalation techniques, and inter-personal skills, not just one-time sessions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Culture and Policy changes within the Police Bureau</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Need to change policies about engagement and expectations of interactions</li>
<li>Internal zero tolerance policies &ndash; visibly holding officers accountable for behavior that is unacceptable</li>
<li>Create a culture where peer reporting does not lead to ostracizing&nbsp;</li>
<li>Conduct psychological exams more often, instead of only upon hiring or after a police-involved shooting, in order to root out possible changes in officers&rsquo; psyches after several years on the job</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improve police and community interactions</strong></p>
<ol></ol>
<ul>
<li>Meet communities face-to-face and regularly (not only after incidents or at events). Engage in true community policing</li>
<li>Create requirements or incentives for police to live in communities they serve, e.g., Portland used to have a home-buying incentives program for officers</li>
<li>Create police/fire/ranger education programs and relationships for youth in schools and through grassroots efforts to better attract officers of color, not just depending on individual officers who do it on their own</li>
<li>Neighborhood structures, organizations or groups should be involved more in community policing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Make better efforts to diversify the Police Bureau</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Review criminal background check policies (e.g., if my cousin sold drugs years ago, it can prevent me from being hired by the city for public safety jobs)</li>
<li>Create a process where police work with Park Rangers to create a pipeline to becoming an officer; the police can benefit greatly from learning about rangers non-weapon carrying tactics</li>
</ul>
<h3 class=""content-center"">Suggestions for All City Employees and Elected Officials</h3>
<ul>
<li>There should be an extension of a program to aggressively diversify the workforce. Every bureau has an Affirmative Action Plan.&nbsp; Evaluate and report on them.</li>
<li>Hold managers/bureaus accountable for outcomes in hiring as well as outreach in order to hire more broadly</li>
<li>Cultural awareness in the workplace should be evaluated. Bureaus should conduct climate surveys to understand the impact of race at work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portland Police Chief, Larry O'Dea, testified in support of the report and announced that two vital Police Bureau positions would be filled soon:&nbsp;an Equity and Diversity Program Manager (who begins next week) and an analyst who will focus entirely on stops data, specifically on criminal justice inequities and implicit bias.</p>

<p>February 25, 2015</p>
<p>PORTLAND &ndash; The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, recognized today The City of Portland Community Engagement Liaison (CEL) Program as part of the 2015 Bright Ideas program. This year&rsquo;s cohort includes 124 programs from all levels of government&mdash;school districts; county, city, state, and federal agencies; as well as public-private partnerships&mdash;that are at the forefront in innovative government action.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s CEL Program identifies civic-minded individuals from vulnerable and underserved neighborhoods and provides them with training in collaboration and advocacy skills, creating a link between their communities and the City government, and allowing City bureaus to provide greater public involvement opportunities to more Portlanders. The program initiated in The Office of Equity and Human Rights and is now housed in the Office of Neighborhood Involvement&rsquo;s New Portlander Program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bright Ideas program demonstrates that often seemingly intractable problems can be creatively and capably tackled by small groups of dedicated, civic-minded individuals,&rdquo; said Stephen Goldsmith, director of the Innovations in Government Program at the Ash Center. &ldquo;As exemplified by this year&rsquo;s Bright Ideas, making government work better doesn&rsquo;t always require massive reforms and huge budgets. Indeed, we are seeing that, in many ways, an emphasis on efficiency and adaptability can have further-reaching effects than large-scale reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the fourth cohort recognized through the Bright Ideas program, an initiative of the broader Innovations in American Government Awards program. For consideration as a Bright Idea, programs must currently be in operation or in the process of launching and have sufficient operational resources and must be administered by one or more governmental entities; nonprofit, private sector, and union initiatives are eligible if operating in partnership with a governmental organization. Bright Ideas are showcased on the Ash Center&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.innovations.harvard.edu/"">Government Innovators Network</a>, an online platform for practitioners and policymakers to share innovative public policy solutions.</p>
<p><strong>About the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation</strong><br />The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation advances excellence in governance and strengthens democratic institutions worldwide. Through its research, education, international programs, and government innovations awards, the Center fosters creative and effective government problem solving and serves as a catalyst for addressing many of the most pressing needs of the world&rsquo;s citizens.

<p>Portland &mdash; The Director of Portland's Office of Equity and Human Rights, Dante James, presented the office&rsquo;s 2014 Annual Report to City Council today, three days after the bureau&rsquo;s third anniversary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must offer significant thanks to the many employees who have taken on the task of making the city of Portland a place where everyone can feel welcome, heard, and valued,&rdquo; James said. &ldquo;Equity is at the heart of how the City provides its services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James also acknowledged the work of the various commissions, employee groups, and community organizations who partner with the office to address systemic issues facing Portlanders.</p>
<p>Community members and City bureau partners testified in support of the office&rsquo;s work and Council members gave kudos as well:</p>
<p><strong>Commissioner&nbsp;Amanda Fritz</strong><br />&ldquo;This is good to celebrate the achievements of the Office of Equity and Human Rights which was so difficult to form&hellip;We&rsquo;ve had a lot of criticism from folks who say we haven&rsquo;t done enough and we haven&rsquo;t done it fast enough&mdash;both of those are correct&mdash;but I&rsquo;m very pleased to celebrate what we have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Commissioner&nbsp;Nick Fish</strong><br />&ldquo;We have a chance to work pretty regularly with members of your equity team on various matters, so I just want to acknowledge the great team you have and their professionalism.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Commissioner&nbsp;Steve Novick</strong><br />&ldquo;I want to express my appreciation to Council members who created this office because it was controversial at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Commissioner Dan Saltzman</strong><br />&ldquo;Dante, I want to thank you, the Commission on Disability, the Human Rights Commission, and the staff for really giving great legs to this office and getting things done.</p>
<p><strong>Mayor Charlie Hales</strong><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built some strength here and we need it because there&rsquo;s lots of work to do. There are old issues of racism and injustice in our city and there are new ones, too, because Portland is becoming this amazing magnet for people from all over the world to move here. And we have to make sure that this is a just and open society for new Portlanders, just like we need to for those of us who grew up here.&rdquo;</p>

My father was the grandson of a slave, his father the son of a slave. I have photos of my great grandfather taken after emancipation.&nbsp; I am the great grandson of a slave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversations about race, racism, bigotry, the confederate flag, historic oppression; these conversations are not abstract discussions for me, nor for many others who can trace their immediate lineage to slavery. I knew the son and grandson of a slave, my grandfather and father.&nbsp; I can still feel my grandfather&rsquo;s beautiful, smooth, dark leathery skin, wince at the remembered harshness of his whiskers, and hear the gruffness of his voice.&nbsp; They are both long since gone, and the chance to, as an adult, hear the stories of how lives were lived is no longer available.&nbsp; It is my obligation to not forget, to consciously remember, my history and who I am.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The events of last week, last month, last year, and the years gone by, create a constant weariness in me, and those who look like me.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t always articulate it, but as Black folks, we are always wondering what the next horrific example of racism will be.&nbsp; Wondering what new story will emerge describing how we were experimented on by the government, (the most recent NPR story describing a WW II experiment when Black men were locked in a room and subjected to chemical weapons to see if dark skin was more resistant than white skin).&nbsp; I am tired.&nbsp; I am weary.&nbsp; I am motivated to try to help non-Black folks understand.&nbsp; But why do I need to explain why the confederate flag is a gross reminder of what my father, grandfather and great grandfather had to suffer?&nbsp; Why do I need to explain why diffusing the conversation about racism by describing the murderer as &ldquo;mentally unstable&rdquo; does not acknowledge the fact that the immediate cause of his acts in that church, murdering those African American men and women, was racism, not mental illness?&nbsp; Why do I need to explain that the problem is not with Black folks, but with White folks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My current job is to address institutional racism in government.&nbsp; How do I help my peers, my colleagues, my bosses understand the need to say something, to express that they hear, see and feel the pain that this mass murder has caused?&nbsp; This was an act of terrorism, nothing less.&nbsp; The perception of constant attack on Blackness; whether by killing or failing to care, killing or failing to provide needed and deserved services, killing or ignoring, killing or failing to speak, killing or refusing to lower a flag in respect&hellip;..all are wounds that infect the system, the system of a person&rsquo;s biology or the system of government.</p>
<p>I and all who look like me will persevere because that is who we are and what we do.&nbsp; My father, grandfather and great grandfather deserve no less. &nbsp;</p>","https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oehr/article/535264",

<p>PORTLAND &ndash; The City of Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights will present its City-wide Racial Equity Goals and Strategies to City Council, tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. at City Hall.</p>

<p>Community members and City employees will be present to testify in support of adopting the goals and strategies.</p>
<p>QUOTES:</p>
<p>Dante James, Bureau Director:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have looked across the country at various best practices for racial equity work and produced a set of three overall city-wide goals that are fairly wide-raging and all-encompassing. These goals may be specifically couched in terms of racial equity, but achieving these goals will help provide greater benefits for everyone as they receive the services of the City.</p>
<p>Mayor Charlie Hales:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a very diverse city. And racial equity means understanding both that diversity today and the institutional racism and historical wrongs that underlie that diversity, even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights provides education and technical support to City staff and elected officials, leading to recognition and removal of systemic barriers to fair and just distribution of resources, access, and opportunity; starting with issues of race and disability.</p>

<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights, Portland Commission on Disability, and community partners invite the community to attend a celebration of the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on Sunday, July 26<sup>th</sup> from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. The ADA 25 event will be held at Immigrant &amp; Refugee Community Organization (IRCO) located at 10301 NE Glisan St. Portland, OR 97220. The ADA is a landmark civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life.</p>
<p>The celebration&rsquo;s theme is &ldquo;Sharing Our Histories, Dreaming Our Future&rdquo; and features storytellers who will share their personal experiences of living with disabilities. The storytelling project is made possible by an expanding cultural access grant from the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council. The storytelling portion of the celebration will give the audience and those unfamiliar with the disability community an array of voices and disabilities, and an opportunity to hear from individuals from varied cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s Commission on Disability&rsquo;s mission is to guide the City in ensuring that it is a more universally accessible city for all. Despite advances in the ADA, people with disabilities still face barriers to employment, housing, transportation and other basic needs. Portland Commission on Disability works to bring a cross-disability perspective to City policy development and decision-making.</p>
<p>For questions on how to participate, volunteer, or sponsor, contact Phillip Hillaire, ADA 25 Event Coordinator, at 503-823-5146.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other details:</strong> City Council members will be present. Community organization-hosted tables will be on display. ASL and audio description will be provided. All video will be captioned. Universally accessible event.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes:</strong></p>
<p>Lavaun Heaster, Chair, Portland Commission on Disability:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How often do most people get the opportunity to sit down with folks from a variety of disability communities and really hear their truth? For me this event is so exciting because I feel that the stories of folks with disabilities are so silent in the broader storytelling community and I want to laugh, cry, feel outraged and touched with members of all my communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan Stroud, Storytelling Coach/Workshop Facilitator:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of four workshops, participants worked together to choose a true, personal story about their lived experience, and to prepare their stories for the stage. This process facilitated the creation of narratives that revealed both their universal and unique experiences, helping their audience gain a more complex view of what it is like to live with a disability.&rdquo;</p>","https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oehr/article/537948",

<p><strong>Oregon&rsquo;s Alisha Zhao, 16, Selected to Serve as a National Child Awareness Month Youth Ambassador</strong></p>
<p><em>Zhao to receive funding, training to lead large-scale service initiative to create positive change in the lives of Oregon</em><em>&rsquo;s children</em></p>
<p><strong>Washington, D.C. (</strong><strong>June 30, 2015) &ndash;</strong>YSA (Youth Service America) and Festival of Children Foundation announce that Alisha Zhao<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of Oregon will serve as a National Child Awareness Month Youth Ambassador. As one of 51 Youth Ambassadors selected from a nationwide pool, Alisha will receive funding and training to lead an initiative to counteract the negative effects poverty has on childhood development through providing youth experiencing homelessness with affordable and convenient programs in the areas of education, creativity, physical activity, and health.</p>
<p>Alisha&rsquo;s work begins in September&mdash;National Child Awareness Month&mdash; when she travels to Washington, D.C., for leadership training and meetings with members of the state&rsquo;s congressional delegation. She then returns home to launch her nonprofit, Kids First Project, which addresses Oregon&rsquo;s issue of being ranked 46<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;in the nation for early childhood education as well as its lack of recreational programs for disadvantaged youth. Its mission is&nbsp;to promote HOPE - Health, Opportunity, Play, and Education - by raising awareness on the lack of funding going towards disadvantaged children, providing the resources necessary for children experiencing homelessness to reach their full potential, freeing up time for parents to find housing, and ultimately breaking the intergenerational cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>Alisha was selected through a competitive application process, and chosen based on the quality of her project proposal and its potential to create substantive, large-scale change on behalf of young people in Oregon.</p>
<p>Now in its eighth year, National Child Awareness Month is a program spearheaded by Festival of Children Foundation to raise awareness about issues affecting children&nbsp;<strong>and encourage the nation's youth to take action.</strong></p>
<p>The 51 Youth Ambassadors will work in their communities, and form a collective network to raise awareness around issues important to young people. Youth Ambassadors receive a national-level platform for their cause; a $1,000 grant to develop a service project his or her home state; ongoing training and project guidance; and networking opportunities with other Youth Ambassadors across the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These teens and young adults are the future of philanthropy. They understand the importance of making a difference and giving back. Festival of Children Foundation&rsquo;s collaboration with YSA allows us to give these kids the tools to create a powerful youth network that will create lasting change across the country,&rdquo; said Sandy Segerstrom Daniels, founder and executive director of Festival of Children Foundation.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Ms. Alisha Zhao is a junior at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon. With a passion for human rights and service, Alisha is the first youth to ever serve on her city&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission. She is also the founder of Lincoln&rsquo;s Hope For Homeless Club and the nonprofit, Kids First Project. Alisha has been recognized through the Dr. Arnold Rustin Award, Civic Award, KATU News, and ANNpower Fellowship. While being involved in government and community service, she maintains a 4.0 GPA and participates in the International Baccalaureate program. In her free time, she enjoys cooking, playing lacrosse, and reading. Alisha aspires to someday work for the United Nations with a double major in political science and international relations.</p>

"News",550944,"City of Portland Human Rights Commission Endorses Occupation-Free Portland’s Proposed Statement to the Socially Responsive Investments Committee",1,"","2015-10-30 15:45:28 UTC","2015-10-30 15:36:00 UTC","A","","<p><img title=""HRC Logo"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=550950"" alt=""HRC Logo"" width=""470"" height=""246"" /></p>
<p>October 29, 2015</p>
<p>On October 7, 2015, the Portland Human Rights Commission (HRC) unanimously voted to support Occupation-Free Portland&rsquo;s request to the City&rsquo;s Socially Responsible Investments committee (SRI) to place four U.S. companies on the City&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do Not Buy&rdquo; list: Caterpillar, G4S, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a commission guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, HRC based its decision to endorse Occupation-Free Portland&rsquo;s letter solely on the four companies&rsquo; involvement in human rights violations in Israel and Palestine. This was not an issue relating to religion or nationality, but solely on human rights impacts, and a request to the City of Portland to divest from companies profiting from violent conflict.<br /><br /></li>
<li>HRC&rsquo;s endorsement of the letter was specifically for the Occupation-Free Portland request to be presented to SRI, where that City body would use their process to determine whether the request fits their guidelines for recommendation to Council.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The process that led to HRC&rsquo;s endorsement of the letter began with public testimony at HRC&rsquo;s September 2, 2015 meeting. After hearing from numerous community members, HRC requested additional information and additional time for review; and communicated to attendees that the commission would hold a vote at the October 7, 2015 meeting. This process allowed Human Rights Commissioners a full month between the time the request was introduced, to the time at which the vote took place.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Regardless of any post-meeting renouncements, the unanimous vote stands unless another full-Commission vote takes place.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Our job as Human Rights Commissioners is to hear and take action on human rights issues,&rdquo; said Audrey Alverson, HRC vice chair. &ldquo;This work, by default, is difficult and uncomfortable and often involves push back. We recognize that many issues we are asked to consider are complex and multi-faceted; and as a commission, we work to hold true to our mission of upholding the ideals expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ideal that those rights are endowed to all human beings, regardless of their politics. Our decisions may be unpopular to some or even to the majority, but human rights issues wouldn&rsquo;t exist if these positions were popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an all-volunteer advisory body to City of Portland&rsquo;s elected leaders, the HRC is not charged with making decisions nor declarations on City policy, but rather with advising elected leaders on human rights issues within the city. One avenue through which HRC&rsquo;s advisory statements and endorsements are informed is by receiving community input in a variety of forums, including regularly scheduled public comment at HRC&rsquo;s monthly meetings.</p>
<p>The HRC works to eliminate discrimination and bigotry, to strengthen inter-group relationships, and to foster greater understanding, inclusion, and justice for those who live, work, study, worship, travel and play in the City of Portland.</p>

<p>Honorable Mayor Charlie Hales and City Commissioners<br />City Hall, 1221 SW 4th Ave.<br />Portland, OR, 97204</p>
<p>Re: Open Letter of Support for Resolution to support Muslim and Immigrant Community Members</p>
<p>To Mayor Hales, and Commissioners Fritz, Novick, Saltzman, and Fish:</p>
<p>The City of Portland Human Rights Commission commends the action taken by the City and writes in support of <a title=""Link to Resolution"" href=""/auditor/article/557025"">resolution 1334-1</a> which declared support for the City&rsquo;s Muslim community and reaffirms Portland&rsquo;s welcoming nature for all immigrants and refugees.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, December 16, 2015 the City took an important step forward in supporting and protecting our fellow community members in a manner that upholds human rights and moves us closer towards building a more inclusive place for all who live, work, play, and worship in the City of Portland.</p>
<p>As a commission we thank you and we urge you to continue to stand strong in the face of bigotry, racism, and discrimination in all of its forms both overt and systemic.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission is guided by the principles of the United Nation&rsquo;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We believe that any attempts to restrict the movement of individuals based on their religious affiliations is in direct conflict with the Declaration&rsquo;s Article 2, which embodies freedom from discrimination based on several distinctions, including religion; and Article 18, which affirms the right to freedom of religion for all.</p>
<p>In recent weeks the state of the national political landscape and the rhetoric that continues to be shared means that the concept of human rights itself for ALL is being questioned and the concept of eliminating discrimination and bigotry is something that seems to be under fire.</p>
<p>As the City of Portland Human Rights Commission we want you to know that if the same rights that we fight for and are privileged to have today are not afforded to our friends, family members, classmates, co-workers, and community members who identify as Muslim, our work is far from over. Your action taken on December 16th is indicative of leaders who are working on the right side of history to support us all.</p>
<p>We recognize the strength and vital nature in aligning as a community to support all community members and the intentionality necessary to specifically protect our Muslim community members at a time such as this. Thank you for your leadership in this effort and for the sponsorship of and unanimous vote in support for resolution 1334-1.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Chabre Vickers<br />Chair, City of Portland Human Rights Commission</p>

"News",571047,"Office of Equity and Human Rights Presents 2015 Annual Report to City Council",1,"","2016-04-12 20:37:27 UTC","","A","Report unanimously accepted by Council","<p>March 30, 2016</p>
<p>PORTLAND &mdash; Dante J. James, director of Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights (OEHR), presented the bureau&rsquo;s Annual Report for 2015 to City Council today.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" title=""Photo of Dante J. James"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=571043"" alt=""Photo of Dante J. James"" width=""250"" height=""166"" />James reviewed equity highlights from the past calendar year and offered a glimpse of works in progress, including the Five-Year Bureau Racial Equity Plan process that each City bureau is undergoing. He added that the office will expand its engagement on the issue of disability, saying that Portland can become a leader in disability equity work just as it has become a national model in racial equity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we are now in the most difficult phase of this work,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Beginning this work was actually easier than where we are now. This City is truly a national model, but we still have work to do. We are now at a place where many staff believe they ""get it."" Unfortunately, for some, there is not yet the depth of understanding of root causes that are continuing to create disparities or of the opportunities we can create that would benefit everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Community members provided testimony in support of the office&rsquo;s efforts to institutionalize equity in City policies, practices, and procedures.</p>
<p>OEHR Bureau Advisory Committee Member, Ranfis Giannettino Villatoro, said there is a general fear in the community about &ldquo;equity&rdquo; being a buzzword or a flavor of the month, like &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; and &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; in the past.<img class=""content-right"" title=""Photo of Ranfis Giannettino Villatoro"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=571045"" alt=""Photo of Ranfis Giannettino Villatoro"" width=""250"" height=""166"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;These aren&rsquo;t mere buzzwords for us. What we&rsquo;re really talking about is addressing institutional racism and implicit bias, and I think OEHR and the City have done much to advance how the City sees equity&hellip;but I think there are still challenges ahead,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Villatoro said the City should work with more urgency to address disparities for communities of color: &ldquo;Now is a great moment to continue these conversations and to develop these strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland disability commissioner, Philip Wolfe, thanked Council for the bold risk in passing the captioning ordinance for televisions in public venues&mdash;an issue that Wolfe advocated for passionately on behalf of deaf and hard-of-hearing Portlanders. He also thanked Director James and OEHR staff for supporting the Portland Commission on Disability.</p>
<p>City Attorney, Tracy Reeve, lauded OEHR Senior Policy Advisor, Judith Mowry, and staff for developing and hosting a two-day educational convening for City and regional government lawyers with the Government Alliance on Race and Equity and john a. powell. She also mentioned her appreciation for the equity training and consultation her office has received from OEHR.</p>
<p>Before the Council vote, James presented each commissioner with a City Council Equity Lens card that included four simple equity questions they should ask themselves before introducing or voting on City policy proposals:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1. Is my implicit bias impacting how I think about this issue?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2. How will this issue impact communities of color?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3. How will this issue impact people with disabilities?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4. Is there an opportunity to reduce disparities?</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img title=""City Council Equity Lens"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=571040"" alt=""Picture of Council Equity Lens (text below picture)"" width=""600"" height=""388"" /></p>
<p>Commissioner Steve Novick thanked James for the equity lens and said he would keep it in front of him, at his desk, at all times.</p>
<p>Novick also thanked OEHR for its involvement in the City budget process: &ldquo;The budget is how we express our values, so the work of the office in the budget process is critically important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Amanda Fritz thanked OEHR staff for its racial equity work as well as its focus on communities with disabilities, specifically the Americans with Disabilities Title II Transition Plan process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work is not done,&rdquo; Fritz said. &ldquo;We have definitely made a good start and equity has started to become something that many more City employees and people in the community understand, embrace, and care about passionately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Referencing OEHR&rsquo;s skeptics and barriers during its formation, Commissioner Nick Fish thanked Fritz for being a fierce champion in developing the office, and Mayor Charlie Hales for his leadership of the bureau in recent years.</p>
<p>To further institutionalize equity, Fish suggested including clear equity expectations in Bureau Directors&rsquo; annual letters and to work with OEHR to develop implementation plans and metrics for the directors.</p>
<p>Hales thanked James, OEHR staff, and the volunteers who serve on the Portland Commission on Disability, Human Rights Commission, Black Male Achievement Steering Committee, and Diverse and Empowered Employees of Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the training and the work that you do, I&rsquo;ve learned that as a privileged White male, I&rsquo;m perhaps not to blame for racism, but I&rsquo;m responsible for it and that&rsquo;s true for all of us,&rdquo; Hales said. &ldquo;We have the chance to learn where we fit in the work of equity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As many of us shudder with shock, fear, and anxiety today, there are folks who are saying, &ldquo;Everything will be okay.&rdquo; Their intentions are good, but the truth is, so many of us do not feel that everything will be okay. It feels like dangerous times are ahead. It feels like many of us will be ignored, harassed, or marginalized just because of what we look like, what we sound like, what first language we speak, what headdress or clothing we may wear, and how we look at life in a non-corporate, humanistic way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, we need to look out for and support each other. Now, more than ever, we must organize, unify, and fight the fight of our lives. We cannot be silenced or pushed to the side. We have to explain to our children that hate and fear are not our allies. We have to be prepared to stand up for those who can&rsquo;t stand up for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take time to breathe, reflect, talk with each other, and re-commit to making this city, this state, and this country a better place for everyone.

We have made progress&mdash;changes have been made in how the City does business and minimizes detrimental impacts to communities of color.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re ready, please join us in moving equity forward. It won&rsquo;t feel okay for a long time, but I know we&rsquo;re going to see a social justice movement more energized, more passionate, and fiercer than we have seen in decades. Institutional racism exists, it is fueled by individual acts of bigotry and expressed in the halls of government and corporate America.

<p>Honorable Mayor Ted Wheeler<br />City Commissioners<br />City Hall, 1221 SW 4th Ave.<br />Portland, OR, 97204</p>
<p>Re: Request for Clarification of and Accountability for the City of Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; Status; Racial Profiling Notification; and Request for a Religious Registry Involvement Ban</p>
<p>Dear Mayor Wheeler, Commissioner Fritz, Commissioner Eudaly, Commissioner Fish, and Commissioner Saltzman:</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s public support of Portland&rsquo;s existing &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; status has been vital to allaying the concerns and fears of so many in our community who face possible deportation and familial breakup, who rely on critical public resources, and who have and continue to face acts of intimidation and hate.&nbsp; His resolve to reaffirm the inherent dignity and value of immigrant communities in the City by protecting their legal rights and by condemning the segregation of people based on their immigration status is impactful.&nbsp; The Human Rights Commission commends Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s position and stands with him and the entire Council as we advance together into an undetermined and perhaps gravely unstable period.</p>
<p>Request for Clarification of and Accountability for the City of Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; Status</p>
<p>The Commission asks that the City strengthen its &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; position by specifying what precisely it means for our community and particularly for City employees. &nbsp;While promising to restrict participation in assisting the Federal Government&rsquo;s efforts by asking the Portland Police Bureau to not act as agents for U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement (hereafter, ICE) is significant, it still leaves community members legally, economically, politically, and socially vulnerable because there is no fixed or definitive meaning of &ldquo;Sanctuary City.&rdquo;&nbsp; This has resulted in each city articulating the status differently. Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, for example, have enacted local city laws and other cities have provided legal protection to their immigrant communities through city ordinance or resolution.&nbsp; Portland, however, has not.</p>
<p>Our request is informed by Article 2 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights which guarantees individuals religious rights, and states:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status...[and that] no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission&rsquo;s request echoes the City of Portland&rsquo;s Resolution 37172 that was signed by Mayor Hales and adopted by Council on December 16, 2015.&nbsp; Then elected officials declared the City&rsquo;s support of Portland&rsquo;s Muslim community by denouncing open acts of bigotry and discrimination towards their members and by reaffirming the City&rsquo;s commitment to accept and to include them especially immigrants and refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission recognizes that Oregon State law prohibits state and local government personnel from assisting in or using public resources to enforce immigration laws and that there is a Constitutional basis for noncooperation because of state&rsquo;s rights and probable cause Amendments. The Commission believes, however, that adopting a Portland-specific definition will mitigate future confusion, and allow community members to seek informed legal assistance.</p>
<p>It will also go a long way towards building trust between the city&rsquo;s immigrant communities and employees. &nbsp;Research has consistently shown that if immigrant communities are mistrusting or fearful of local government agencies and their representatives they become isolated to protect themselves and their families. This is of great concern because without trust in local law enforcement, for example, the city&rsquo;s immigrant communities may not cooperate with their efforts to keep them safe.&nbsp; People who would take advantage, intimidate, and harm these communities are then unrestricted and violence or human rights violations against them are inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We ask that a definition also include language about how the City will hold accountable employees who disregard the policy and that it be cross-jurisdictional to reflect a collaborative commitment to upholding Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; status.&nbsp; A recent incident involving a Multnomah County deputy who allegedly communicated the location of an undocumented community member to ICE, speaks to the necessity and urgency of providing more formal direction to City employees, and ideally collaboration with Multnomah County.</p>
<p>Finally, the Human Rights Commission would like to draw attention to the absence of formal policy or law that prevents the City of Portland from adjusting their view and extinguishing &ldquo;Sanctuary City&rdquo; status without notice. The importance of creating an official and long-term commitment is supported by data that confirm bias crimes and other abuses towards immigrant communities have escalated in recent months and that bigotry and violence will continue to increase in the future.&nbsp; We base this assertion on research and reports generated by local and national immigrant legal defense organizations, immigrant advocacy groups, and law enforcement; on personal stories reported to or shared directly with the City of Portland&rsquo;s Human Rights Commission; historic and current national rhetoric; and a recent pattern of unrestrained dispatching of legal mandates by the Federal Government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Racial Profiling Notification</p>
<p>The Commission would like to encourage all of our elected officials to scrutinize and to make available to City employees and the public ICE&rsquo;s protocol for identifying people whom they believe are in violation of Federal immigration policies.&nbsp; We believe that express direction to the Portland Police Bureau, in particular, is appropriate.&nbsp; The few comments offered by ICE representatives to media about how they select who to question have lacked details. Media reports and law enforcement statements, however, have minimally confirmed that &ldquo;plainclothes ICE officers&rdquo; have targeted people in the Multnomah County courthouse by reading dockets, and others assert that their protocol appears, in part, to rely on racial profiling. Without an understanding of ICE&rsquo;s official protocol Portland&rsquo;s immigrant communities face tremendous uncertainty about their safety, security, and value as members of our community. Their concerns and fears will likely intensify if Federal ICE efforts expand beyond our courthouses directly into these communities.</p>
<p>Request for a Religious Registry Involvement Ban</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission condemns religious registries.&nbsp; They unjustly deny an individual&rsquo;s right to privacy and expose them to public scorn.&nbsp; Article 12 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: &ldquo;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Department of Homeland Security determined over a decade ago that their National Security Entry-Exit Registration System program (hereafter, NSEER&rsquo;S) that required the collection of information on the basis of religious affiliation was &ldquo;redundant, inefficient, and [provides] no increase in security [or] discernible public benefit,&rdquo; the program was never officially terminated. This means that the Federal Government can resume the collection of these data at their discretion by either recycling NSEER&rsquo;S or by inventing a new program. Many government officials and spokespeople deny that Executive Order 13769 is a ban on religious affiliation, but it is clear that Muslim communities are being targeted. This makes it necessary to be proactive in stating the City&rsquo;s position on religious registries in anticipation of Federal actions.</p>
<p>Officially banning a religious registry is in line with similar actions taken by national lawmakers, and by state and city lawmakers (especially those with large immigrant communities). In November 2016, Bill H. R. 6382 known as the &ldquo;No Religious Registry Act&rdquo; was introduced in the House. Its intent is stated as follows: &ldquo;To prohibit the collection of information and the establishment or utilization of a registry for the purposes of classifying certain United States persons and other individuals on the basis of religious affiliation, and for other purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On February 2, 2017, Oregon&rsquo;s Governor Brown issued an Executive Order that &ldquo;forbids state agencies from using public resources to help create a religious registry,&rdquo; (she also publicly declared her obligation to protect the &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; of all Oregonians). The City of Spokane, Washington passed a religious registry ban ordinance January 30, 2017, and the City of San Francisco, California passed Senate Resolution 16 on the same day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission therefore requests that as elected officials each of you publicly denounce and work towards instituting a ban that prevents City employees from being involved in the creation of or cooperating with a registry. These actions are critical to help ensure the safety and security of all community members, and speak to several principles that our city has embraced. It will iterate the City&rsquo;s goals of Public Impact and Livability and Security that are consequential in safeguarding everyone&rsquo;s right to have meaningful and positive experiences with each other and City government.&nbsp; And, it will underscore the significance of Portland&rsquo;s core values in creating and maintaining those relationships - notably equity, inclusion, and social sustainability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Michele Wilson<br />Human Rights Commissioner</p>

<p>Racism and White supremacy. As we grieve the loss of Rick Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche, many of us have noticed a common thread in the discussion around their murders. Media coverage and public conversations include terms like, &ldquo;standing up to hate,&rdquo; &ldquo;the alt-right,&rdquo; &ldquo;ethnic slurs&rdquo; and &ldquo;biased language.&rdquo; This incident was fueled by racism and White supremacy, period. To call it anything less is to ignore the fundamental reason for the murders. Unless we acknowledge this reality and use these words, we will not be able to address the root causes of the problem. Words matter.</p>
<p>The reality is that people of color experience racism and harassment every day in Portland. We fear for our children and ourselves because the current political and social climate has emboldened bigots and White supremacists to be more comfortable, public, and aggressive with their hate. We are frustrated and disgusted when folks are surprised that such overt racism and hatred could exist in progressive, Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>We need to be willing to admit that racism exists in our community and explore the root causes of blatant aggression. White allies must not assume that they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;got this,&rdquo; just because they consider themselves progressive or liberal. They must be willing to admit that in addition to the rise of deliberate racist aggression, under Portland&rsquo;s progressive veneer hide layers of institutional racism and a long history of oppression against people of color. The hard truth is that Portland is progressive in a way that benefits White, straight, able-bodied, Christian men. Look at the data before you jump to the defense of Portlandia.</p>
<p>So, what are you willing to do to fight racism and help dismantle White supremacy? Educating yourself about Oregon and Portland&rsquo;s racist history of exclusion and violence against people of color, and understanding how the ghosts of that not-so-distant past still haunt us today, are good first steps.</p>
<p>You can also ask yourself a couple of questions, &ldquo;Why does it take the death of two clearly courageous White men to spark this huge outcry, while many were silent after young and Black Larnell Bruce was run down and murdered by White supremacists last year in Gresham?&rdquo; Do you notice any reluctance or discomfort on your part to use terms like, &ldquo;racism,&rdquo; &ldquo;White supremacy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;genocide?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why or why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Connecting with, and supporting, social justice organizations will make you a better ally, and elevating conversations about racism and White supremacy in your existing networks will also help the fight.</p>
<p>If it is a true aphorism that, &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t go within, we will go without,&rdquo; then we must look within ourselves, and at our governmental actions, to determine why we cannot use the language of reality.&nbsp; People of color are going without and dying, and we do not have the luxury of talking in euphemisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot solve a problem that we are unable to correctly define.</p>

James resigns, Mayor Wheeler appoints Koffi Dessou as Interim Director",1,"","2017-12-07 22:22:35 UTC","2017-12-07 22:21:00 UTC","A","","<p>PORTLAND &ndash; Dante J. James, Director of The City of Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights (OEHR), has announced his resignation. James is moving to Colorado to reunite with his family. His last day at the City is December 15, 2017.</p>
<p>James was hired as the first director of OEHR in March, 2012, and has led significant efforts to remove barriers in government for Portlanders of color and people with disabilities. Under his leadership, OEHR elevated the discussion and awareness of racial issues in the city, in order to reduce disparities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dante&rsquo;s work was instrumental in creating the budget equity tool and our plan to enhance equitable workforce development in city construction projects through our Community Equity and Inclusion Plan, which was unanimously adopted by City Council this year, among many accomplishments,&rdquo; said Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;His leadership at the helm of OEHR will be sorely missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Wheeler has named OEHR Equity and Business Operations Manager, Koffi Dessou, as Interim Bureau Director. Dessou&rsquo;s contributions to the City include creating the City's Equity Training and Education Program; co-designing and facilitating training sessions; providing technical support for bureau directors, equity committees and managers; and working with the City&rsquo;s senior staff and Commissioners' offices on policy improvement, research design, program evaluation, and policy recommendations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank Dante for his leadership and am excited about this opportunity,&rdquo; said Dessou. &ldquo;We will continue to build momentum in our efforts to institutionalize equity in City government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Office of Equity and Human Rights provides education and technical support to City staff and elected officials, leading to recognition and removal of systemic barriers to fair and just distribution of resources, access, and opportunity; starting with issues of race and disability.</p>

<p>This will be the first time I&rsquo;ve been placed in charge of a utility bureau. One of my goals is to end my tenure with accolades similar to a City Commission report on Water Bureau operations in 1894:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;millions of dollars have been spent, a great public work carried to completion; no scandal exists; no charges of mal-administration are made; not even a hint of peculation is suggested&hellip;.The work of the Committee is practically done.&nbsp; It must be judged by its works.&nbsp; The City of Portland will have a supply of water which for purity is probably unexcelled anywhere in the world.&nbsp; How much this will count for the future health and happiness of its citizens cannot be measured.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I am also now in charge of the Office of Equity and Human Rights, a bureau I created in 2011 with Mayor Sam Adams.&nbsp; The Office was initiated to promote opportunities for all Portlanders in City jobs, contracts, and services.&nbsp; While we have made progress in those areas,&nbsp;more improvements are needed.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am excited to work with the staff in Equity, our community, and Mayor Wheeler to take this crucial work to the next level.&nbsp; The Water Bureau&nbsp;offers a significant opportunity in this arena, with a $500,000 million investment in water protection upcoming and many good labor jobs within the bureau and in contracts every year.&nbsp; PWB Director Mike Stuhr and Interim Equity Director Koffi Dessou will be my trusted partners.&nbsp; Interim Parks Director Kia Selley is doing amazing work in PP&amp;R, and has my full support as she works with Commissioner Fish.</p>
<p>I thank everyone who has supported, visited, and enjoyed our parks system during my time as Parks Commissioner. I have deeply appreciated the opportunity to work with thousands of hard-working, dedicated staff and community members. I am more than happy with all the great accomplishments we have achieved together! The hard work and advocacy of many people in our community has led to significant investments throughout our City including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allocating more than $65 million towards closing park service gaps in East Portland</li>
<li>Creating six new parks &ndash; Luuwit View, Gateway Discovery, Gateway Green, Spring Garden, Khunamokwst, and Cully</li>
<li>Dedicating over $28 million to build Errol Heights and Parklane Parks over the next few years</li>
<li>Expanding inclusive play areas all over the city, and designating three new parks as fully-integrated adaptive play areas - Gateway Discovery, Couch, and Gabriel.&nbsp; When Couch and Gabriel are completed, there will be inclusive parks in N, NW, SW, and East Portland</li>
<li>Passing and implementing the $68 million Parks Fix Our Parks Bond,</li>
<li>The largest five-year expansion of restroom capacity in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s history, including significant investments in all-user facilities, the spectacular Pioneer Courthouse Square restroom renovation, and ten new loos</li>
<li>Creating/updating Master Plans at Mill, Midland, SE 150<sup>th</sup>/Division and Washington Parks</li>
<li>Creating an Equity Manager and team to ensure that issues of equity are considered as a top priority for the bureau, and empowering employees to create and advance the Racial Equity Plan and Accessibility Transition Plan</li>
<li>Creating the Parks for New Portlanders Program</li>
<li>Expanding the Park Ranger team, especially in underserved areas of the City</li>
<li>Improving labor relations and supporting creation of new bargaining units for Recreation and Rangers, with over 100 new union positions</li>
<li>Creating City policy that has mandated allocation of over $60 million so far towards major maintenance needs in infrastructure bureaus including PP&amp;R</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to the staff in my office who have been particularly engaged in Parks issues: Tom Bizeau, Patti Howard, Tim Crail, Pooja Bhatt, and Cristina Nieves.&nbsp; I am grateful to all the wonderful staff in&nbsp;Parks, and to&nbsp;our labor partners particularly Laborers 483 who organized the Rangers and Recreation staff in addition to their staunch advocacy for maintenance workers.&nbsp; Thanks to the Parks Board and Parks Foundation staff and volunteers, too.&nbsp; The bureau depends on your leadership, support and advocacy.</p>
<p>My passion for Parks started long before I was elected as a City Commissioner, and was strengthened by my&nbsp;five+ years&nbsp;as Parks Commissioner.&nbsp;Portland's park system must be accessible to all. &nbsp;Being in charge of the Office of Equity and Human Rights will allow me to continue to pursue actions that will increase access for all Portlanders, in Parks and all other City bureaus. With Commissioner Nick Fish the next Parks Commissioner, I know that Parks will be left in good hands.&nbsp; He has been a strong Parks supporter throughout my time as Parks Commissioner, and I am confident that the work we have started will continue under his leadership. I will of course continue to advocate for Parks, and I know community members and staff will continue to do so too. &nbsp;Portland&rsquo;s parks depend on you!</p>

<p>My heart is heavy. My mind is cloudy. My physical reactions are unfamiliar to me.</p>
<p>I recall being in the middle of teaching a lesson when my colleague ran into my classroom and said that the World Trade Center had been attacked. I remember looking at her in confusion and then stepping out of my classroom to watch the news coverage she had playing in her classroom. Disbelief and fear immediately sunk in, and I had to prepare myself for how I would answer questions not only for myself, but for the 30 teenagers waiting for me to return to the classroom.</p>
<p>I remember standing at my kitchen sink with tears rolling down my face as I listened to the news recount the tragic events that had just taken place at Sandy Hook Elementary School. At this time, my daughter was only in pre-school, but I remember an intense feeling of sadness and fear that washed over me as I envisioned having to send her through the doors of a school in only a couple of short years.</p>
<p>And I continued to experience this reaction as I watch domestic terrorism, racist acts, and hate crimes play out in this country and locally. I am sickened by the violent acts that have resulted in the death or injury of individuals in Portland and across the nation, and disheartened as I face the reality that it seems like for all the rhetoric we create and share that encourages honest conversations about the historical and current trauma of racism, the hate rhetoric only gets stronger.</p>
<p>I am tired of looking up articles and watching videos on how to talk to my children about mass shootings and gun violence. I don&rsquo;t want to sit at my desk and craft words such as these to express my anger and frustration for the myriad ways in which our country fails to address concerns that are not new or novel. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to think about whether I will take my family to outdoor events, concerned for our safety and unsure of what might happen in a crowd of people we don&rsquo;t know. I walk around in a heightened state of awareness and fear&mdash;my head turning sharply at the sound of a loud scream or voice; my defenses activated when I go to unfamiliar spaces where my face is the only face of color in a sea of white.</p>
<p>The common thread in all these experiences? Terrorism. Terrorism against people, histories, ideologies, identities, ways of knowing and being.</p>
<p>As we continue to reel from last week&rsquo;s domestic terrorist attacks, we now must prepare for another assault on our city by White Nationalists this weekend. The best way to be safe this Saturday is to stay away from the rally. If you choose to show up, do not go alone. Stay with a group or go with at least one other person and decide on a meeting place in advance in case you get separated. If you experience or witness a hate or bias incident, report it to Portland United Against Hate at <a title=""Link to Portland United Against Hate"" href=""https://sites.google.com/view/portland-tracks-hate/home"">ReportHatePDX.com</a>. You may report confidentially. If you are stopped by law enforcement, be polite and follow instructions. Do not challenge police at the scene of the protest. If you feel your rights have been violated, you can address that afterward.</p>
<p>Some Portlanders ask, &ldquo;How could this continue to happen in our progressive city?&rdquo; The truth is that our long history of oppression against Black people, Indigenous People, and people of color allows this to happen. Institutional racism is the foundation that allows this to happen.</p>
<p>For years, communities of color in Portland have organized for government to respond to institutional racism. That community activism led to the creation of the Office of Equity and Human Rights which focuses on institutionalizing equity throughout City bureaus' policies, practices, and procedures. It takes time to change hundreds of years of history inside government, but Portlanders can help combat institutional racism by getting involved with local government advisory boards, connecting with social justice organizations, and listening to people of color and elevating conversations about racism and White Supremacy. <strong>We&rsquo;re all in this together.</strong></p>
<p>I will leave you with the words of the late Toni Morrison which seem fitting as we explore the current state of our political and social affairs:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The function, the very serious function of racism is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining, over and over again, your reason for being. Somebody says you have no language and you spend twenty years proving that you do. Somebody says your head isn&rsquo;t shaped properly so you have scientists working on the fact that it is. Somebody says you have no art, so you dredge that up. Somebody says you have no kingdoms, so you dredge that up. None of this is necessary. There will always be one more thing.&rdquo;</em></p>","https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oehr/article/739817",
"News",754396,"City of Portland Language List and Guidance",1,"","2020-02-25 18:51:46 UTC","2020-02-25 17:53:00 UTC","A","Factor 1 Analysis","<h2>I. Background</h2>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Factor 1 analysis and City of Portland Languages List</span></h3>
<p>As Portland continues to diversify, it is becoming home to a significant number of people who are multilingual and multicultural and have limited proficiency in speaking and/or reading English. As a City that is committed to equity and needs to work for everyone, it is imperative that appropriate support be provided to this segment of the population. However, the native languages spoken by these groups differ and Factor 1 analysis is the tool that helps draw a list of various languages and prioritize language services to Portland residents who have limited proficiency in English.</p>
<p>A Factor 1 analysis involves assessing the number or proportion of LEP (Limited English Proficiency) persons by language group eligible to be served by a program, activity, or service. It covers the entire city of Portland service area. The analysis uses demographic data from the five-year American Community Survey and the Oregon Department of Education school enrollment data for school districts in Portland. Further, the analysis helps develop the safe harbor language list. The non-English language groups qualify for the safe harbor provision by having an LEP population of 1,000 people or more within the Portland service area. The analysis also helps generate spatial distribution of LEP population in the City which in turn will serve as citywide equity tools. The current set of Factor 1 analysis maps are housed in CGIS and will be accessible through the Office of Equity &amp; Human Rights&rsquo; Language Access webpage. This analysis is conducted approximately every three years. The next analysis will be conducted Spring 2021 when the census releases its decennial data.</p>
<p>To use plain language, the list will now be referred to as the City of Portland Languages List instead of using the legal terminology. The City of Portland Languages List was previously referred to as the Safe Harbor Language List.</p>
<h3>What does &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; mean?</h3>
<p>Safe harbor&nbsp;refers to a legal provision to reduce or eliminate liability in certain situations if certain conditions are met.</p>
<h3>What does &ldquo;Limited English Proficiency&rdquo; (LEP) mean?</h3>
<p>Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refers to &ldquo;Individuals who do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English can be limited English proficient, or ""LEP."" These individuals may be entitled language assistance with respect to a particular type of service, benefit, or encounter.&rdquo; (Source: lep.gov)</p>
<p>LEP individuals are community members who often are multilingual and may be English language learners. An LEP individual may be able to communicate in English to a certain degree or in certain circumstances depending on the topic/vocabulary, but have the civil right, in accordance with Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964 &amp; E.O. 13166, to request access to information, services, and programs in their preferred language, from the City, free of cost. Language proficiency is a spectrum. For example, a multilingual individual may prefer to read in their language of preference when receiving pertinent information, i.e.&nbsp; communications with legal language and/or financial impacts.</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">II. City of Portland Language List</span></h2>
<p>The languages listed are languages spoken by approximately 1,000 or more Limited English Proficiency (LEP) individuals in the City of Portland service area: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Vietnamese</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Somali</li>
<li>Ukrainian</li>
<li>Romanian</li>
<li>Nepali</li>
<li>Chuukese</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional languages spoken by many of Portland&rsquo;s LEP community members (numbers did not reach the 1,000 threshold, but are important to note due to the number of community members who speak the language):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Tagalog</li>
<li>Laotian (Lao)</li>
<li>Arabic</li>
<li>Mon-Khmer Cambodian</li>
</ul>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">III. Guidance</span></h2>
<p>Please note that the City of Portland Language List is for the entire City service area and should be used for city-wide programs and services. Using the language list to determine language services is usually applied to translations (written), vital documents, and planned, non-requested, interpretation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The list is best employed for planning program and communication strategies particularly when we have undetermined language needs. It should be used to remove general barriers and anticipate and ensure access at the broadest level.</p>
<p>The service provided based on this list demonstrates proactive language services and simultaneously will be considered strong evidence of compliance with Title VI obligations.</p>
<p>Best practice includes defaulting to the top two to four languages at minimum when assessing which languages to translate vital documents or signage into or for providing proactive, planned interpreting for community engagement. In general, the top four languages rarely tend to change from assessment to assessment.</p>
<p>When a program or activity impacts a specific or smaller service area, best practice is to assess the language needs of the LEP populations in that area (a &ldquo;mini&rdquo; Factor 1 analysis). The results will help the bureau provide better and more targeted programs, services, and communications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an LEP individual requests language services you are not limited by the City of Portland Language List and should seek professional language services in the language requested by the member of the public.</p>
<h2>IV. Community Engagement</h2>
<p><strong>Conduct robust community engagement prior to, or in conjunction with, document translation.</strong></p>
<p>Community engagement is best practice in providing effective language access to multilingual community members. It is important to use community engagement best practices at key decision points instead of simply translating documents. In-person interactions such as engaging with the community at a meeting to disseminate information is often most effective and preferable to multilingual populations versus stacks of translated documents and fliers. A recommended language access resource for bureaus engaging with multilingual communities is the Community Engagement Liaisons (CELs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ensure culturally responsive engagement, partner with culturally and linguistically specific organizations, and community leaders to inquire how the communities prefer to be engaged with. Center community voice in your public engagement efforts in order to conduct equitable community engagement.</p>
<p>Robust community engagement includes research on behalf of the bureau to find out what languages community members speak in the service area served by the bureau&rsquo;s programs, services, and activities.</p>
<p>Effective, culturally and linguistically specific community engagement fosters trust between city government and immigrant/refugee communities (multilingual communities).</p>
<h2>V. Communication Path</h2>
<p>The most important consideration by the institution (City government) is to keep in the forefront that the &ldquo;end user&rdquo; is a community member. Consider the communication path that is being created by the institution (bureau/government). The communication path helps guide the institution in navigating the institution through the perspective of the LEP community. Communication path considerations at major decision points in planning, program and service design, communications, and policy design will help ensure the removal of barriers to government for LEP community members. Keep in mind the goal of the program, service, activity, communication, or policy, and follow the communication path to ensure institutional language access barriers are avoided, or, addressed and removed in order to provide equitable, meaningful access to achieve the intended outcomes and goals.</p>
<h2>VI. Cultural considerations</h2>
<p>Of course, there are many cultural considerations with regard to language access. There are many languages spoken in Portland which are indigenous languages and at present there are not many available language service providers that can fill those language requests. There should still be an effort to locate an interpreter or translator for the requested language. At times, using the commonly spoken language of the region could be an option in conjunction with a CEL (community engagement liaison) who may be able to speak the indigenous language (i.e. Spanish &amp; Maya). Another important consideration is oral versus written preference for communication of information. This will vary from culture to culture. For example, the Somali population largely prefers oral communication of information. Even when a cultural group is willing/able to receive written communication, at times the best way to reach a larger swath of the community is through oral communication disseminated at cultural hubs, with trusted community leaders. Other important considerations include historical distrust of government, mixed status households and fear of authorities, acculturation spectrum and intergenerational issues, intergroup complexities, etc. These are only some of many complex cultural considerations when examining language access. These considerations are important because they are some of the complex factors at play in community engagement between multilingual and multicultural communities and city government.</p>
<p>Language and culture are fluid. Language Access is a continuous quality improvement process and recognizes the ever-changing demographics of our community.<span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>

"News",759115,"Language Access Guidance for the COVID-19 Response",1,"","2020-04-15 19:44:11 UTC","2020-04-15 19:42:00 UTC","A","","<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s language access responsibilities fall under its obligation to ensure nondiscrimination on the basis of national origin per Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166.</p>
<p>The City of Portland is responsible for taking reasonable steps to provide equitable and meaningful access to it programs, services, activities, and communications to members of the public who have limited English proficiency and experience institutional language barriers.</p>
<p>Limited English proficiency (LEP) individuals are community members who often are multilingual and may be English language learners. An LEP individual may be able to communicate in English to a certain degree or in certain circumstances depending on the topic/vocabulary, but have the civil right, in accordance with Title VI, Civil Rights Act 1964 and E.O. 13166, to request access to information, services, and programs in their preferred language, from the City, free of cost.</p>
<p>City bureaus can take a proactive approach to meaningful engagement with limited English proficiency (LEP) communities by planning for language access needs. Bureau-initiated, pre-planned activities include translating information about a City program, service, or/and activity and disseminating materials appropriately; engaging LEP communities in the planning phase of new programs, services, activities, or projects.</p>
<p>Community engagement with culturally and linguistically specific community-based organizations and community leaders is vital when communicating about City programs, services, activities, and communications to multicultural communities whose primary language is not English.</p>
<p>Additionally, bureaus, and in this case, the Emergency Coordination Center and Joint Information Center, can take a proactive approach to access and engage in planned efforts for providing access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking is a measurable way to document and report on language access compliance activity. Providing meaningful access includes fulfilling public-initiated language access requests and can also be a result of proactive measures taken by City bureaus. Both types of language access measures should be tracked.</p>
<p><strong>Language Access Guidance for the Joint Information Center </strong></p>
<p>Assessing vital documents for translation into commonly encountered languages:</p>
<p>To determine what documents are vital documents, the impact and importance of the documents in communicating pertinent information to the community should be considered.</p>
<p>The following are the overarching criteria considerations a bureau should use when determining the bureau&rsquo;s vital documents:</p>
<p>Does the document have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety implications</li>
<li>Health implications</li>
<li>Legal implications</li>
<li>Financial impacts</li>
<li>Notices of rights and disciplinary action</li>
</ul>
<p>City bureaus will use the baseline vital document assessment criteria and determine its own additional criteria based on the programs, services, activities, and information it provides the community in English. During an emergency, assessment of vital documents is best achieved by working with linguistically specific community leaders and organizations who best understand the needs of the community. Additionally, an internal assessment using the above criteria in conjunction with community needs is best practice.</p>
<p>Providing meaningful access to limited English proficiency (LEP) community members takes into consideration that not all of the bureau&rsquo;s documents can be translated, and yet careful consideration must be given to the vital document assessment in order to ensure that LEP community members have equitable access to the bureau&rsquo;s/City&rsquo;s information in the same manner that the English-speaking community experiences.</p>
<p>When creating new content, it is advised to use plain language. Prior to sending out a document for translation, ensure that you have used the clearest language possible in English on your original document(s). By doing so, you ensure the translated document communicates your message clearly.<br /> Create content that:&nbsp; avoids jargon, doesn&rsquo;t cause text fatigue (too much text on the page), uses accessible info graphics when appropriate to convey a message. <a href=""https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/"">https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/</a></p>
<p>When listing languages on a webpage always list the language name in English and in the specific language. This is done so both English speakers (like city staff) and multilingual community members can identify the language on the page. Additionally, any link with a title that is a translated document should be titled in both languages (English and the translated language).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/oehr/article/754396"">Factor 1 and City of Portland Languages List and guidance <br /> </a>The languages listed in this assessment are for the City of Portland service area. There are many more languages spoken in our region, this list, as explained in the linked information, is derived from a federally mandated demographic assessment for the City of Portland service area.</p>
<p>The languages listed are languages spoken by approximately 1,000 or more Limited English Proficiency (LEP) individuals in the City of Portland service area: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Spanish</li>
<li>Vietnamese</li>
<li>Chinese</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Somali</li>
<li>Ukrainian</li>
<li>Romanian</li>
<li>Nepali</li>
<li>Chuukese</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional languages spoken by many of Portland&rsquo;s LEP community members (numbers did not reach the 1,000 threshold, but are important to note due to the number of community members who speak the language):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Tagalog</li>
<li>Laotian (Lao)</li>
<li>Arabic</li>
<li>Mon-Khmer Cambodian</li>
</ul>
<p>When possible, during an emergency, translating vital information into all the listed languages is recommended. At the very least, defaulting to the top four languages is recommended. Additionally, starting with the top four and then working on getting the information out in the rest of the languages listed can be a strategy to employ. When making this determination it is important to consider and take steps to ensure the City is not denying access to vital information for community members whose primary language is not English.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind that oral transmission of information is often the best method for reaching multicultural communities whose primary language is not English. Using culturally and linguistically specific media channels is an important method for reaching many communities. Ideally, all these efforts to communicate city information are paired with engagement with culturally and linguistically specific organizations and community leaders in order to most effectively reach those communities.</p>
<p>Contacting professional language service providers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Services: Translation &ndash; written and Interpretation- spoken (can be over the phone, in-person, and video)&nbsp;</p>
<p>For contracted language service providers - <a href=""/brfs/63023"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/brfs/index.cfm?andc=63023</a> (Requires staff log-in)</p>
<p>Additionally, language service providers who are already vendors with the city can be used, for example, IRCO (Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization).</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">Procurement Under Emergency Order: &ldquo;<em>When the Mayor or person designated to perform the duties of office of the Mayor (&ldquo;Designee&rdquo;), proclaims a State of Emergency or Disaster, the Mayor or Designee may, by direct appointment, award Emergency Procurement Contracts for the acquisition of goods, services, construction services and public improvements for the purpose of responding to the State of Emergency or Disaster.&rdquo; </em>City Code 5.33.135 </p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">If a language service provider is identified who is not already a vendor and can meet needs determined, contact procurement because they can grant approval of direct appointment contracts for the purpose of responding to the situation. <br /> <br /> <strong></strong></p>
<p class=""xmsonormal""><strong>Current situation</strong><br /> The Emergency Coordination Center is currently taking proactive steps to ensure multicultural and multilingual communities will have access to communications regarding the current COVID-19 situation. Measures are being taken to embed equity into all aspects of the operations in collaboration with the Office of Equity and Human Rights.</p>

<p>As in regular city operations, any city program, service, or activity that is public facing should ensure that the staff are trained on how to use and connect to a telephone interpreter in order to fulfill requests from the public for language assistance. It is the public&rsquo;s civil right to be provided with an interpreter free of cost.</p>
<p>All public-facing city documents must include a version of the <a href=""/oehr/71544"">meaningful access statement</a>. Please review the guidance on the Office of Equity and Human Rights&rsquo; Civil Rights page for the guidance and translated versions of the statement.

<h2><img class=""content-left"" title=""Photo of Dr. Markisha Smith"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=766488"" alt=""Photo of Dr. Markisha Smith"" width=""250"" height=""291.666666667"" />We the People? by Dr. Markisha Smith</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recent events in our City and across the country drew me to the Constitution&rsquo;s Preamble again. I found myself revisiting what was a steady part of my elementary school experience. In fact, as a graded assignment I remember having to memorize the Preamble and present it in front of the class. Because I was a diligent student, I completed the task without hesitation and earned an A. At this point in my development, I was not reflecting on the inherently white supremacist ideologies of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Less I forget the <em>School House Rock </em>series&mdash;videos of the Constitution and Preamble which presented a cartoon, catchy song version of information about the foundations of this country. I had no clue at the time that &ldquo;We the People&rdquo; was not talking about my people, Black people, and that the Bill of Rights was not created to be a set of rights that protected Black folx.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I watched as I drove along I-5 South the stream of trucks and cars with Trump and American flags whipping and flying in the air behind them. A feeling of anxiousness settled into the pit of my stomach as I thought about this moment in history we are experiencing and how the ideologies of the Preamble, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were and have been on full display for the world to see. The impending election has me concerned about how the outcome&mdash;either way&mdash;will encourage more opportunities for violence, harm, destruction, and death. I thought about how the Constitution is being used to justify acts of hate, injustice, white supremacy, and anti-Black racism. The words of the Constitution are being used to allow hate speech, acts of violence, and seemingly harmless flags to fly, which are in reality rooted in racism, to caravan across our city and create tension and discord&mdash;to incite destruction and slaughter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was for but a moment protests about the unforgivable, unforgettable murder of George Floyd and countless other Black folx across this country&mdash;the injustice Black folx experience in every facet of every system in this carefully designed, white supremacists framework, is now being soiled, tainted, usurped, caught up in a &ldquo;take over sprit&rdquo; meant to divided, deflect, and distract from the real focus-Black Life. Leaders note that Freedom of Speech, as part of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution is a right of Americans in this country. Yet, this freedom of speech permits hate speech and symbols of hatred towards Black folx that are a threat to our physical, mental, and emotional safety. Several of the other Amendments represent a similar unsafety for Black folx in this country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Amendment II</strong> permits Americans the freedom to bear weapons&mdash;gun violence at the hands of law enforcement officials towards Black folx plays out on our news and social media feeds frequently. And, white Americans have taken this constitutional right to mean policing their neighborhoods and shooting innocent Black people.</p>
<p>Rest in Power: Ahmed Aubrey and George Floyd</p>
<p><strong>Amendment IV</strong> protects people from unreasonable search and seizures-a &ldquo;no-knock&rdquo; warrant resulted in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor&mdash;Rest in Power</p>
<p><strong>Amendment X</strong> grants powers to the people not noted in the Constitution&mdash;while this seems to offer some cover for individuals at the state level, in reality neither the Constitution nor its amendments were created for the benefit of Black and Brown bodies in this country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word about police, policing, law enforcement, and the justice system. I do not sit here and pretend that I am proud of or impressed by how this system has worked for Black people in this country. In fact, I have watched it destroy individuals in my family, and even had personal experience with its failure to serve me as a survivor of domestic violence. Much of what I noted in the Amendments/Bill of Rights/Constitution has resulted in violations against and the death of Black people in America at the hands of law enforcement. And, while not every law enforcement agent is guilty of such violations or carries the blood of Black folx on their hands, there is an urgency to not only acknowledge how the system of policing has harmed Black folx but to be about the real business of how this system needs to be restructured to reflect the values and beliefs of the people it claims to serve.&nbsp; This does not mean that I am anti-police or that I do not recognize the fatigue and frustration that officers are experiencing, particularly in Portland, after over 100 days of demonstrations both peaceful and otherwise that have been taking place night after night. Yet, is it possible that we need to consider models of public safety that are designed by and for community in partnership with police agencies? Is it possible that we admit the system isn&rsquo;t broken, functions as it was intended to function, and commit ourselves to changing it to function in ways that also serve Black folx?</p>
<p>Here is another reality that we must all recognize. Black folx and other people of color are just as much contributors to white supremacists&rsquo; institutions as we are enemies against it. For every policy we want to abolish, there is some other policy that we supported, knowing full well it would not serve Black and Brown folks. Even at the tender of age of nine, I was being set up to digest the rhetoric of our &ldquo;founding fathers,&rdquo; and brainwashed to believe that the system would serve me in the same way they served my white classmates. Nope. Black folx must continue the re-programming process so that we embrace our true history and can use this history to shape our present and future.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions: Does this Constitution serve everyone in our country? And if not, why are we continuing to use it as a justification for racist, hate-filled acts of violence? Is this really democracy? Who is holding us accountable? The founding fathers are long gone&mdash;who has replaced them as the monitoring agent? And, does Black life matter enough to make us move bravely and boldly towards something different?</p>","https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oehr/article/766489",

<p>White supremacy takes no days off. And, through violent acts of hatred and trauma, it surfaces to remind us that we live in a country where being a person of color means that your life is not valued. To make matters worse, we are forced to watch the false, scapegoating excuses that seek to cover up the reality that racism is alive and thriving all around us.</p>
<p>I know many of you are reeling from the recent murders in Atlanta. I want to let you know that The Office of Equity and Human Rights and the City see our Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander employees and join you in mourning those whose lives were taken and in demanding a systemic response to hate crimes and violence.</p>
<p>Anti-Asian racism is nothing new in our society, but the surge in anti-Asian violence over the past year is a result, in part, of reckless and hateful speech and white supremacy. The Office of Equity condemns these acts of violence and encourages everyone to reach out to our Asian co-workers, neighbors, business owners, and families in support and solidarity.</p>
<p>At times like these we may feel helpless, but there are things we can do. Asian Americans Advancing Justice sponsors free Bystander Intervention Training and you can find out more <a href=""https://www.ihollaback.org/bystanderintervention/"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The DEEP program&rsquo;s Hapa Asian and Pacific Islander (HAPI) affinity group is a resource and safe space for AAPI employees to collectively mourn and discuss related topics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During these troubling times, employees have resources that may be able to help with anxiety and depression. The Racial Equity Support Line is 503-575-3764 and is staffed for and by people with lived experience of racism. They offer support to those who are feeling the emotional impacts of racist violence and microaggressions, as well as the emotional impacts of immigration struggles and other cross-cultural issues.</p>
<p>And finally, if there are ways that the Office of Equity and Human Rights can support you during this time, please do not hesitate to <a href=""mailto:oehr@portlandoregon.gov"">reach out</a>. We stand in solidarity and support of our Asian friends and family.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Floyd,</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were declarations that &ldquo;justice&rdquo; had been served in your name. Tears flowed and celebratory cries echoed in the air across America and the world.&nbsp; I, too, wept as my 10-year old daughter held me in her arms to offer me comfort. And, yet Mr. Floyd, I am reminded that Black folks have been worried, hesitant, filled with trepidation based on the uncertainly that this trial brought. I have talked with friends over the past month where sincere doubt and claims of &ldquo;They better get this right or this country is going to burn&rdquo; were the common sentiments. And, yet, here we are.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know you personally, but your story is the story of my father, uncles, brother, cousins, and son. Your story is not one of perfection but one of joys, pains, struggle, brilliance, and sacrifice. A story of striving to show up as your best self in spite of_____.&nbsp; Your story is etched in the experiences of Black men and young boys across this country who are consumed with fear each moment they step foot outside of inside spaces. Your story is tattooed on the hearts of Black women and young girls who carry anxious thoughts way down deep in the pit of their bellies about the ambiguous fate of the Black men they cherish. Your story is imprinted in the fabric of the Black community, an intricately woven tapestry of resilience, frustration, hope, distress, and love.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were declarations that &ldquo;justice&rdquo; had been served in your name. I would dare offer, Mr. Floyd, that what we saw yesterday was the beginning of a conversation about accountability.&nbsp; Accountability to policing and the justice system. Accountability for the hundreds of lost lives past, present, and unfortunately, I will say future.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the days before the verdict and in only moments before it was announced, a young Black man and woman lost their lives to acts of police violence. As we have continued to say your name over the past year, we now add Daunte Wright and Ma&rsquo;Khia Bryant to an exhaustive list of young Black brothers and sisters who will never see the light of day again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were declarations that &ldquo;justice&rdquo; had been served in your name.&nbsp; I would dare offer, Mr. Floyd, that what we saw yesterday was the beginning of a conversation about the nasty, persistent presence of white supremacy&mdash;the foundation of this country.&nbsp; White supremacy&rsquo;s foothold in our policing and justice system. What happens when we stand up against white supremacy and experience a rare instance where the outcome is in our favor.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>My prayer is that your family and friends find peace in this verdict. That this moment offers them some hope. &nbsp;That the people who love you and are committed to keeping your legacy alive experience moments of comfort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were declarations that &ldquo;justice&rdquo; had been served in your name. I would dare offer, Mr. Floyd, that what we saw yesterday was a call to action that acknowledges that anti-Black racism does indeed exist, and that Black life has and always will matter.</p>
<p>You should be alive; you should be with your family and friends living your life and doing the things that bring you joy. Stretching your arms towards the sky, closing your eyes, and feeling the warm sun on your beautiful brown skin. You should be teaching, hugging, and loving your children, lifting young Gianna on your shoulders to laugh and play. You deserved more time. We should not be speaking of you in the past tense. And, there should not be a collective mourning of your death and a glimmer of optimism in a verdict of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; on all counts. And, yet, here we are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the God of peace who moves in ways that are mysterious to us&mdash;who crafted our life story before we were even formed in our mothers' wombs&mdash;wrap us in light and love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your life and death were not in vain. You, my brother, are Black excellence.</p>
<p>Rest in Peace Mr. George Perry Floyd Jr.</p>","https://www.portlandoregon.gov/oehr/article/783131",

The celebration of Juneteenth Oregon began in 1945 when community leader Clara Peoples introduced the tradition from Muskogee, Oklahoma, to her co-workers at the Kaiser Shipyards in Portland.</p>
<p>Last year, City Council adopted an ordinance establishing June 19 as a formal day of remembrance and holiday to honor and recognize Black American history and the end of slavery in the United States. Since Juneteenth falls on a Saturday this year, the City paid holiday will be observed tomorrow. Multnomah County and Oregon have also designated Juneteenth as a holiday.</p>
<p>For a state that prohibited Black people from living here until 1926, we have come a long way, thanks to community members who protested and fought for racial equity and continue to speak truth to power for meaningful change. We have much more work to do, but having an official day for all of us to celebrate, grieve, listen, learn, engage, heal, and engage in self-care is a good start.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">I will personally honor Juneteenth by reading texts with my children that highlight the significance of Juneteenth.&nbsp; We will be reading: </span><a style=""font-size: 1.1em;"" href=""https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/494933152""><em>All Different Now: Juneteenth, the First Day of Freedom</em></a><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;""> and </span><a style=""font-size: 1.1em;"" href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-story-of-juneteenth-steven-otfinoski/1120341716""><em>The Story of Juneteenth: An Interactive History Adventure</em></a><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">.</span></p>
<p>I firmly believe that one way in which we honor the contributions of Black America is to educate our youth. Much of this history is either covered quickly, inaccurately, or not at all in schools. This year and for years to come, I am committing to ensuring my children engage with the story of their rich, vibrant, beautiful, resilient Black community. I encourage you to do the same. Share a story&mdash;share a resource&mdash;share the tremendous legacy of the Black experience in this country.&nbsp;</p>

"News",797213,"Farewell Letter from Dr. Markisha Webster",1,"","2021-11-18 19:09:35 UTC","2021-11-18 19:05:00 UTC","A","","<p><em><strong>Dr. Markisha Webster is joining the Sacramento Municipal Utility District as Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and shares this farewell message:</strong></em></p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" title=""Photo of Dr. Markisha Webster"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=797214"" alt=""Photo of Dr. Markisha Webster"" width=""250"" height=""355.59566787"" />Lately, I have been thinking about my life in junior high school. I believe the memories of this period in my life are flooding back to me now because I am watching my 11-year-old daughter struggle with all the things it means to be in middle school. I am reminded specifically of times when I would travel to Kings Island (an amusement park outside of Cincinnati, Ohio) with my closest friends. On one occasion I visited the park with my two best friends and somehow, who knows, I ended up also walking around the park with a boy I had a huge crush on. I remember being nervous and giddy, clearly awkward and trying wayyyyy too hard to be cool. I had a deep fear of roller coasters and had avoided them on all my previous visits to the park. On this day, however, with the love of my life walking around the park with me and the desire to &ldquo;fit in,&rdquo; I was convinced to get on the most treacherous coaster in the park. I think it had some name like &ldquo;Death Trap.&rdquo; I remember shaking as we waited in line, nervously laughing with my friends until it was our time to ride. I got in that seat with my heart thumping and a frozen smile on my face. I couldn&rsquo;t even truly enjoy that my crush had asked me to ride in the seat next to him because I was convinced this was it for me. There were a lot of screaming, tears, and silent prayers, it was not the ride of my life and I would never get on the ride again. And, to make matters worse, my new umbrella flew off the ride at some point when we were suspended in the air doing a loop-da-loop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I share this memory because it is a metaphor for life. I have often thrived on the predictable, on the practical, sprinkled in with a little adventure here and there. I much prefer the ease and predictability of a Ferris Wheel. There are no sharp turns or jarring moves. In fact, it is easy to take in the scenery around you and just enjoy the moment. You know where you are going and can take comfort in having a clear outcome. But this is NOT practical and is not the way life was intended to be.</p>
<p>I have quickly learned that there are moments in life when each of these rides beckons for your ticket.&nbsp; My work as an equity champion has situated me on some of the most dangerous, unpredictable rides of my life (see all of 2020 as a reference)&mdash;it has been a mix of Bumper Cars, the Screaming Eagle, and the Fun House with all the crazy mirrors. In these moments I am reminded that the work is challenging and absolutely worth it all at the same time. And, in other quiet moments, I have found myself on the Train or the Merry-Go-Round watching the fruits of my labor come to life and smiling with an incredible sense of pride.</p>
<p>I will say goodbye to my work and colleagues at the City of Portland this week. This departure is fraught with lots of emotions and in the moment as I write this, I feel like a 7<sup>th</sup> grader again&mdash;apprehensive, scared, expectant, and excited. My time at the City has served as a key part of my journey. I could never have imagined the support and love I have received during my time here. In fact, I would never have imaged how much I needed it during what was a critical transition point in my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>I could spend time rattling off a list of accomplishments during my time here or implore you to be a leader and/or co-conspirator in the fight for racial equity and social justice, but you&rsquo;ve heard a lot of that from me over the past 2 &frac12; years. Today, I would rather take the time to share some reflections that have guided and grounded me in recent times: &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It is not about the ride, it&rsquo;s about the journey.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Run towards your healing!</strong></p>
<p><strong>So much more can be accomplished when we listen to understand rather than listening to react. </strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Ask for what you want and be prepared to get it.&rdquo; (Maya Angelou)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.&rdquo; (Audre Lorde)</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If you are always trying to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be.&rdquo; (Maya Angelou)</strong></p>
<p>I wish you all light and love.&nbsp; I encourage you to not shy away from the scary roller coasters of life or to get too comfortable on those slow, moving rides in the kiddie area of the amusement park.&nbsp; I encourage you to go boldly and bravely into your purpose&mdash;knowing that whatever is on the other side was designed just for you.</p>
<p>&mdash;In solidarity and with the deepest gratitude, Dr. Markisha Webster</p>

<p>In December 2021, I accepted the challenge from Mayor Wheeler of serving as Interim Director for The Office of Equity and Human Rights. The opportunity to support and lead this team of passionate professionals is a truly humbling honor and thanks to our past directors, Dante J. James and Dr. Markisha Webster, we are able to continue forward with a strong foundation for the Office of Equity.</p>
<p>My overall goals for the transition are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support and coach the Office of Equity team so we can continue to institutionalize equity in City government on behalf of systemically excluded and institutionally oppressed Portlanders.</li>
<li>Continue to seek meaningful engagement with community to inform our work.</li>
<li>Assist Mayor Wheeler with hiring our next visionary director.</li>
<li>Set up the new director for success by handing off a highly motivated, more efficient, and more effective bureau.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there is always much more to accomplish, the Office of Equity experienced some accelerated movement in our work over the past two years, thanks to our growing capacity; community demand for City accountability around racial, disability, and LGBTQIA+ equity; and lessons learned from our major roles in the City&rsquo;s COVID-19 response. We will continue the momentum, build on our successes with urgency, and continue to listen and learn from community.</p>
<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have questions, comments, or feedback.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />Jeff Selby</p>
