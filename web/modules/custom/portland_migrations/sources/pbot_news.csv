News,514230,Traffic Advisory: Street improvements to close lanes on SW Madison Street next to City Hall Jan. 12-19,1,,2015-01-15 20:35:25 UTC,2015-01-05 22:14:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Update: the lane closures will be extended through mid-day January 20, and there will be no parking on SW Madison Street until all lanes reopen. &nbsp; This extension became necessary after crews unexpectedly needed to replace a storm drain and some sewer pipe. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>(January 5, 2015) - The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation&nbsp;advises the traveling public that street improvements will close the right eastbound lanes and bus stop on SW Madison Street between SW Fourth and Fifth avenues next to City Hall for seven days in early January.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lane closures will be in effect all hours and all days from Monday, January 12 through Monday, January 19, 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The lane closures are necessary to allow crews to repair the failed road base at the southwest corner bus stop and replace the asphalt with a stronger concrete surface. The concrete will need up to five days to cure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to carrying traffic within downtown, the street feeds motor vehicle, bus and bicycle traffic onto the Hawthorne Bridge.&nbsp; Travelers are advised to expect delays and use alternate routes if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Transit customers</strong>: During the project, the bus stop will be closed. The nearest alternate bus stops are on the transit mall and on SW Madison Street and First Avenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Drivers and bicycles</strong>: The parking lane on SW Madison Street will be converted into a travel lane and will be the sole travel lane for at least the first two days of the project. Crews will open up the center lane if possible during the latter part of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimize delays, work crews will adjust the lane closures if possible as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>After 3 p.m. and before 7 a.m., when crews are not at work, PBOT crews will widen the traveling lanes so bicycle riders can ride adjacent to motor vehicles instead of sharing one lane. &nbsp;During other hours, all vehicles will share the one travel lane.</li>
<li>Once the concrete bus pad is poured and while it is curing, crews will plan to open a second lane for the traveling public. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;In addition, parking will be removed from SW 4<sup>th</sup> Avenue in front of City Hall. &nbsp;Disabled parking will remain open for use on that block.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all work zone signage, and use alternate routes if possible.&nbsp; This work is weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>

News,514410,7 Tips for preventing bike theft,1,,2015-02-26 22:06:51 UTC,2015-01-07 22:01:00 UTC,A,Keep your bike and components safe with these essential steps,"<p>(January 7, 2015) Bike theft is getting a lot of attention recently - and with good reason. Bike theft is a deterrent for people riding bicycles and we want to keep people on their bikes and protecting their investments. Below are seven essential tips for keeping your bike safe. There is also a <a href=""/transportation/article/512857"">handy card you can download</a> that shows the best way to lock your bike and a place to write down your serial number for recovering a stolen bike. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href=""/transportation/article/520586""><img class=""content-right"" title=""bike theft card"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=520592"" alt=""bike theft card"" width=""350"" height=""265.332926084"" /></a>1. Always use a U-lock. Never use only a cable lock.</h3>
<h3>2. Lock your wheel and frame together (see card for example).&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>3. Use a bike rack (sign poles are not as secure).</h3>
<h3>4. When possible, do not park your bike on the sidewalk or street overnight.</h3>
<h3>5. Lock your bike in a well-lit and well-traveled area.</h3>
<h3>6. Take lights and other easily removed items with you.</h3>
<h3>7. Write down your serial number. It's the best piece of information you can have to recover your stolen bike. (<a href=""/transportation/article/512857"">Download the card</a> for more information).</h3>
<p>While our 7 tips are short and sweet, we do want to expand on a few of them. For example, we understand that not everyone has bike storage in their homes and that parking in public (Tip #4) or open places may be the only option. City bike racks are designed for short-term uses, such as going out to eat or visiting a friend. If you do not have more secure bike parking available, we suggest talking with your neighbors and property manager about creating a secure parking area. City building codes require all new multi-family (apartment) and commercial buildings (e.g. office) to have long-term bike parking facilities that are more secure than public racks and are weather protected. However, many buildings were constructed before building codes required bike parking. This leaves a gap in bike parking for many people. However, property managers may be responsive to tenants requesting essential services as part of their leases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our last tip (#7) does not actually help prevent bike theft, but does allow you to claim a bike that the police have recovered. Proof of ownership is essential for getting your stolen bike back. Your serial number and a picture of your bike are your two best preventative measures. An original receipt, if you bought the bike new, is also very useful.</p>

<p>THURSDAY, JAN. 15, 2015 PRESS RELEASE</p>
<p>PORTLAND TRANSPORTATION LEADERS PAUSE STREET FUND VOTE AS LEGISLATURE CRAFTS TRANSPORTATION BILL</p>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &ndash; Portland Mayor Charlie Hales and Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick today temporarily halted the paperwork necessary to take an advisory vote to the May ballot, regarding options to pay for city street maintenance and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, I am announcing a pause in our local efforts to fund our streets and safety projects within the City of Portland,&rdquo; Mayor Hales said. &ldquo;Over the past week, I have had conversations with Speaker of the House Tina Kotek and with Gov. John Kitzhaber. They have each assured me that a statewide transportation package is a top priority for them this legislative session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Legislature is set to convene in February. The deadline for Portland to submit paperwork for the May election was 5 p.m. today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they recognize the importance of efforts to fund transportation infrastructure, they will hear the needs of local governments and ensure they are part of state transportation conversations as they work to give communities the tools to build and maintain critical infrastructure,&rdquo; Hales said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to know that the Legislature is very interested in a transportation funding discussion this year,&rdquo; Commissioner Novick said. &ldquo;We have said all along that the street fund we have proposed will not address all our needs, and that we are counting on the state and federal governments to step up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city has conducted more than 14 months of hearings to craft a proposal to pay for street maintenance and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the passionate conversations we have had in Portland regarding transportation funding, many options were discussed, none of which prove to be popular,&rdquo; Hales said. 2</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some options were put forward by Portlanders that we do not have the authority to enact. As your mayor, I will go to Salem to seek that authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hales said he also will enlist the aid of mayors throughout Oregon to push for more authority for cities. &ldquo;Together, we can represent the needs of cities, all of which will benefit from new options to fund infrastructure at a time when the existing options don&rsquo;t satisfy our communities,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The completion of this work comes when all three levels of government have acted; when Congress, the Legislature and the Portland City Council have all authorized new revenues to pay for streets and roads,&rdquo; Hales said. &ldquo;This cooperation between the State of Oregon and local governments gives us, as Oregonians, the best way forward toward that objective.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enforcement action will be from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the marked crossing on SW Capitol Highway at SW Miles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This location was chosen at the request of the community, which has been active in educating and encouraging drivers to be alert, aware and slow down. &nbsp;&nbsp;The crossing is heavily used by school children and transit riders - a pre-school is on one corner and the crossing also supports two TriMet stops and is close to a public school bus pickup and drop off location on SW Miles.</p>
<p>A crosswalk enforcement action includes a pedestrian decoy positioned at marked or unmarked crosswalks. These actions are designed to inform the public of longstanding Oregon crosswalk laws and to improve pedestrian safety. &nbsp;Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who jaywalk may be issued a warning or citation by the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Crosswalk enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus do enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

Tell us where better local streets and pathways are needed and why. We want to hear what you would like to see improved and what should be preserved.</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and the Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) are working together on the <a href=""/transportation/65574"">Tryon-Stephens Headwaters Neighborhood Street Plan</a>. The objective of the street plan is to establish a more connected local street and pathway network and to improve stormwater management systems within the area.</p>
<p>This area has steep slopes, soil that does a poor job of absorbing rain and sensitive natural resources.&nbsp; All these factors require an integrated approach to street and stormwater improvements. In addition to coordinating PBOT and BES investments in the project area and aligning transportation and stormwater system needs with community priorities, the Tryon-Stephens Headwater Neighborhood Street Plan will:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a strategy to improve local street connectivity and access to important neighborhood destinations, and </strong></li>
<li><strong>Define the primary walking and bicycle networks in the area</strong></li>

<p>(February 5, 2015) &nbsp;Did you know that 9-Powell and 4-Division are among the regions busiest bus lines? They&rsquo;re considered the workhorses of the eastside TriMet bus system.</p>
<p>Metro, TriMet, ODOT, Multnomah County and the cities of Portland and Gresham are looking into a range of options to improve transit service along these routes. A new kind of service, called Bus Rapid Transit, is being considered to improve convenience beyond today&rsquo;s Frequent Service.</p>
<p>Bus Rapid Transit is basically a mix of vehicle, station and street features knit together to create faster, more reliable trips with better service. Think of blending rubber tire buses with some of the key benefits of streetcar and light rail. Different types of vehicles, stations and station amenities as well as route alignment are all on the table. We&rsquo;ll also be looking at ways to improve walking and biking access along the route.</p>
<p>We need your help to bring better service to this important transit corridor. Please join us for one or all of the workshop/open houses below, or at one of the drop-in sessions:</p>

News,518537,News Release: Director Leah Treat rolls out Portland Progress; 2-year work plan for PBOT that sets practical and audacious goals,1,,2015-02-10 18:20:17 UTC,2015-02-10 18:17:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(February 10, 2015) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation leadership today released <a href=""/transportation/workplan"">Portland Progress,</a> a two-year work plan that highlights new initiatives affecting all aspects of bureau operations and sets the agency&rsquo;s sights on serving Portlanders&rsquo; core values of quality of life, safety, health and economic wellbeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PBOT has long stood out among much larger cities for our expansive vision of transportation as a catalyst for economic development, environmental sustainability and social equity,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, the transportation bureau&rsquo;s director. &ldquo;This work plan continues in that tradition and is a fitting challenge for a staff that is consistently hard-working, resourceful and forward-looking.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Progress comes in two parts, the first focused on external actions to improve Portland&rsquo;s transportation system, the second on strengthening the organization itself so it can better serve the public. Both parts are published online at <a href=""/transportation/workplan"">www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/workplan</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While ambitious in goals, the work plan is realistic about finances and the resources available to PBOT.&nbsp; The work plan specifically calls out the budget cuts of recent years that have taken a toll on the bureau and the city&rsquo;s transportation system.&nbsp; It outlines approaches and actions that can be taken with existing resources and scaled up as new revenue becomes available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are laying out a bold and audacious vision for what our transportation future can be - a city of zero traffic fatalities, with streets and systems that are the envy of the nation, an inclusive city where every resident and business has the opportunity to grow and thrive, and a sustainable place that supports the health of both our people and our planet,&rdquo; Treat added.</p>
<p>Portland Progress action items are informed first by the multiple long-range plans that guide all city agencies: the Portland Plan, the Comprehensive Plan, Climate Action Plan and, specifically to this bureau, the Transportation System Plan. It was further developed through input and meetings with partner agencies, stakeholders and employee focus groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is a plan with 176 ambitious and actionable steps that are grouped into six themes. Five are focused on serving the public. The sixth theme, <a href=""/transportation/66470"">Shoring Up the Foundation</a>, focuses on the people of PBOT and improved internal operations.</p>
<p>Portland Progress is intended to be a living document for use internally as well as in the community.&nbsp; PBOT also commits to reporting on its progress through an online performance meter and periodic updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is amply illustrated and includes graphics and other resources that can be excerpted and used as needed. These include a &ldquo;Safe Speed&rdquo; graphic that shows the effect of different speeds on the likelihood of a person surviving a crash, and maps of annexation, diversity and unpaved streets.</p>
<p>Portland Progress also summarizes the city&rsquo;s transportation history, showing how the city and its transportation choices have evolved over the years, from early days that includes a streetcar system to the age of the automobile to current times in which the public and bureau are striving for a more balanced system that raises the role of walking, biking and transit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to build a better Portland together,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;We will be ambitious, and we will be accountable. We will move forward quickly and efficiently within two years to make this plan a reality, and after two years we will continue to build on this plan and build on our progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The board approved permits that were requested by six of the seven taxi companies that do business in Portland. The board also recommended City Council approval of 51 permits for a new taxi company, Ecocab, which plans to offer service with a fleet comprised of all-electric vehicles.</p>
<p>""We hear from the public that they want taxis to be more accessible, and we hope these new permits will make it easier for everyone to be able to take a cab when they want one,"" said Leah Treat, Director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>

<p>The board required that the first vehicles added to the fleets of the existing companies be wheelchair accessible. The City requires that each taxi company ensure that 20 percent of its fleet is accessible to people with disabilities. If the City Council approves Ecocab and the 51 permits recommended, the total number of taxis permitted in Portland would grow from 460 currently approved to 753.</p>
<p>The change comes as PBOT conducts a top-to-bottom review of the City&rsquo;s regulations for taxis, limos, town cars and other services, which are regulated by the Private for Hire Transportation (PFHT) Division. The City Council moved the division from the Revenue Bureau to PBOT effective July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>New dispatch software has identified times during which there is a significant shortage of taxi vehicles available to serve the public during periods of peak demand.</p>
<p>Initial reports in 2014 indicated that during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, there was an approximate 90 percent availability of Broadway and Radio cabs requested through their contracted smartphone application, called Curb.</p>
<p>On weekends, that percentage drops to 60 percent and lower. For instance, on Saturday, Oct. 25, between 2 and 3 a.m., 206 requests for rides were made to Broadway Cab and Radio Cab through Curb, but only 50 of those requests were fulfilled.</p>

<p>The City of Portland Sunday Parkways presented by Kaiser Permanente season begins on Mother&rsquo;s Day in outer Southeast Portland and finishes in September with the Tilikum Crossing/Sellwood event.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways is a series of free community events opening the city's largest public space &ndash; its streets &ndash; for people to walk, bike, roll and discover active transportation.&nbsp; The events are hugely popular; total attendance topped 100,000 last year.</p>
<p>This year, organizers are emphasizing ways people can create the Sunday Parkways experience every day. All five Sunday Parkways routes showcase low-traffic streets called &lsquo;neighborhood greenways&rsquo; as well as City parks that people can enjoy all year long for their own bicycling and walking trips. &nbsp;The TilikumCrossing/Sellwood route will introduce participants to new bicycling, walking and transit improvements being made by the City and partners along the new light rail corridor that opens in September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day can be Sunday Parkways for thousands of Portlanders when we provide safe routes for people to bike and walk,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea that every day can be Sunday Parkways supports what we recommend to patients - incorporate activity into your daily life by walking your kids to school, taking a short stroll during lunch, or taking your dog for a walk,&rdquo; said Dr. Timothy Jacobson, cardiologist with Kaiser Permanente. &ldquo;Most importantly, find something - like biking - that you enjoy, and you'll be more likely to stick with it, especially if you have support from a family member or friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""content-center"">The dates and locations for Sunday Parkways 2015 are as follows:</p>
<p class=""content-center"">East Portland Sunday Parkways<br />May 10, Mother&rsquo;s Day ~ 11am-4pm (7 miles)<br /><br />North Portland Sunday Parkways<br />June 21, Father&rsquo;s Day ~ 11am-4pm (9.5 miles)<br /><br />Northeast Portland Sunday Parkways<br />July 26 ~ 11am-4pm (8 miles)<br /><br />Southeast Portland Sunday Parkways<br />August 23&nbsp; ~ 11am-4pm (7 miles)<br /><br />Tilikum Crossing/Sellwood Portland Sunday Parkways<br />September 27 ~ 11am-4pm (8.5 miles)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Sunday Parkways has become a beloved event series in Portland with strong community support,&rdquo; Transportation Director Leah Treat said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/58929""><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=519216"" alt=""Map of 2015 Sunday Parkways routes"" width=""380"" height=""380"" /></a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I particularly want to call out Kaiser Permanente, our presenting sponsor, as well as new partners AAA Oregon/Idaho&nbsp;and Umpqua Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Residents and visitors say they come to enjoy the traffic-free streets connecting parks and schools filled with activities, music and vendors. It&rsquo;s safe, family-friendly and a chance to meet neighbors.</p>
<p>Community groups and vendors wanting to participate in Sunday Parkways &ndash; and volunteers who want to help make it happen &ndash; are encouraged to contact the transportation bureau at 503-823-7599 or online at PortlandSundayParkways.org.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sunday Parkways is organized by the Portland Bureau of Transportation with longtime presenting sponsor Kaiser Permanente and returning partners/sponsors Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Clif Kid, Bike Gallery, Whole Foods, NW Natural, Car2Go, Metro and AARP of Oregon.</p>
<p>New partners for 2015 are AAA Oregon/Idaho, Umpqua Bank, Recology Portland&nbsp;and Spinlister. The City of Portland funds a third of the cost with two-thirds of funding coming from sponsors, vendors, and individual supporters.&nbsp;</p>

News,519777,News Advisory: Evening crosswalk enforcement action to highlight pedestrian safety Feb. 25 at SE Division Street and SE 31st Avenue,1,,2015-02-19 19:41:27 UTC,2015-02-19 19:35:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(February 19, 2015) -- The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau advise the traveling public that a crosswalk enforcement action is scheduled for the evening of Wednesday, February 25 to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and traffic law.</p>
<p>The enforcement action will take place from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the marked crossing on SE Division Street at SE 31<sup>st</sup> Avenue.</p>
<p>This crossing and others along this section of the newly redesigned SE Division Street corridor are heavily used by pedestrians accessing TriMet, retail shops, restaurants, residences, and other locations.&nbsp; The timing was chosen to highlight pedestrian safety during the busy evening hours.</p>
<p>The crosswalk enforcement action reinforces the safety improvements installed as part of the recently completed <a href=""/transportation/article/432332"">Division Streetscape Project</a>, a joint project between the transportation and environmental services bureaus.</p>
<p>A crosswalk enforcement action involves a pedestrian decoy who crosses the street at marked or unmarked crosswalks while police officers monitor the street for traffic violations. These actions are designed to inform the public of longstanding Oregon crosswalk laws and to improve pedestrian safety. &nbsp;Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who jaywalk may be issued a warning or citation by the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Crosswalk enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus conduct enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

News,521947,News Release: Legislature hears plea for safety cameras pilot program on Portland’s High Crash Corridors,1,,2015-03-10 01:04:16 UTC,2015-03-10 01:03:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(March 9, 2015) -- The House Transportation and Economic Development Committee heard testimony today on legislation that would authorize the City of Portland to create a pilot program for unmanned photo radar safety cameras on its urban High Crash Corridors.</p>
<p>The City of Portland is seeking this authority to combat the frequent serious and fatal crashes on these roadways, and to educate and encourage safer driving by the traveling public. The 10 designated High Crash Corridors make up just 3 percent of the City&rsquo;s road network, but they account for more than 50 percent of pedestrian fatalities in Portland.</p>
<p>House Bill 2621 is sponsored by Representative Jeff Reardon, whose district includes parts of East Portland that are crisscrossed by several High Crash Corridors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am deeply saddened by the number of traffic fatalities in East Portland each year,&rdquo; Rep. Reardon said. &ldquo;My hope is that House Bill 2621 will keep our community safe by reminding drivers that when they speed on these high-crash corridors, they put their neighbors' lives at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The committee heard testimony from Kristi Finney-Dunn, whose son was killed on SE Division Street, one of the streets where cameras could be placed if the bill passes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On August 12, 2011, my son Dustin was killed one of Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Corridors,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Since that day, I have been a traffic safety advocate, fighting for transportation safety measures like HB 2621 to save other families from the pain mine has suffered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Lee Turner, retired rehabilitation instructor for the Oregon Commission for the Blind, said cameras could improve safety by leading more motorists to follow the speed limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a lifelong legally-blind pedestrian in our community, it is increasingly critical that all people -- motorist, pedestrians, and cyclists -- using public roads know and abide by the laws. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m testifying in support of HB 2621, so that we have the greatest chance of safety for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT, said the cameras are an important safety measure the legislature should allow Portland to try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed kills. The likelihood that you will die if you are hit by a car is directly related to how fast the car is going,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;This is one tool that we can use to slow people down and reduce the number of traffic deaths and injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leah Treat, the Director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation, testified to the committee, sharing her commitment to eliminating serious and fatal crashes from city streets. At her direction, PBOT has adopted the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities, an approach known as Vision Zero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speeding is a top contributing factor to fatal crashes in Portland metro region, second only to DUII,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;Many cities, including Seattle to our north, and Chicago and Washington, D.C. where I served previously, are successfully using unmanned photo radar to curb dangerous speeding. I feel it is an important tool to change behavior, improve safety, and reduce fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; Drivers must stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when the pedestrian is in the motor lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>The SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and SE Cooper Street crossing has no paint lines at the crosswalk. It does have a pedestrian median island and signage to alert drivers to the possible presence of pedestrians in the crossing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southeast 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue is one of ten <a href=""/transportation/54892"">High Crash Corridors</a> that the transportation bureau has prioritized for stepped up education, enforcement and safety improvements.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.</p>
<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Sharon White will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during the first half of the action and a Portland police officer will serve that role during the second half.</p>
<p>Crosswalk enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus do enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you live or work within the city limits of Portland, chances are you have encountered our neighborhood anarchist.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules of the road are tossed aside at&nbsp;these crossroads of danger!&nbsp;&nbsp;Its a free-for-all&nbsp;for the right-of-way and&nbsp;the police are afraid of even&nbsp;uttering the&nbsp;name of&nbsp;this menace to society!&nbsp; Yes, my friends, I am talking about that scourge of our roadways, the uncontrolled intersection.</p>

<p>These lawless crossroads are missing a key element of our transportation nomenclature, the trusty stop sign.&nbsp; Everyone knows what to do at a stop sign - stop.&nbsp; And we all know what to do when that rosy octagon is absent - go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, uncontrolled intersections (<span class=""contentHeader""><span class=""contentHeaderDetail"">16.90.415&nbsp;-</span></span>&nbsp;<span class=""medium"">Any intersection with no official traffic control device to designate vehicular right-of-way) don't work that way.&nbsp; But how do they work?&nbsp; Who's supposed to stop?&nbsp; And why do they exist?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Theoretically, uncontrolled intersections do a better job slowing traffic in neighborhoods because they create unpredictability.&nbsp; When we can't rely on signs to tell us what to do, we have to actually use our senses and our brains to navigate a situation.&nbsp; Think of it this way: If you were biking or driving down a low-traffic neighborhood street and you hit a stop sign every 100 feet with no cross traffic in sight, by the sixth stop sign you might be tempted to ignore it and keep on rolling.&nbsp; Uncontrolled intersections mixed with stop signs keep people who are driving and bicycling alert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course theory doesn't always play out exactly as planned on the roadways.&nbsp; People (myself included when I moved here) often apply the ""main street"" theory to uncontrolled intersections.&nbsp; The main street theory says that since one vehicle is traveling on the main thoroughfare, it has the right-of-way.&nbsp; Sorry folks - that's not how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.odot.state.or.us/forms/dmv/37.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Driver's Manual</a> states,</p>
<p>At an intersection where there are no signs or signals, you must look and yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching from your right at the same time. (pg.41)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words: 1) Slow down. 2) Look for other vehicles (and, like&nbsp;always,&nbsp;pedestrians). 3) Yield to vehicles in the intersection or approaching from the right. 4) Go!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't let the uncontrolled intersection get you!</p>

<p>(March 23, 2015) A combination of new city codes, administrative rules and a pilot program could allow Uber, Lyft and other Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) to legally provide service in Portland in April.</p>
<p>The Private for Hire Transportation Innovation Task Force was convened in January to recommend updates to the City&rsquo;s private for-hire transportation safety regulations to include TNCs. The Task Force is on schedule to deliver its recommendations to the City Council on April 9 at 2 p.m. in City Council Chambers.</p>
<p>To implement the Task Force&rsquo;s recommendations and update taxi regulations in line with City Council direction, the Portland Bureau of Transportation will offer a combination of administrative rules and city code revisions, to initiate a TNC pilot program. During the 120-day pilot program, permits will be available for companies such as Uber and Lyft to operate legally in Portland.</p>
<p>The Task Force&rsquo;s work is divided into two phases. During phase 1, from January through April, the Task Force has focused on new rules for TNCs and taxis that the City could implement in a pilot program. During phase 2, from April through July, the Task Force will take a broader look at, and make recommendations for, permanent changes to all private for-hire transportation rules that regulate taxis, TNCs, limos, party buses, pedicabs and other private for-hire transportation operators.</p>
<p><em><strong>Upcoming key dates for Phase 1 new taxi cab regulations to keep up with strong demand for taxi service:</strong></em></p>

<p>After April, during Phase 2, the Task Force will continue to review and gather input on private for-hire regulations for all modes, including taxi companies, TNCs, limos, party buses, pedicabs and other private for-hire transportation operators. The Task Force will present any additional recommendations to City Council this summer at the conclusion of Phase 2.</p>
<p>The City Council and the Portland Bureau of Transportation have already taken action to address high demand for taxi service in Portland. On March 18, 2015the City Council approved permits for EcoCab Portland, LLC.,the first new taxi company to start business in Portland since Union Cab was approved for operation in 2012. In February, the City&rsquo;s Private for-Hire Transportation Board of Review approved 242 new taxi permits for existing taxi companies and recommended adding EcoCab with up to 51 permits.</p>
<p>Portland has a far lower rate of taxi availability than other U.S. cities of comparable size. According to a study by ECONorthwest, Portland had 7.5 taxis per 10,000 residents in 2013, the second-lowest among 10 cities in the study. Six of the 10 cities had taxis available at twice the rate as Portland.</p>

<p>The new signage is part of a years-long planning effort by the City and neighborhood residents and businesses to ease parking challenges and improve the livability and business vitality of the growing neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The<a href=""/transportation/60560""> newly expanded permit area</a> stretches from W Burnside Street to NW Vaughn Street and westward from NW 16<sup>th</sup> to NW 25th avenues<a href=""/transportation/60560"">.</a>&nbsp;Previously, Zone M&rsquo;s north boundary stopped at NW Irving Street. An adjacent parking permit area next to I-405, called Zone K, will remain unchanged.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=523802"" alt="""" width=""150"" height=""228"" /></p>
<p>Blocks with a Zone M sign will allow visitors to park for up to four hours, and allow neighborhood residents who have purchased $60 annual permits to park without those time restrictions.</p>
<p>PBOT crews begin sign installation this week and are expected to complete all signage within two weeks. The permit rules take effect on each block as signs are installed. Enforcement hours are 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday. &nbsp;Sunday and holiday parking are not affected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new signs mark an important milestone in a collaborative effort between the neighborhood and the city to alleviate parking congestion and frustration,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, Portland Bureau of Transportation director. &ldquo;Visitors and residents will now have an easier time finding parking and businesses will benefit from improved access by their customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The $60 annual permits are available to people who live, work or own property within the Zone M boundaries. More than 2,000 permits for the expanded zone have been issued since they became available in February. Notices have been mailed to all residents and businesses in the area and several outreach events also have been held.</p>
<p>The Northwest Parking Plan, passed by City Council in 2013, also calls for parking meters to be installed on the commercial corridors of NW 21<sup>st</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup> avenues and some surrounding streets. Those are scheduled to be installed in late spring and will have time limits of two and four hours at a price of $1.60 per hour.</p>

For updates on bridge construction, check <a href=""http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/constupdates.php"" target=""_blank"">PortlandStreetcar.org</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's a commuter to do? If you're on transit sit back and relax, TriMet's got it all figured out for you.&nbsp; If you're driving, you're on the Fremont or one of the arterial bridges to the south.&nbsp; But what if you're walking or biking?</p>

<p>When you're on foot or two wheels a detour is more than an inconvenience, it can be a major roadblock (pun intended, zing!) for your commute.&nbsp; Luckily we've got several good bridge options for you to get back and forth across the ol' Willamette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Steel Bridge - Official signed <a href=""http://portlandstreetcar.org/pdf_maps/broadway_bridge_bikeped_detours_001.pdf"" target=""_blank"">alternate route</a><br /></strong></p>
<p>How nice is the lower deck of the Steel Bridge for walking and biking?&nbsp; Love it!&nbsp; It does tend to get crowded on beautiful summer afternoons at commute times, but the view is worth a little congestion.&nbsp; On the east side the Steel Bridge gives you easy access to N Interstate Ave, the Rose Quarter Transit Center, Oregon Convention Center, and Broadway, Weidler, and Tillamook - three major east/west bike connections.&nbsp; On the west side the terminus is the north end of Tom McCall Waterfront Path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Morrison Bridge NEW Multi-use Path</strong></p>
<p>The Morrison has a brand spanking new bicycle and pedestrian path.&nbsp; It's wide, smooth, and (so far) lightly used.&nbsp; Access the path on the east side at SE Water and SE Yamhill.&nbsp; On the west side human-powered commuters can hop on by heading east on Alder or just off Naito Pkwy at Morrison St.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the path is new, not nearly as many people use it as the Steel Bridge.&nbsp; <a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=45.52463,-122.671623&amp;spn=0.027782,0.055189&amp;z=14&amp;msid=107620698926668506866.00048b4b7bfba4acf2ceb"" target=""_blank"">Check it out</a>!&nbsp; It's a quiet, peaceful ride.</p>

The shop celebrated its Grand Opening with a free Bike Repair Workshop last night at the Rosewood Initiative Community Center at 16126 SE Stark.</p>
<p>While there are more than 70 <a href=""/transportation/article/71973"">bike shops</a> in bike-passionate Portland, shops and services are scarce in East Portland. &nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to last night there were no bicycle shops east of 106<sup>th</sup> Avenue, which meant a Rosewood resident with a flat tire would have to travel <strong>4 miles</strong> to reach the closest shop.</p>
<p>Rosewood Bikes is making its temporary home inside the Rosewood Initiative Community Center and hopes to find a permanent location by mid- to late-summer. The non-profit bike shop and advocacy organization will offer weekly fix-it nights on Thursdays from 4 to 6 pm. &nbsp;Director Matt Martin hopes Rosewood Bikes can be part of a growing movement to make East Portland more bike friendly, especially for the families and bicyclists of all ages and types that live in the area.</p>

<p>One of the ways we&rsquo;ve been able to achieve this is because Portlanders are driving less. Yet transportation of goods and people still accounts for nearly 40 percent of Multnomah County carbon emissions. How we move around makes a difference, and land use patterns make a difference on how we move around.</p>
<p>Portland was the first U.S. city to adopt a plan to cut carbon in 1993. That plan put Portland and Multnomah County on a path to reach a 40 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 (based on 1990 levels). The 2015 draft Climate Action Plan builds on accomplishments to date with ambitious policies, new research and engagement with underserved communities.</p>
<p>According to the plan, 60 percent of Portlanders are currently being served by &ldquo;healthy connected neighborhoods&rdquo; that support the health and well-being of residents. Healthy connected neighborhoods afford people of all ages and abilities safe and convenient access to the goods and services needed in daily life &ndash; grocery stores, schools, libraries, parks, and jobs &ndash; reachable by foot, bike or transit. Forty percent of Portlanders still live in neighborhoods that lack safe and convenient access to transit, commercial services, jobs, or in many areas such as East Portland, even sidewalks. Addressing this inequity is one important piece of the plan.</p>
<p>The draft 2015 Climate Action Plan has been released for public comment and can be viewed here - <a href=""/bps/49989"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/49989</a>. Public comments are due by April 10.</p>

News,525337,"News Release: PBOT to clear abandoned publication boxes; offer new ways to free up sidewalk space, tidy up publication boxes",1,,2015-04-08 16:46:46 UTC,2015-04-07 20:11:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(April&nbsp;8, 2015) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation this month is beginning to clear sidewalks of abandoned publication boxes as part of a larger program - shaped with input from local media outlets, neighborhoods and businesses - to improve maintenance of boxes in the public right of way.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=525335"" alt=""Abandoned publication box"" width=""250"" height=""334"" />The new rules, adopted by the City Council earlier this year, help clean up public sidewalks for better pedestrian access and the beauty of the public right-of-way, while maintaining availability of publications. These major changes&nbsp;are being implemented on&nbsp;city streets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Abandoned publication boxes:&nbsp;</strong>The new rules give Transportation Bureau staff the authority to remove empty boxes that have become a public nuisance. Crews will tag those boxes with a 30-day sticker, remove them after that time period, and recycle or dispose of them after 90 days, if not reclaimed. The public is encouraged to report abandoned boxes via <a href=""mailto:publicationboxes@portlandoregon.gov"">publicationboxes@portlandoregon.gov</a> or 503-823-3467.</li>
<li><strong>Clean and tidy freestanding boxes:&nbsp;</strong>Publication boxes that are in operation must be clean, free of graffiti, in good working order and be placed in a way that doesn&rsquo;t impede pedestrians. Media outlets will have until July 1 to adjust and comply with the new regulations.</li>
<li><strong>New, co-located publication boxes: </strong>Eleven co-located boxes are being added to Portland sidewalks, expanding a 2012 pilot program that introduced four such structures around Pioneer Courthouse Square.The co-located boxes can house multiple publications in a single metal box, saving valuable sidewalk space and offering an organized appearance to public space. Neighborhood associations and business districts may apply for a co-located publication box in their area to create a central area for dispersing several publications.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Streets and sidewalks are shared community spaces that Portlanders love, but they must be maintained,&rdquo; Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;This new program gives the public a new way to alert us when they see problem publication boxes and it empowers PBOT staff to help address problem areas more effectively. We are inspired by the pride Portlanders take in their public spaces and we are eager to support community initiatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=525341"" alt=""New co-located publication box at City Hall"" width=""300"" height=""216"" />The program stems from months of discussions with PBOT staff, publication leaders and local neighborhood and business associations. Recommendations from a stakeholder committee led City Council to change City Code to address regulations for publication boxes in the right-of-way while still protecting the freedom of expression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland City Council amended City Code 17.46 in January, expanding the code for publication boxes from the downtown mall to citywide. The new standards took effect in February.&nbsp; For additional information, visit <a href=""/transportation/publicationbox"">www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/publicationbox</a>.</p>

Neighborhood Greenways are low-speed, low-traffic streets where people walking and bicycling are prioritized over cut-through automotive traffic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=526283"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""187"" /></p>
<p>PBOT has nearly 80 miles of Neighborhood&nbsp;Greenways in all parts of the city. While the program has changed since it first emerged as a citizen-led effort to identify SE Salmon and SE Taylor as a designated bicycle route, Neighborhood Greenways share several characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Automotive speeds are low. In most cases the signed speed limit is 20 MPH.</li>
<li>Automotive volumes are low. PBOT strives for less than an average of 1,500 cars per day and many Neighborhood Greenways have less than 1,000 cars per day.</li>
<li>Crossings of major streets are improved for people walking and bicycling across.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>The new signs help provide context for the 20 MPH speed limit signs, reinforcing Neighborhood Greenway routes as places for walking and bicycling and encouraging those uses. Keep an eye out for the new signs on the following Greenways:</p>
<p>&bull; N Michigan, <br />&bull; N/NE Blandena /Going /Alberta, <br />&bull; SE Salmon /Taylor, &amp;<br />&bull; SE Bush /100th/101st</p>
<p>A total of 95 signs will be installed. As funding permits, the signs will be added to other Neighborhood Greenways, phased in gradually over time.&nbsp; These signs can also be included in the design of new Neighborhood Greenways.</p>

<p><img class=""content-right"" title=""NE 82nd Ave at NE Pacific"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=526623"" alt=""NE 82nd Ave at NE Pacific"" width=""350"" height=""219"" />Southeast 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue is one of ten High Crash Corridors that the Portland Bureau of Transportation has prioritized for stepped up education, enforcement and safety improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; Drivers are required to stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when the pedestrian is in the motor lane or the adjacent lane.&nbsp; Drivers are required to stop for the entire length of the crossing if the person crossing is blind and using a white cane or guide dog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure to stop and stay stopped for a pedestrian in the crossing is a Class B violation with a fine of approximately $260.</p>
<p>The NE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and NE Pacific Street crossing has no paint lines at the crosswalk. It does have a pedestrian median island and signage to alert drivers to the possible presence of pedestrians in the crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.</p>
<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Sharon White will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during the first half of the action and a Portland police officer will serve that role during the second half.</p>
<p>Crosswalk enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus do enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

News,526493,Affirming Portland’s Status as a Platinum Bicycling City,1,,2015-04-24 22:37:09 UTC,2015-04-16 20:42:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(April 16, 2015)</p>
<p>Portland is a platinum bicycle-friendly city because our investments in bicycle transportation have been effective.<strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The increase in Portlander&rsquo;s bicycling to work since 2000 has been the primary reason why drive alone commute trips have dropped from 64% in 2000 to 57% in 2013 (last year for which census data is available).</li>
<li>Bicycle transportation captured the biggest share of the 40,350 increase in daily commute trips by Portlanders since 2000. At 34% of that total, bicycle transportation is leading Portland&rsquo;s efforts at limiting congestion. It is more than double the number of increased car trips.</li>
<li>We are also seeing Portland students ride to school at eight times the national average. We have seen bicycling and walking to school increase 35% since 2006.</li>
<li>We recently installed our 125<sup>th</sup> bicycle corral. Business owners understand that attracting people who bicycle is good for their business. This is supported by <a href=""http://trec.pdx.edu/research/researcher/Clifton/4515/related/products"">research conducted by Portland State University</a> that found that people who arrive to commercial districts by bicycle spend more over the course of a month than do people arriving any other way (download OTREC-RR-12-15 report from above link).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Efforts since 2013</em></strong></h2>
<p>Portland has never wavered in its commitment to create a world-class bicycling city. We continue the types of efforts that first won Portland platinum-level bicycle friendly community status in 2008. Portland was re-affirmed as a platinum-level bicycle-friendly community in 2013. At the time we had a bikeway network of 329 (centerline) miles. Today Portland has 345 bikeway miles with another 38 miles funded. Since Portland was last re-affirmed at the platinum level the city has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded our bikeway network</li>
<li>Made significant upgrades to existing bikeways</li>
<li>Built some of the best active transportation infrastructure in the country</li>
<li>Secured funding for significant further expansion</li>
<li>Opened our 125<sup>th</sup> bicycle corral</li>
<li>Encouraged and educated thousands of Portland adults and children about bicycle transportation</li>
<li>Slowed down people driving on high crash and residential streets and</li>
<li>Advanced cutting-edge policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know our work is not done. We continue to strive to improve our bicycle transportation systems in support of our goals of creating a livable, equitable, healthy and prosperous city.</p>
<h3><strong>Since 2013, Portland has:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Completed the following Engineering and Safety Projects:</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Implemented the 4-mile 50&rsquo;s bikeway project ($1.5 million) that included the removal of 200 on-street parking spaces (1.8 miles), diverted traffic from a neighborhood greenway, created 20 mph speed limits on more than 2 miles of the corridor, installed a bicycle-only signal and implemented an innovative use of the rectangular rapid flash beacon for a bicycle crossing</li>
<li>Implemented the 2-mile North Williams Traffic Safety project ($1.5 million) that converted a five-foot bicycle lane on one of Portland&rsquo;s busiest bicycle corridors into an eight- to 12-foot buffered bicycle lane through the removal of travel lanes and on-street parking</li>
<li>Created the 2.8-mile 80&rsquo;s bikeway neighborhood greenway, bringing those streets down to 20 miles per hour</li>
<li>Built the 1.8-mile North Michigan neighborhood greenway</li>
<li>Built the Going to the River project, which included an improved pathway from residential N Portland to Swan Island, a key employment destination</li>
<li>Built the 4.8-mile North Portland Connector neighborhood greenway in North Portland</li>
<li>Striped bicycle lanes through the Montavilla commercial district</li>
<li>Performed a road diet on SE Division Street that allowed us to extend bicycle lanes further west and negate the need for going over Mt. Tabor when bicycling in that corridor</li>
<li>Built the 2-mile Holman Street neighborhood greenway and extended the Bryant street greenway further to the west</li>
<li>Removed a travel lane on NW Everett Street to create buffered bicycle lanes from NW 23<sup>rd</sup> Avenue to 14<sup>th</sup> Avenue</li>
<li>Striped bicycle lanes on SW Vermont Street</li>
<li>Built a raised cycle track on a segment of SW Multnomah Street</li>
<li>Created buffered bicycle lanes on the totality of the 2.5-mile Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway in SW Portland</li>
<li>Created buffered bicycle lanes along SW Broadway to make the Broadway to Barbur Blvd connection in SW Portland</li>
<li>Created buffered bicycle lanes on the city-owned portion of Barbur Boulevard</li>
<li>Opened the Gibbs Street bicycle- and pedestrian-bridge between Corbett Lair Hill Terwilliger neighborhood and South Waterfront</li>
<li>Opened the first segment of the completed South Waterfront Willamette Greenway Trail</li>
<li>Extended the Columbia Slough Trail another mile to the west, where it will meet up with another project that will decommission a roadway and convert it to a bicycle-pedestrian pathway</li>
<li>Built the Clinton to the River connection, that includes dedicated cycle track, off-street pathway, signalized crossings of SE 11<sup>th</sup> and SE 12<sup>th</sup> Avenues along a historic bicycle demand path</li>
<li>Built buffered bicycle lanes along SE 17<sup>th</sup> Avenue that connects to a bicycle-pedestrian overcrossing of Powell Boulevard</li>
<li>Build nine-foot buffered bicycle lanes along a half-mile of NE Killingsworth Street with another mile of that corridor funded for similar development</li>
<li>We recently added our 18<sup>th</sup> intersection with a bicycle-specific signal (N Vancouver &amp; Wheeler) with four more intersections currently funded for bicycle specific signals (all pedestrian hybrids/HAWKS)</li>
<li>We recently added our 29<sup>th</sup> bicycle box (at our 20<sup>th</sup> intersection) with the addition of bicycle boxes alone the heavily bicycle-trafficked SE Ladd Avenue/SE 21<sup>st</sup> Avenue intersection.</li>
<li>We installed our 125<sup>th</sup> on-street bike corral; this added to the approximately 6,600 city-provided spots in Portland for bicycle parking (This does not include the inventory of bicycle parking on private property. Our development code requires both long- and short-term bicycle parking with each new development or re-development with number of spaces tied to proposed use and building size).</li>
<li>We updated our bicycle parking code and are in the process of preparing additional updates to address parking spacing, number of spaces provided, proportion of hanging vs standing racks and requirements for large bicycles (cargo bikes, etc).</li>
<li>We have undertaken a myriad of signing, crossing, and painting projects that enhance the city&rsquo;s existing bikeway network; most notably we just installed new wayfinding signs for our neighborhood greenways.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Projects under construction:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>The Tilikum Crossing, which will be the largest transit- bicycle- and pedestrian-only bridge in North America</li>
<li>The reconstructed Sellwood Bridge, which adds no additional automotive capacity (one travel lane in each direction) but adds 36 feet of bikeway and pedestrian facilities, including two 12-foot shared pathways and two 6-foot bicycle lanes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Upcoming Projects (funded)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bike Share will launch in 2016.</li>
<li>SE Foster Rd. ($5.2 million). This 2-mile project through the heart of the Foster Business District will remove travel lanes and on-street parking in favor of buffered bicycle lanes on a corridor where none currently exist. This project, though it could increase travel times alone the corridor by as much as 3 minutes during the afternoon rush hour and cause automotive diversion onto nearby streets, was vigorously supported by the business district as well as by local residents</li>
<li>East Portland Active Transportation to Transit ($4.2 million). This project is currently at 60% design and will help establish a low-stress bikeway network in East Portland, where few such facilities exist. It will transform this suburban-styled part of town with five miles of neighborhood greenways and high quality bicycle parking at three transit stations serving the Green Line light rail line. Other elements of the project include a neighborhood-wide encouragement program once the bicycle facilities are in place.</li>
<li>Regional Economic Opportunity Fund in East Portland ($9 million). This project will provide access to transit throughout East Portland and will include development of the 100&rsquo;s and 150s neighborhood greenways, both of which are significant north-south corridors.</li>
<li>Central City Multi-Modal Transportation Safety Project ($6 million) will kick off next fiscal year. This project is slated to bring to Portland&rsquo;s central city the network of cycle tracks necessary to attract the &ldquo;interested but concerned&rdquo; person into Portland&rsquo;s downtown on a network of all ages and abilities bikeways.</li>
<li>Time Oil Road project will add a 1.25-mile two-way protected bicycle lane along N Lombard and Burgard Streets in North Portland making a connection between N Bruce and the pathway system along N Lombard north of Columbia Boulevard</li>
<li>N Rodney a 1.5-mile north-south neighborhood greenway that will run through an area of high existing bicycle use and higher potential use.</li>
<li>20&rsquo;s bikeway project, which is currently at 90% design, will build a 7-mile north-south bikeway through the heart of inner-east Portland.</li>
<li>The Connect Cully project will build out a network of low-volume shared roadways (driving, walking, bicycling) that will also create 3 &frac12; miles of north-south neighborhood greenways along three neighborhood corridors</li>
<li>Neighborhood Greenways Assessment Report. Currently under way, this report will identify where neighborhood greenways are working well and where they are not; create an understanding of the role they play in Portland&rsquo;s transportation system; and offer policy and design recommendations to allow greenways to achieve their full potential.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Streets</strong> &ndash; Portland conducted 10 Sunday Parkways events in the past 2 years with a record-breaking 135,000 people in attendance in 2014</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transportation Demand Management</strong> &ndash; Portland launched a new outreach effort called &ldquo;Welcome Smart Trips&rdquo; that provides information and outreach to new residents. Research shows this is when people make life changes.&nbsp; Our results show a 7% reduction in drive alone trips and an increase of 8% in active transportation modes from our last year&rsquo;s SmartTrips program. These are phenomenal numbers. Seventy eight percent (3,076) of all people who order materials get bicycling materials, which are the most requested.</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Safe Routes to Schools (since 2013):</strong></li>
<li><strong></strong>10,930 students taught to safely navigate their neighborhood by bike with our 10-hour hands-on Bike Safety Education program</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Over 43,000 students served by Safe Routes to School at 100+ schools&mdash;including elementary and middle schools&mdash;in five school districts [PPS, David Douglas, Parkrose, Centennial and Reynolds] plus several private and charter schools</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
<ul type=""circle"">
<li>$4.9 million+ in grant funds awarded to date for Safe Routes to School capital improvements around schools</li>
<li>Rates of walking and bicycling to school have increased 35% since 2006</li>
<li>Program evaluations conducted by the Portland Safe Routes program consistently show that Portland has much higher rates of walking and biking to school than nationally:
<ul type=""square"">
<li>8% of Portland students get to school by bike, vs. 1% nationally</li>
<li>32% of Portland students get to school on foot, vs. 11% nationally</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Enforcement and Vision Zero </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Portland has embraced Vision Zero as part of Portland Progress, our two-year workplan that guides PBOT&rsquo;s actions across the agency. This includes a variety of specific actions PBOT is taking to reduce fatalities, including the initiative to sponsor a bill in the Legislature to create a pilot program for unmanned photo radar safety cameras on High Crash Corridors.</li>
<li>Safety &ndash; Three years ago Portland launched a High Crash Corridor program to steer our resources to where fatalities and serious injuries were occurring.&nbsp; PBOT coordinates with Portland Police on cross-walk enforcements on these streets, which makes the street safer for everyone.</li>
<li>Speed - Portland has formally proposed a new process in Oregon that for the first time would allow Portland to set its own speed limits on non-arterial, local roads.&nbsp; We have made a formal request to the State Speed Zone Board and we will be presenting our case in a special meeting of that board.
<ul>
<li>In the past year we have lowered the speed limits on SE Division and NE Glisan from 35 mph to 30 mph.</li>
<li>We recently lowered speed limits on SW Multnomah and SW Vermont Streets.</li>
<li>We have applied to lower the posted speed on E Burnside from 35 mph to 30 mph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Maintenance</strong></h3>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways and most streets with bicycle facilities are prioritized for preventive maintenance. Since 2013 we have repaved or re-sealed many miles of the streets that form Portland&rsquo;s bikeway network, including neighborhood greenways and arterial street bikeways.</p>
<h3><strong>Bicycle Use</strong></h3>
<p>From our local counts we have seen bicycle use increase citywide approximately 3% per year in each of the past three years. This is based on city-organized volunteer summer counts at approximately 200 locations city wide. Results vary by part of city with some areas showing larger increases than others.</p>
<p>According to the US Census Bureau we saw an increase of 40,354 daily Portland commuters between 2000 and 2013 (the last year for which census data is currently available). The below chart shows how that growth in commuters broke out by means of transportation.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that bicycle transportation has been the biggest contributor to the drop in driving to work from 64% of commuters in 2000 to 57% in 2013. Bicycle transportation has been the biggest contributor to limiting congestion generated by the increased number of Portland commuters.</p>
<h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3>
<p>The question of funding is critical to the work we do. As evidenced by our recent efforts with the <a href=""/transportation/64188"">Our Streets</a> program to raise funding for transportation maintenance and safety projects, funding for the Portland Bureau of Transportation is limited.&nbsp; Almost all the capital projects we undertake are done with grant funding from other sources. This limitation is perhaps best understood through looking at the buffered bicycle lane project done on NE Killingsworth, an example where we leveraged the opportunity to make better infrastructure for everyone by adding a bike improvement to a pavement maintenance project. The first segment, described above on page 2, was implemented as part of a repaving project in our Back to Basics preventive maintenance program. The only minimal cost associated with the buffered bicycle lane was the striping. To extend the facility the last mile will require grinding out all existing striping on the roadway before restriping. The total cost would be $50,000. Fifty thousand dollars represents approximately one-third of the Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s local and discretionary annual funding for bikeway projects. With more funding, PBOT would be able to undertake more of the types of projects we want to and need to build.</p>
<p>Because of our complete streets policies and Oregon&rsquo;s complete street laws, almost all PBOT projects, regardless of type, include bicycle and pedestrian elements.</p>
<h3><strong>Policies</strong></h3>
<p>Portland, in the course of updating our city&rsquo;s Comprehensive Plan and Transportation System Plan, will adopt an overarching bicycle transportation policy that states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bicycle transportation</strong>. Create conditions that make bicycling more attractive than driving for most trips of approximately three miles or less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A supporting policy states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accessible bicycle system</strong>. Create a bicycle transportation system that is safe, comfortable, and accessible to people of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also be adopting a policy known by many planners as the &ldquo;Green Transportation Hierarchy&rdquo;. Officially called the Transportation Strategy for People Movement it outlines an ordered list that must be addressed in every transportation system decision:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transportation strategy for people movement</strong>. Implement a prioritization of modes for people movement by making transportation system decisions according to the following ordered list:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Walking</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Cycling</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Transit</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Taxi/Commercial Transit/Shared Vehicles</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Zero emission vehicles</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Other private vehicles</p>
<p><br /> When implementing this prioritization, ensure:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; The needs and safety of each group of road users are considered, and changes do not make existing conditions worse for the most vulnerable users higher on the ordered list.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; All users&rsquo; needs are balanced with the intent of optimizing the right of way for multiple modes on the same street</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; When necessary to ensure safety, accommodate some users on parallel streets as part of a multi-street corridors.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; Land use and system plans, network functionality for all modes, other street functions, and complete street policies, is maintained.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; Rationale is provided if modes lower in the ordered list are prioritized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, the new Comprehensive Plan will have as a goal some of the strongest transportation safety language to date:</p>
<p><strong>Goal 9.G: Safety</strong></p>
<p>Transportation safety contributes to a livable city and ensures that people of all ages and abilities feel comfortable and secure using City streets. Human impact and economic costs are reduced by comprehensive efforts to improve traffic safety, including engineering, education, enforcement, and evaluation, all of which will move Portland toward zero traffic&#8208;related fatalities and no serious injuries.</p>

News,526682,"News Release: Hales, Novick propose 120-day pilot program for taxis and Uber, Lyft and other Transportation Network Companies",1,,2017-02-07 22:08:51 UTC,2015-04-17 20:55:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(April 17, 2015) Mayor Charlie Hales and Commissioner Steve Novick today proposed a 120-day pilot program that will modernize for-hire transportation in Portland and ensure fair competition between all private for hire operators, including both taxis and Transportation Network Companies such as Uber and Lyft.</p>
<p>The proposal builds on the recommendations by the Private for Hire Innovation Task Force, which Novick appointed in December to examine the issue and recommend how the City should modernize its regulations. Evolving consumer interests, population growth and a booming tourism industry have generated more demand for taxis and other for-hire transportation service. In addition, Transportation Network Companies, such as Uber and Lyft, have emerged as a new model of for-hire transportation service.</p>
<p>Under the proposal by Hales and Novick, the City would lift the cap on taxi fares, so taxis and TNCs could both set their own fares without city regulation. Both taxis and TNCs would be required to provide service to people with disabilities, provide service 24 hours a day/seven days a week and certify that their drivers have passed City-approved background checks. The City will audit these records to enforce compliance. The resolution directs Transportation Director Leah Treat to create and sign an administrative rule launching the pilot program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a historic deal,&rdquo; Mayor Charlie Hales said. &ldquo;We were able to move from confrontation to collaboration, with an open process and tough negotiations that have come up with a result that will improve our transportation system and creates a real win for consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The existing taxi companies have had two lines of argument against the pilot. One is, simply, that they should be protected from competition in order to ensure a living wage for drivers and good service for people with disabilities. Given that our best information is that the average net hourly income of Portland taxi drivers is $6.22 an hour, and given the complaints people in the disability community have about taxi service, we are not entirely persuaded by that argument,&rdquo; said Commissioner Novick, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;But the other line of argument is that any competition needs to be fair competition. We agree with that, and in order to ensure fair competition, the proposed framework makes some changes to the task force&rsquo;s recommendations &ndash; and underscores certain features of those recommendations that might not have been well understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Portland City Council is scheduled to conduct a public hearing and vote on <a title=""Private For-Hire Transportation Innovation Pilot Program: Transportation Network Service Guiding Regulatory Principles"" href=""/transportation/article/526684"">the resolution by Hales and Novick</a>&nbsp;on at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 21. The hearing will be held at City Council Chambers, Portland City Hall, 1221 SW Fourth Ave.</p>
<p>Under the proposed framework:</p>

<p>The framework differs in some respects from the private for hire task force recommendations the City Council heard last week. It does not include a cap on taxi fares. It also includes specific language on TNCs&rsquo; legal liabilities.</p>
<p>The Task Force is recommending a two-phase approach, which still guides City action. Phase 1 includes a 120-day TNC pilot program, during which time market data will be collected and analyzed. During Phase 2, the Task Force will assess the market data and solicit public input that will inform recommendations for an overhaul to all of the City&rsquo;s PFHT rules. The Task Force&rsquo;s final report is expected this summer and will include recommendations for all modes of for-hire transportation, including taxicabs, TNCs, accessible for-hire transportation service, Limited Passenger Transportation companies, pedicabs and shuttles.</p>
<p>Hales and Novick thanked the Task Force for its recommendations, which were the basis for the resolution. &ldquo;This task force did the City an incredible service by tackling these tough issues in a very tight timeframe,&rdquo; Hales said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the task force, the City Council can rest assured that our pilot program has been thoroughly vetted,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;The task force did groundbreaking work, and I look forward to their report this summer on broader for-hire transportation issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City of Portland has been regulating private for hire transportation for more than a century, and that responsibility was moved in July 2014 from the Office of Management and Finance to the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

News,528911,News Release: Real-time map helps Portlanders track new energy-saving LED street light installations in each Portland neighborhood,1,,2015-04-30 23:09:55 UTC,2015-04-30 23:06:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(April 30, 2015) &ndash; &nbsp;Portland&rsquo;s largest ever energy-efficiency project is happening&nbsp;citywide with the installation of energy-saving LED street lights in each neighborhood, and an <a href=""/transportation/66147"">interactive map</a> allows the public to track real-time progress on their street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=528910"" alt=""LED graphic"" width=""385"" height=""177"" />The Portland Bureau of Transportation crews are converting 45,000 of the City&rsquo;s 55,000 street lights to environmentally-friendly&nbsp;LED (light-emitting diode) lights, a process that is expected to be complete by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The map and program may be found at <a href=""http://bit.ly/PDXLED""><strong>http://bit.ly/PDXLED</strong></a>. Green dots show lights that have been installed; red indicates lights that will be converted. The map also allows the public to send in questions and feedback on each street light.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new LED street lights are easily identifiable: they cast a crisp light similar to moonlight, unlike the yellow-tinged light from the high-pressure sodium bulbs they replace.&nbsp; The new LEDs bring numerous benefits: they use half the energy of the high-pressure sodium bulbs and are expected to last four times longer, or up to 20 years. That translates to a $1.5 million annual savings in energy and maintenance, and a reduction of about 10,500 tons of carbon pollution each year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can all be proud of the savings that the new LED street lights bring to each neighborhood,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;This is a program that saves money, protects our environment and improves reliability by providing street lights that last longer and burn out less often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new streetlights deliver benefits to each neighborhood, to our city as a whole and to our efforts to address climate change,&rdquo; said Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We are making a difference street by street and light by light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cities around the world are switching to LED lights as a way to save both money and energy, including Portland&rsquo;s neighbors to the north in Seattle and nearby in Gresham, Lake Oswego, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Clackamas County and Milwaukie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new lights provide the same coverage to illuminate city streets as the old fixtures. They also cut down on light pollution by projecting more light downward and less upward, making it easier for people to star gaze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final environmental benefit? The City is recycling the old high pressure sodium bulbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>City Council unanimously passed an ordinance in December 2012 dedicating $18.5 million to the conversion project from a general obligation bond.&nbsp; Conversions began in August and once the project is complete, about December 2016, the City can expect to save $1.5 million a year in maintenance and energy costs. At that rate, the project will pay for itself in eight years, with future years&rsquo; savings providing funds for other transportation projects.&nbsp;</p>

News,529804,Portland’s first 24-hour volunteer bike count on May 14-15,1,,2015-05-14 02:16:10 UTC,2015-05-08 18:01:00 UTC,A,Every Bike Counts,"<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=529803"" alt=""photo of bicycle count"" width=""500"" height=""283.555555556"" /></p>
<p class=""content-center""><em>Every Bike Counts!</em></p>
<p>(May 8, 2015) As part of May&rsquo;s Bike Month festivities, PBOT&rsquo;s Active Transportation Division will host Portland&rsquo;s first-ever 24-hour volunteer bike count, Every Bike Counts, May 14-15 at SE Ankeny &amp; 28th Ave. Starting at noon on Thursday and wrapping up at noon on Friday, a cadre of bike count volunteers will take turns tallying all the bikes that travel through the intersection. A nearby Celebration Station will provide bike riders with a pit stop of refreshments and chances to win prizes from local businesses.</p>
<p><em>Every Bike Counts</em> will use the methodology of PBOT&rsquo;s annual <a href=""/TRANSPORTATION/article/490280"">summer bike counts</a> by tracking turning movements, helmet use, and gender of each rider. The event also aims to recruit new volunteers for the annual bike counts, which constitute the bulk of Portland&rsquo;s bike ridership data. Dozens of volunteers count at more than 200 intersections across the city every summer to log bike traffic, forming an impressive database that is one of the biggest in the country.</p>
<p>But as extensive as Portland&rsquo;s annual bike count is, it is still limited to just one two-hour count per intersection taken during peak car commute hours (typically 4-6pm, though some are completed 7-9am). This two-hour count is then used to estimate how many bikes travel through the intersection on a daily basis. We know that lots of people are riding bikes beyond typical commute hours, and that they are using bikes for trips other than the commute to work. <em>Every Bike Counts</em> provides an opportunity to say thanks to all those riders, no matter what time of day or where their destination.</p>
<p>Monitoring one intersection for 24 hour will also provide some interesting qualitative data by asking riders where they are going. How many people are using their bike to get to the grocery store? To school? To a restaurant? There will also be hourly reports on ridership &ndash; is anyone actually riding their bike at 4am?</p>
<p>Of course, more sophisticated methods for gathering 24-hour ridership data exist &ndash; such as the automated hose counts on Portland&rsquo;s five bike-friendly bridges (Broadway, Burnside, <a href=""http://portland-hawthorne-bridge.visio-tools.com/"">Hawthorne</a>, Morrison and Steel). However, it is cost-prohibitive to have these at more than just a few locations. Obtaining quality data across the city is a necessary goal to move toward.</p>
<p>Better data informs better decisions for keeping Portland streets safe and traffic moving in all neighborhoods. Imagine a small, unobtrusive sensor that can track bike movements to show real-time trip data. PBOT is partnering with local startup Knock to pilot an innovative low cost bike counter. PBOT and Knock staff to conduct the first road test of the counter prototype at <em>Every Bike Counts</em>.</p>
<p>The future is almost here! But in the meantime, Portland will continue to use clipboards and pens to record history&rsquo;s bike riders. <em>Every Bike Counts</em> provides an opportunity to celebrate today&rsquo;s riders and plan for those of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Better Block PDX, a local group of public space advocates, has obtained a permit from the Portland Bureau of Transportation to provide one northbound motor vehicle lane that is physically separated from a protected bicycle and pedestrian space to help everyone safely and comfortably access the waterfront. The lane will be converted on Friday May 22 through June 5, and will open nearly a mile of street, 15 feet wide, to public use.</p>
<p>WHO: &nbsp;Commissioner Steve Novick, oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation Ryan Hashagen, Better Block PDX Leah Treat, Transportation Director, Portland Bureau of Transportation Rich Jarvis, Rose Festival spokesman Vice President Jonathan Fink, Research and Strategic Partnerships, Portland State University representative Oregon Walks, pedestrian safety group</p>
<p>WHAT: &nbsp;Announcement of a big change to a key downtown street during Rose Festival. For two weeks starting Friday, the four-lane SW Naito Parkway have three lanes plus a lane of open space for the public to walk and bike safely to the festival.</p>
<p>WHEN: &nbsp;1:30 p.m. Tuesday, May 19, 2015</p>
<p>WHERE:&nbsp;Salmon Springs Fountain, intersection of SW Salmon and SW Naito Parkway. Parking available on street nearby on Naito Parkway.</p>
<p>WHY:&nbsp;Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the Rose Festival have become so successful and popular, they draw hundreds of thousands of people to the waterfront. But to reach the festival, Oregonians are too often forced to squeeze into narrow sidewalks, walk in a bike lane, or bike in a travel lane with high-speed traffic. The goal of this project is to alleviate these conflicts and to create a safe space for all Oregonians. This innovative pilot project will allow the community to provide feedback on potential changes to the Naito Parkway street design. Better Block PDX has obtained funding for this project from People for Bikes and Clif Bar.</p>
<p>VISUAL: &nbsp;Commissioner Novick, Director Treat and project leaders stand with handheld microphones at the site where the road closure and public space opening will start on Friday. Volunteers will also show how the facility will be utilized by walking and biking on a closed section of Naito Parkway that approximates what the area will be like during the pilot project. In case of rain, the event will be held in a nearby covered stage inside the Rose Festival grounds. A mult box for audio feeds will be provided.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Better Block PDX, a local group of public space advocates, has obtained a permit from the Portland Bureau of Transportation to implement a design developed by a team of civil engineering students from Portland State University to provide one northbound motor vehicle lane that is physically separated from a protected bicycle and pedestrian space to help everyone safely and comfortably access the waterfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pilot projects such as this one highlight how we can use our streets to foster economic development, livability and tourism,&rdquo; said Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;In the downtown waterfront, we have become a victim of our own success. The waterfront path exceeds its capacity during peak tourist season. We need to provide a safe space for people to travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Naito Pilot Project is a quintessential example of how transportation infrastructure plays a critical role in strengthening the social fabric of our city.&nbsp; It is one of many ways PBOT continues to be a partner in creating a livable city and providing opportunities for our residents to become actively engaged in the public right of way,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Waterfront Park and the Rose Festival have become so successful and popular, they draw hundreds of thousands of people to the waterfront. But to reach the festival, Oregonians are too often forced to squeeze into narrow sidewalks, walk in a bike lane, or bike in a travel lane with high-speed traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting Friday May 22 and lasting through June 5, the four-lane SW Naito Parkway will have three travel lanes, plus a lane of open space for the public to walk and bike safely to the festival. The pilot project will open nearly a mile of street, 15 feet wide, to public use, from SW Salmon Street to NW Couch Street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Block is excited to continue the conversation about public space on our downtown waterfront that was started by Gov. Tom McCall,&rdquo; said Ryan Hashagen, a volunteer with the group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this spring, the Office of Commissioner Novick, Better Block PDX, PBOT and the Rose Festival had all identified the need to make access to the park more comfortable during the festival&rsquo;s CityFair, which draws an estimated 20,000 people a day to the waterfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a permanent resident of Waterfront Park, we see a remarkable diversity in transportation methods used here daily,&rdquo; said Rich Jarvis, Portland Rose Festival Foundation Public Relations Manager. &ldquo;We know that special events like the Festival can impact how people get to and around the park and we are excited to partner with PBOT and Better Blocks PDX to help make it a safer and more accessible experience for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland State University President Wim Wiewel said he is excited about the project. &ldquo;For a university that strives every day to heed the motto, 'Let Knowledge Serve The City,' there is no clearer sign of success than a student project being brought to life in the heart of our city.""</p>

That was one of many takeaways from the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) first human powered 24-hour bike count event. <em>Every Bike Counts</em> began counting people biking on SE Ankeny at 28<sup>th</sup> Avenue on Thursday, May 14<sup>th</sup> at noon and continued through the night until noon on Friday, National Bike to Work Day.</p>
<p>One part <a href=""/TRANSPORTATION/article/531278"">data gathering</a> and one part celebration, the event counted 2,231 people riding bikes during the 24 hour period. Volunteers and PBOT staff counted 325 people biking at the peak hour between 5:00 &ndash; 6:00 p.m. and 6 people during the pre-dawn hours of 3:00 &ndash; 4:00 a.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title=""Click graphic for larger version"" href=""/TRANSPORTATION/article/531278""><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=531285"" alt=""Table of hourly bike counts"" width=""250"" height=""142.857142857"" /></a>In true Portland style, number crunching was combined with festivity, as local businesses provided food and refreshments, bands provided music, and staff and volunteers provided minor bike repair.</p>
<p>One of <a href=""http://www.pdxbikemonth.com/"">20-plus events</a> during May&rsquo;s National Bike Month <em>Every Bike Counts</em> preceded PBOT&rsquo;s massive <a href=""/TRANSPORTATION/index.cfm?a=490280"">Summer Bike Count</a>, where staff and hundreds of volunteers conduct two-hour counts at 245 locations throughout Portland from June to September. In addition to these two-hour counts, PBOT conducts automated, continuous bike counts 365 days a year on Portland&rsquo;s five bike friendly bridges and the SW Moody multiuse path.&nbsp; You can view the bicycle trip data for the Hawthorne Bridge here: <a href=""http://portland-hawthorne-bridge.visio-tools.com/"">http://portland-hawthorne-bridge.visio-tools.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the Summer Bike Count, which uses the industry protocol of extrapolating the two-hour commute peak count to derive a daily number, the 24 hour count provided a more textured illustration of how people use one of Portland&rsquo;s most popular neighborhood greenways. Some trends remained the same: Helmet usage for men (74%) and women (85%) practically mirrored the 2014 Summer Bike Count usage (75%, 84% respectively).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title=""Click graphic for larger version"" href=""/TRANSPORTATION/article/531278""><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=531286"" alt=""Pie chart showing destinations reported"" width=""250"" height=""147.181628392"" /></a>While Portland&rsquo;s bicycle count data is the envy of the nation, it pales in comparison to motor vehicle travel data collected by regional and federal agencies. PBOT is partnering with a local technology startup, Knock to pilot a low-cost count sensor and smart phone app to explore cheaper, more reliable, 24-hour bike data collection options. Knock group did a test run during peak hours at <em>Every Bike Counts</em> and are comparing their data to the manual count data. PBOT and Knock plan to pilot the sensors later this summer. Those interested in beta testing the <a href=""http://ride.report/"">Ride smartphone app for iPhone</a> can email at <a href=""mailto:metoo@ride.com"">metoo@ride.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT chose the SE Ankeny/28<sup>th</sup> avenue intersection because it is a centrally located, well-utilized neighborhood greenway that intersects with a popular neighborhood commercial corridor.</p>
<p>The 24 hour bike count was lower than the 2014 SE Ankeny summer count estimate of 2715.&nbsp; Since the Summer Bike Counts are conducted only from Tuesdays through Thursdays (Mondays and Fridays typically have lower traffic volumes), the 24-hour Every Bike Counts count did not provide an apples-to-apples comparison to the Summer Bike Count data.</p>

<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; Drivers must stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when the pedestrian is in the motor lane or the adjacent lane.&nbsp; A bicycle lane and a parking lane are an extension of the adjacent motor lane.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=531340"" alt=""Oregon Crosswalk Law"" width=""640"" height=""205"" /></p>
<p><strong>Drivers must stop for pedestrians in the safety buffer zone indicated in yellow.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SE Powell Boulevard and SE 24<sup>th</sup> Avenue crossing is a &ldquo;T&rdquo; intersection with pavement markings, a pedestrian median island and signage to alert drivers to the possible presence of pedestrians in the crossing.&nbsp; This location is adjacent to Powell City Park and within two blocks of Cleveland High School and the crossing on 26<sup>th</sup> Avenue where a truck collided with a bicyclist earlier this month, severing the cyclist&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>Southeast Powell Boulevard is one of ten High Crash Corridors that PBOT has identified and prioritized for stepped up education, enforcement and safety improvements.</p>
<p>This is the sixth crosswalk enforcement action that PBOT and the Portland Police Bureau have conducted on Powell Boulevard since 2006.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=531341"" alt=""Google Streetview SE Powell and 24th"" width=""400"" height=""223"" />Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.</p>
<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Sharon White will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street from 10 a.m. to noon and 1 to 2 p.m. and a Portland police officer will serve that role from noon to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Crosswalk enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus do enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

News,532759,"News Release: Mayor Hales, Commissioner Novick underscore their support for Vision Zero as Portlanders unite for safer streets for all",1,,2015-06-02 22:47:29 UTC,2015-06-02 23:10:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(June 2, 2015) Mayor Charlie Hales and City Commissioner Steve Novick underscored their support on Tuesday for Vision Zero, the goal of providing a safe, multimodal transportation system where no one is killed on our streets.</p>
<p>In light of recent crashes in Portland, Hales committed a citywide effort, including the Portland Police Bureau and Portland Fire &amp; Rescue, to improve safety for all Portlanders, whether they are biking, walking or driving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been difficult to witness the death and injuries that occurred on our streets over the past several weeks,&rdquo; Mayor Hales said. &ldquo;My thoughts go out to the families and friends of those impacted, and the survivors of those crashes. No person should have to go through the traumatic experience of a serious crash, as Alistair Corkett suffered last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcement came at a news conference immediately following an afternoon meeting at City Hall with stakeholders, fire and police officials and the Oregon Department of Transportation. Mayor Hales and Commissioner Novick called for the public&rsquo;s help in reducing crashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are busy people and we all rush through our days &ndash; I get that, I am busy too.&nbsp; But no meeting, no appointment, no event is worth a life,&rdquo; Mayor Hales said. &ldquo;That person next to you in a car, or on a bike, or crossing the street, is someone&rsquo;s sister, mother, aunt or neighbor. Let&rsquo;s take care of each other.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look every direction before making a turn. A simple act &ndash; looking before you turn &ndash; could save a life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2014, there were 28 deaths in Portland due to traffic crashes and there have been 10 so far this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost 28 of our own last year,&rdquo; said Commissioner Novick, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;As the Mayor said, these deaths are tragic and they are preventable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many fatal crashes happen on just 10 streets, which PBOT has designated as High Crash Corridors. Though they represent only 3 percent of the roads in Portland, they account for 51 percent of all pedestrian fatalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These streets often run through the main thoroughfares in low-income communities,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;People in low-income neighborhoods are 2.3 times more likely to be struck and killed while walking than the average person. We must embrace Vision Zero to make Portland a more equitable place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Novick thanked the Mayor for including $4 million in safety improvements for 122nd Avenue, one of the High Crash Corridors, in the proposed budget that was approved by Council last week. TriMet has said that because these safety improvements improve access to transit, they make it much more likely that TriMet will upgrade to frequent bus service on 122<sup>nd</sup> Avenue, which has long been a community priority.</p>
<p>Transportation Director Leah Treat said PBOT is committed to Vision Zero and the Bureau has numerous new pedestrian crossing beacons and other safety improvements scheduled to be installed in the coming months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a year since I took this job and I announced my commitment to Vision Zero &ndash; the concept that deaths are not inevitable,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;Traffic deaths have huge health and economic costs to our society. I am tremendously proud of the work that we have accomplished to date in working towards Vision Zero. But we can do more. We can do it better. I have laid out a path forward, articulated in PBOT&rsquo;s 2-Year Workplan, called Portland Progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City has introduced House Bill 2621 in the state Legislature that would allow Portland to place safety cameras on High Crash Corridors, a proven way of reducing fatal crashes. In addition, Treat recently made a formal request to the Oregon Speed Zone Control Board seeking to expedite the process for setting speeds on city streets, taking into account how and when pedestrians and cyclists use the road. While that request is pending, the City recently successfully reduced speeds on SE Division and Burnside, two high crash corridors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working with our partners at ODOT to invest federal dollars in places where the worst crashes occur,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;More is on the horizon. We&rsquo;re going to follow the data. We are going to experiment and find out what works. And where we see problem areas, that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going to apply safety tools most intensely, and keep driving down these numbers, and keep saving peoples&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud that PBOT could deliver this crosswalk based on the strong community input in Old Town,&rdquo; Commissioner Novick says. &ldquo;Portlanders have long recognized that a quality pedestrian atmosphere is the backbone for a vibrant downtown retail environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project originated when members of the Old Town Chinatown Community Association approached the transportation bureau for ways to foster a more vibrant and attractive pedestrian atmosphere. PBOT Director Treat, familiar with creative crosswalks in San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver B.C., introduced that concept, which the community adopted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our streets are the largest public space in our city, representing one quarter of our land.&nbsp; They should be pleasant and safe places that foster community and business, and that&rsquo;s what we are doing here through this public-private partnership,&rdquo; says Treat. &ldquo;Together, we are delivering a safer and more inviting crossing. This creative project is a small investment with a big return.&rdquo;</p>

I am extremely proud of contributing to the betterment of the city I grew up in and where I own a business,&rdquo; Kaempf says. &ldquo;It was a wonderful experience to work with the city, my neighborhood, and local businesses to come up with a new, iconic installation that we expect will improve safety and draw positive attention to the neighborhood and businesses here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""PBOTTEXT"">""We at The Society Hotel are so thrilled to be part of the revitalization of Old Town/Chinatown,&rdquo; said Jessie Burke, co-owner of the Old Town hotel that opens this fall. &ldquo;We've seen in the almost two years since we purchased The Mariner's Home on NW 3rd and Davis, that it's the little things - like safer crosswalks - that have made the biggest difference.&nbsp; And it makes it all the more fun to see these safety measures being made more creative by neighborhood design firms like Ampersand Content.&nbsp; It's projects like this that make me love this city - getting to be a little more creative, and in turn, bring the community even closer.""</p>
<p class=""PBOTTEXT"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation is part of a series of crosswalk improvements to the neighborhood. &nbsp;PBOT recently installed conventional crosswalk markings in surrounding blocks, including SW Davis Street and Fourth Avenue one block away. &nbsp;PBOT, in partnership with the Portland Development Commission, also is installing curb extensions at SW Third Avenue and Burnside Street.</p>

In Portland, 50+ elementary, middle and high schools participated by getting to and from school using active transportation. Students tracked their trips and at the middle and high school levels organized activities. Of course Safe Routes to School couldn&rsquo;t do it without great school coordinators. They organized, promoted, prodded, encouraged and awarded students and families.</p>
<p>Also during last month, <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/transportation_options/sets/72157651279588483"">Bike Fairies visited schools</a> to thank students and school staff for biking to school as part of National Bike Month. The Bike Fairies legs were tired after visiting 100 schools and placing 1,218 thank you notes on bikes. But the excitement from the students was well worth it.</p>

News,534519,"News Release: With City Council set to consider Vision Zero goal, Portland takes action to improve transportation safety for everyone",1,,2015-06-17 16:07:42 UTC,2015-06-17 00:47:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(June 16, 2015) The City of Portland is poised to make major strides in implementing a Vision Zero transportation safety goal this week, including City Council policy actions, potential new speed control authority and a new driver safety pledge intended to help all Portlanders travel more safely.</p>
<p>Mayor Hales and Commissioner Steve Novick will announce on Wednesday that they have taken a Vision Zero pledge to support the global campaign&nbsp;to end traffic fatalities and serious injuries. They are calling on their Council colleagues to join them in adopting Vision Zero for the entire City government and in so doing are encouraging all City employees to sign on to contribute to a safer, healthier Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased that the City Council will consider several important steps that will lead our actions on Vision Zero and reinforce recent investments that will make our multimodal transportation system safer for everyone,&rdquo; Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;This will further enhance the safety work we have under way across the City, including the actions I laid out in Portland Progress, PBOT&rsquo;s two-year action plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Portland City Council on Wednesday will consider a resolution endorsing Vision Zero as the City&rsquo;s policy and direct PBOT to form a committee to advise on Vision Zero with diverse areas of expertise, including law enforcement, education, public health and emergency response.</p>
<p>City Council will also consider accepting a $150,000 grant from the Oregon Department of Transportation to develop the Vision Zero Transportation Safety Action Plan. The plan will undertake a one-year effort, informed by traffic crash data, to generate specific policy recommendations and actions to reach Vision Zero by 2025. Both items are scheduled for 10:45 a.m. at the Council meeting.</p>
<p>Recent and upcoming actions to improve transportation safety and implement Vision Zero include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In East Portland, PBOT plans<strong> </strong>to install 24 rapid flash beacons in 2015, more than double the 20 beacons operational there as of 2014.</li>
<li>On Wednesday afternoon, PBOT officials will seek permission from the Oregon Speed Zone Board to expedite the process for setting speeds on city streets, taking into account how and when pedestrians and cyclists use the road. While that request is pending, the City recently successfully reduced speeds on SE Division and Burnside, which are both classified as High Crash Corridors.</li>
<li>PBOT has been supporting House Bill 2621, which would allow Portland to install fixed photo radar safety cameras to reduce speeding on the City&rsquo;s High Crash Corridors. The 10 designated High Crash Corridors make up just 3 percent of the City&rsquo;s road network, but they account for more than 50 percent of pedestrian fatalities in Portland. The bill is scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday at 1 p.m. in Room H-174 of the State Capitol Building in Salem.</li>
<li>The City Council recently approved the City&rsquo;s biggest investment in the High Crash Corridor Program. The 2015-16 Budget approved on May 27 includes $8 million for maintenance and safety improvements on 122<sup>nd</sup>Avenue in East Portland and $2.8 million for safety improvements on East and West Burnside.</li>
<li>The budget also includes $300,000 to begin to expand Portland&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School programs to middle and high schools. Council adoption of the 2015-16 Budget is scheduled for Thursday.</li>
<li>PBOT recently launched a new web site,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/"">VisionZeroPortland.com</a>, which includes the Vision Zero Crash Map, an interactive map that displays 10 years of injury and fatality data for people walking, biking and driving. It also includes maps showing locations of existing and funded East Portland rapid flash beacons. On Wednesday, it will include the Vision Zero Pledge, so all Portlanders can sign on.</li>

<p>With the start of summer, drivers can anticipate seeing more children and families out during the day going to and from the park, pool, community center, library, and other local destinations.</p>
<p>Children are smaller and often harder to see in or at the crosswalk.&nbsp; Children don&rsquo;t always make the most appropriate decisions about when and where to cross and they frequently dart out or run to get across the street.&nbsp; Drivers need to make sure they drive at or below the posted speed limit especially around parks, pools, community centers and other similar locations and scan your environment watching for pedestrians in the crossing or about to cross.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=534843"" alt=""NE Glisan and 87th Ave"" width=""300"" height=""149.147727273"" />The NE Glisan Street at NE 87th Avenue crossing is adjacent to Multnomah University and within four blocks of Montavilla City Park, Montavilla Community Center and swimming pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; Drivers must stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when the pedestrian is in the motor lane or the adjacent lane (motor lane plus 6&rsquo; on either side when the driver is making a turn at a traffic signal).&nbsp; A bike lane and a parking lane are an extension of the adjacent motor lane. ORS 811.028.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk education and enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.</p>
<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Sharon White and a Portland police officer will both serve as designated pedestrians crossing the street during the mission.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate pedestrian right of way laws to both drivers and pedestrians. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

News,230229,Going Electric!,1,,2015-07-09 15:50:17 UTC,2015-07-09 15:50:17 UTC,A,,"<p><img src=""http://ultramotor.com/UserFiles/PrdSmall_62.jpg"" alt="""" width=""128"" height=""140"" /><a href=""http://www.bikegallery.com"" target=""_blank"">Bike Gallery</a> recently lent me one of their newest products to test ride: an Ultra Motor A2B electric bicycle.&nbsp; The A2B&nbsp;(pictured, right)&nbsp;feels and rides like an electric scooter that you can pedal.&nbsp; With a twist of the wrist its electric motor&nbsp;will zip you around town at speeds up to 20 mph (without pedaling).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The A2B, and other electric bikes like it, are legal for riding in the bike lanes and bike paths&nbsp;in&nbsp;Oregon.&nbsp; They are good for people with longer commutes (8+ miles), commutes with big hills (pay attention, west siders!), or for people who want a scooter that they can&nbsp;also pedal and&nbsp;use on the bike lanes and trails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a variety of electric bikes on the market right now.&nbsp; Some, like the A2B, are more on the electric scooter end of the spectrum, others like the <a href=""http://www.giant-bicycles.com/backoffice/_upload_us/bikes/models/brochure/2009/6-08hybridbroch.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Giant Twist</a>&nbsp;are more like traditional bicycles with an electric motor that assists your pedaling.&nbsp; On bikes like the Twist the rider does more of the work with a little help from the motor.&nbsp; On bikes like the A2B the bike does more of the work - pedaling is an option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say, it was a ton of fun to ride the A2B last week.&nbsp; It came at a great time for me, as well.&nbsp; My normal commute is about 5.5 miles each way, but I was getting over the flu and had little energy to pedal.&nbsp; A2B to the rescue!&nbsp; I used the electric bike for my commute last week without exerting all that energy.&nbsp; Plus, I was still able to be outside (which is great when you are getting over being sick) and was afforded the freedom to come and go on my own schedule.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ride is smooth, too.&nbsp; Full front and rear suspension absorbed all the bumps and wide tires give the bike good stability -&nbsp;unlike a traditional bicycle, however,&nbsp;the tires were less than ideal for tight turning.&nbsp; A comfortable saddle and upright riding position kept my chest open and made breathing easier.&nbsp; And the bike's design&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;simple to get on and off by allowing your&nbsp;feet&nbsp;to easily reach the ground (no tippy toes!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I enjoyed the A2B.&nbsp; For someone looking for an electric scooter with bike lane and trail accessibility, go talk to the Bike Gallery staff to see if it's right for you.</p>

News,537028,News Release: PBOT prepares to install 24 pedestrian safety beacons in East Portland; Educational brochures being distributed in multiple languages,1,,2015-07-09 17:34:20 UTC,2015-07-09 17:31:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(July 9, 2015) -&nbsp; To improve safety for pedestrians crossing busy East Portland streets, the Portland Bureau of Transportation will install 24 new Rapid Flash Beacons later this summer and fall at key crossings and is leading a new effort to raise community awareness about the beacons and their use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=537027"" alt=""RFB on 80th and Foster"" width=""350"" height=""233.333333333"" /></p>
<p>Over the next several weeks, the Bureau will distribute <a href=""/transportation/article/524763"">multi-lingual flyers</a> about the flashing beacons to community locations including libraries, social service agencies, health centers, and community centers.&nbsp; In addition, the Bureau has placed multi-lingual <a href=""/transportation/article/524725"">ads</a> in neighborhood newspapers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A driver is far more likely to stop for a pedestrian at crossings with beacons than without. These flashing lights can be a matter of life and death on busy, wide streets where the beacons will be installed,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;These beacons are a great example of the types of safety improvements that are needed to advance our<a href=""/transportation/40390""> Vision Zero</a> strategy&mdash; certainly in East Portland, but also throughout the entire city.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solar-powered LED beacons flash yellow when a pedestrian pushes a button, signaling drivers to stop and stay stopped to allow people to cross safely.&nbsp; They are being installed on streets that PBOT has designated as High Crash Corridors because of their safety needs. (See <a href=""/transportation/article/522936"">map</a> and <a href=""/transportation/article/530565"">listing</a> of the beacons.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact dates for activation will vary and the first beacons to come on line will be near two schools: NE 102<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and Skidmore near Prescott Elementary School and the west side of SE 122<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and Lincoln Street, near Mill Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These flashing beacons deliver a needed safety improvement to East Portland and allow residents of all ages and abilities to travel safely to their destinations.&nbsp; Shopping, going to work, taking transit, going to the park should not be a dangerous experience. These flashing beacons will make our East Portland streets safer,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk that requires motorists to stop for pedestrians, compliance levels vary and can be especially low on busy multi-lane streets such as those in East Portland.&nbsp; Another hazard on multi-lane streets occurs when a vehicle in one lane stops, but a vehicle in an adjacent lane doesn&rsquo;t. Such &ldquo;double threat&rdquo; incidents have led to several pedestrian deaths over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/resources/techsum/fhwasa09009/"">Federal Highway Administration</a> has found that these flashing beacons are highly effective at increasing driver yielding rates to pedestrians in crosswalks. An FHWA study showed that four out of five drivers stop at crossings when flashing beacons are triggered, versus one out of five at marked crosswalks without flashing beacons.</p>
<p>The <a href=""/transportation/article/522936"">new beacons</a> and related communications are part of PBOT's&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/40390"">Vision Zero</a> initiative to eliminate deaths and serious injuries from Portland&rsquo;s roadways.&nbsp; Building enhanced pedestrian crossings on busy roadways is a key strategy to achieving this vision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT first installed the devices as an experiment in 2010 on two High Crash Corridors - at SE Foster at SE 80th and SE 82nd Ave south of SE Francis - and quickly found them to be effective. When the 24 installations are complete in 2016, Portland will have 55 beacons throughout the city.</p>

News,537479,News Release: Director Treat announces PBOT surpasses Back to Basics goal to preserve 100 miles of streets,1,,2015-07-31 23:19:57 UTC,2015-07-14 17:02:00 UTC,A,,"<p><a href=""/transportation/article/537485""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=537484"" alt=""Back to Basics map"" width=""670"" height=""505.965517241"" /></a></p>

<p>(July 14, 2015) Transportation Director Leah Treat announced today that the Portland Bureau of Transportation surpassed its goal of preserving 100 lane miles of City streets during the budget year that ended June 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 103 miles preserved in fiscal year 2014-15 equals the total miles treated in the prior year, but represents more than double the lane miles of streets preserved in 2012-13.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayor Charlie Hales and Commissioner Steve Novick set the goal of 100 miles of street preservation two years ago and have continued their advocacy for more transportation investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basic maintenance is a smart investment because it saves money in the long run,&rdquo; said Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;If we spend a little money now to keep roads in good condition, more costly road rebuilds can be prevented and delayed. The Mayor and I set the 100 miles of preservation goal, and I&rsquo;m glad the transportation bureau is making it an annual tradition to surpass that goal, even with limited resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treat said that PBOT has its sights set on a third year of preserving 100 miles of streets in fiscal year 2015-16, which started July 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no longer an aspirational goal. This is business as usual for the City of Portland,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;Portland Progress, the two-year workplan that PBOT adopted in February, makes it clear that street preservation is fundamental to our mission as the steward of the City&rsquo;s transportation system. Our asset managers pick the right projects to preserve the system. And our maintenance crews work hard and always search for new techniques to get the job done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayor Hales and Commissioner Novick continue to make maintenance a high priority. They successfully advocated for a budget for 2015-16 includes the largest General Fund investment in transportation in 30 years. The Council approved $20 million more for basic transportation investments, for a total $29 million from the city&rsquo;s General Fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT uses a variety of treatments that help prevent potholes from occurring and save money. A fog seal preventive sealant costs at least $8,500 a lane mile. If PBOT waits for that same street to fall into poor condition, it could cost at least $1 million to $2 million to rebuild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crews preserved the 103 lane miles using a variety of street preservation techniques. In 2014-15, PBOT completed a total of 56 lane miles of grinding and repaving the street surface -- work that is mainly conducted on high-traffic streets. Crews treated 44 lane miles with fog seal, a technique used mainly on low-traffic neighborhood streets. On 3 lane miles, workers completed base repairs, in which they dig up, repair and repave badly damaged areas of streets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lane mile is one mile of street that is 12-feet wide. In 2015-16, PBOT expects to apply more crack sealing to arterial streets, as a way to extend the life of those streets and avoid more costly rebuilds and repaving projects. At a news conference on North Argyle Street, crews demonstrated how it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For every $15 million we invest in preventive maintenance, PBOT estimates the City can avoid at least $50 million a year in future costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We make the most of limited resources by doing the right work, at the right place, at the right time,&rdquo; Treat said.</p>

News,538053,"News Release: Citing safety and economic development benefits, Commissioner Novick welcomes back Naito Pilot Project during Oregon Brewers Festival",1,,2015-07-20 06:45:31 UTC,2015-07-17 17:50:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(July 17, 2015) &ndash; Commissioner Steve Novick and community partners today announced the <a href=""/transportation/67572"">Naito Pilot Project</a>, a temporary safety solution that will create a pleasant route for people to get to and enjoy the Oregon Brewers Festival (OBF) at Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Oregon Brewers Festival is one of several major summer events in Portland&rsquo;s waterfront park. The festival attracts some 85,000 visitors, with more than 30 percent coming from out of state. But to reach the festival, visitors and tourists are too often forced to walk in a bike lane, or bike in a travel lane with high-speed vehicle traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safety of residents and visitors is our top priority,&rdquo; said Novick, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s particularly true for events and festivals along the waterfront. We want everyone to have a great time, be safe and enjoy some of Oregon&rsquo;s finest beer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting Tuesday, July 21 at 6pm and lasting through Monday, July 27 at 6pm, the four-lane SW Naito Parkway will have three travel lanes, plus a lane of open space for the public to walk and bike safely to the festival. The pilot project will open nearly a mile of street, 15 feet wide, to public use, from SW Salmon Street to SW Ankeny. The Brewers Festival has in the past used parts of SW Naito for loading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pilot project will be similar to an opening of Naito conducted during the Rose Festival in June. To help keep visitors safe, Better Block PDX, a local group devoted to creating temporary public space, worked with PBOT to create the project. Better Block volunteers will build safety barriers and pedestrian lanes, monitor traffic, and count people walking and bicycling along the waterfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the Naito pilot project in June, people on bicycle will be able to travel in both directions of the public space. During the weekend, the northern end of the project will begin at SW Ash Street in order to facilitate Saturday Market activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Block is excited to continue the conversation about public space on our downtown waterfront that was started by Gov Tom McCall,&rdquo; said Ryan Hashagen, a volunteer with the group. &ldquo;The legacy of Gov. McCall and Waterfront Park has proven so successful and is often at peak capacity, Better Block PDX is happy to partner with Oregon Brewers Festival to create a safe space for all Oregonians to enjoy our downtown Waterfront.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transportation Director Leah Treat said PBOT is collaborating with the festival and Better Block on their request to create safer public access to the waterfront. &ldquo;We are eager to help create a safe, enjoyable experience for the thousands of people walking and biking to this great event,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with the City of Portland, Better Block PDX, Oregon Walks, and Portland State University to create a safe space for our patrons as they come to the waterfront to enjoy some of the best tasting beer in the world,&rdquo; said Art Larrance, director of the Oregon Brewers Festival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland State University engineering students designed traffic control measures for the project, which were reviewed by PBOT staff. &ldquo;For a university that strives every day to heed the motto, 'Let Knowledge Serve The City,' there is no clearer sign of success than a student project being brought to life in the heart of our city,"" said Wim Wiewel, president of PSU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An <a href=""/transportation/article/537987"">economic analysis</a> conducted by Eastern Oregon University during last year&rsquo;s festival found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women accounted for nearly half (44%) of OBF attendees.</li>
<li>Nearly half (42%) of the attendees utilized public transit to reach the festival.</li>
<li>41% of OBF patrons were attending the festival for the first time.</li>
<li>The largest demographic of attendees are 21-29 year olds (29%) followed by those over the age of 50 (25%).</li>
<li>290 jobs were created as a direct result of the economic impact of the Oregon Brew Festival.</li>

<p>The route loops along streets with neighborhood greenways markings and low speed limits for everyone to bike, stroll, roll, skate and play on traffic-free streets.&nbsp; The Sunday Parkways route also will connect Northeast Portland Parks &ndash; Fernhill, Woodlawn, Alberta- and Portland&rsquo;s newly added K&#688;unamokwst Park (pronounced KAHN-ah-mockst).</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways is a series of five free community events opening the city's largest public space &ndash; its streets &ndash; for people to walk, bike, and roll and discover active transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The event series, held in a different neighborhood once a month from May to September, is hugely popular; total attendance topped 108,000 last year.</p>
<p>By holding traffic-free Sunday Parkways on routes that include neighborhood greenways and connects parks, PBOT hopes to introduce people of all backgrounds to get out and get active every day.</p>
<p>The Northeast Portland event also features a Bilingual Bike Fair, presented in partnership with Andando en Bicicletas en Cully (ABC) Group, to provide bike helmet safety and bike repair advice in both English and Spanish, and to encourage more Hispanic families to join the event.&nbsp; The Bike Fair will be held at - K<sup>h</sup>unamokwst Park also from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp; All are welcome.</p>
<p>Luica Llanos Pino, a member of the ABC Group said the group was inspired by their partnership with the Community Cycling Center&rsquo;s bicycling program to come together to promote physical activity, community bonding and address social isolation for residents living in predominantly immigrant communities in Portland.</p>

<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">(July</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;23, 2015) &ndash; &nbsp;Commissioner Steve Novick today announced that the Portland Bureau of Transportation had surpassed two major milestones in the city&rsquo;s largest ever energy efficiency project: &nbsp;More than 20,000 city street lights have been converted to modern LED lights, and savings from the program have now topped $100,000 per month. Those monthly savings will continue to grow as more lights are converted.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-right""><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">The benefits don&rsquo;t stop there. Commissioner Novick and Transportation Bureau Director Leah Treat also accepted a ceremonial check of $817,490</span></span><span class=""s6""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">from Energy Trust of Oregon, which provides incentives and discounted pricing to government, businesses and residents to convert lights to energy-saving LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, a relatively new technology that has quickly taken hold in the energy marketplace. The check represents the incentives for the 20,000 LED streetlights installed to date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Plus, each neighborhood will benefit from street lights that last four times longer and provide reliable light for people&rsquo;s safe travels on our streets and sidewalks.&ldquo;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">The new LED street lights</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;use half the energy of the high-pressure sodium bulbs</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;they replace</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;and are expected to last up to 20 years. They also prevent about 10,500 tons of carbon pollution each year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to be working with the City to make a change that has such great benefits &ndash; both in cost and energy savings and in the safety and livability of neighborhoods,&rdquo; said Margie Harris, executive director, Energy Trust. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen a dramatic surge in both homes and businesses making the switch to LED lighting. Last year, 68 percent of our record high lighting savings in existing buildings came from LEDs, including indoor fixtures, street lighting, exterior fixtures and lamps.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">The news conference marked the halfway point in th</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">e city&rsquo;s conversion process.

As of this week</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">, 22,676 st</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">reet lights have been switched.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">Portland&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">City Council unanimously passed an ordinance</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;in December 2012 to authorize the conversion,</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;dedicating $18.5 million to the project from a general obligation bond. O</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">n</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">ce the project is complete, the City can expect to save $1.5 million a year in maintenance and energy costs</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">.</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">At that rate, the project will pay for itself in eight years. At the direction of City Council, future years&rsquo; savings will be used as a sustainable revenue stream for street light maintenance, purchasing green energy, and to finance the next round of upgrades about 20 years from now. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">The $1.5 million annual savings is a conservative estimate and actual savings may be higher, said&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">PBOT&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;I am pleased that the sav</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">ings</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;may exceed our projections. &nbsp;I am also pleased by how the new street lights deliver benefits to each neighborhood, to our city as a whole and to our effo</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">rts to address climate change.&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">We are making a difference street by street and light by light.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Green dots show lights that have been installed; red indicates lights that will be converted. The map also allows the public to send in questions and feedback on each street light.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">The new LED street lights are easily identifiable: they cast a crisp light similar to moonlight, unlike&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">the yellow-tinged light from high-pressure sodium bulbs.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">Many other cities are making</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;the switch</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;to save both money and energy, including</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle as well as</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">Portland&rsquo;s</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;nearby neighbors</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">Gresham, Lake Oswego, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Clackamas County and Milwaukie</span></span><span class=""s7""><span class=""bumpedFont15"">.</span></span></p>

<p>While Portland already boasts one of the highest bike commute rates in the country, many Sunday Parkways participants are new to biking, with some dusting off bicycles that have been stored in garages or basements for years. Without these wonderful organizations, basic mechanical issues such flat tires, rusty chains, and sticky brakes would keep many participants from experiencing the thrill of Sunday Parkways.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.bikegallery.com/"">Bike Gallery</a> has been a major contributor since the beginning, participating at every single Sunday Parkways since the first one in 2008 &ndash; that&rsquo;s 32 Sunday Parkways so far! They continue to support each event with a booth for free repairs.</p>
<p>Over the years, other shops and community organizations have joined us to provide bike repair services to participants. Bikes for Humanity and Bike Farm are both non-profit groups that help get more participants out enjoying Sunday Parkways by bike who otherwise may not be able to. <br /> <br /><a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/bikes4humanity/""><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=539707"" alt=""Kids waiting their turn for a bike repair"" width=""250"" height=""176.25"" />Bikes for Humanity PDX</a> provides affordable refurbished bicycles to riders of all economic backgrounds. They also provide training, tools and shop space for volunteers to learn to work on refurbishing donated bikes. Bikes for Humanity volunteers were at Alberta Park on Sunday and were busy all day.</p>
<p>The mission at <a href=""http://bikefarm.org/"">Bike Farm</a> is to provide a space where people can learn about the bicycle and build community around promoting sustainable transportation. Bike Farm is a do-it-yourself bike shop staffed entirely by volunteers who help guide patrons in learning and doing their own bike repair.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways is all about opening Portland streets for neighbors to walk, bike, roll and discover active, healthy transportation. Our recent Northeast event on Sunday, July 26 brought over 22,000 participants out to enjoy a fantastic day &ndash; even with a few sprinkles near the end of the afternoon.

News,540632,Added safety improvements completed along SW Moody,1,,2015-08-07 17:21:15 UTC,2015-08-07 17:18:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""summary""><strong>West sidewalk and cycletrack reopened in South Waterfront&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(August 7, 2015) Added safety improvements along SW Moody Avenue have been completed between SW Sheridan Street and the Ross Island Bridge area, allowing the west sidewalk and cycletrack to re-open Friday, Aug. 7. TriMet and the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) completed three weeks of work to improve the flow of pedestrians and bicyclists along SW Moody Avenue.</p>
<p>With the recent addition of MAX Orange Line trains, and more buses and streetcars traveling in South Waterfront, TriMet and PBOT closely monitored the heavy flow of pedestrians and bicyclists along SW Moody. The agencies saw unsafe behavior including crossing against signals and not looking for trains and buses coming from opposite directions. Based on those observations, adjustments were made to further encourage people to cross the tracks safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we begin operating along a new alignment we see how people behave around our vehicles and tracks, and then make adjustments to improve safety,&rdquo; said TriMet Safety and Security Executive Director Harry Saporta. &ldquo;Those improvements will help people be more aware and alert of trains and buses along the new Orange Line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The improvements also allow bicyclists and pedestrians to better share the space and improve access to the Collaborative Life Sciences Building and Tilikum Crossing,<em>Bridge of the People,</em>&nbsp;when it opens in September.</p>

<p>On the west side of SW Moody the configuration of the cycletrack and sidewalk changed and is now consistent along the entire stretch between Sheridan Street and the Ross Island Bridge area:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Pedestrians shift to the west side of the pathway away from the traffic lanes.</li>
<li>Bicyclists traveling north and south share the section of pathway closest to the curb.</li>
<li>Additional green paint and striping was added to delineate how each mode shares the space.</li>
<li>Railings were added around the southbound Portland Streetcar stop at SW Moody &amp; Meade.</li>
<li>Some crossing signals were adjusted for improved safety.</li>
</ul>

News,540776,News Release: The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) releases statement regarding Cale Group’s Open Letter to Customers,1,,2015-08-10 18:42:05 UTC,2015-08-10 18:40:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(August 10, 2015) This May, federal prosecutors released documents indicating that in 2006 George Levey, the owner of a former independent distributor of Cale parking meters, copied some of his employees on emails describing Levey&rsquo;s efforts to secure Portland&rsquo;s parking meter business with the inside help of then-parking manager Ellis McCoy. Subsequently, those employees went to work for Cale America, the company that currently holds the contract for the City&rsquo;s parking meters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the Cale Group, which includes Cale America, sent an open letter to its customers outlining the steps the company has taken and will take regarding the May revelations. These steps include a recently concluded internal investigation to determine whether any Cale Group employee was involved in or had knowledge of George Levey&rsquo;s illegal activities. The company has also undertaken management changes that mean two senior employees of Cale America who had previously worked for George Levey will no longer be with the Cale Group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company also announced that it will take several forward looking steps to sever any &ldquo;perceived connection&rdquo; to the past illegal activities of George Levey. These include a new code of conduct for Cale America employees; annual ethics, procurement and anti-corruption training for Cale America employees; and measures to increase transparency and accountability in the company&rsquo;s record retention process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT acknowledges the steps that the Cale Group has taken. PBOT is committed to transparency and to the integrity of the contracting process. Given this, PBOT will now take steps to review the Cale Group&rsquo;s process and findings. Through the City Attorney, PBOT has retained the law firm of Stoll Berne as outside counsel to undertake an independent legal review. The outcome of this review will help to determine PBOT&rsquo;s future actions regarding the Cale Group and its business with the City.</p>

Mackay/Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></span></span><br /><br />(August 17, 2015) Mayor Charlie Hales and Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick were joined by city leaders, representatives from Multnomah County and Metro, community members, as well as State Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer to launch the <a href=""/transportation/68398"">Vision Zero Safety Task Force</a>. Task Force members represent a broad coalition of organizations and agencies devoted to improved transportation infrastructure, public safety, education and public health. The Vision Zero Task Force is charged with developing a community action plan to dramatically reduce serious and fatal crashes on Portland&rsquo;s roads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is about commitment and cooperation,&rdquo; said Mayor Hales, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to announce our commitment to putting an end to fatal crashes on our roadways. We&rsquo;ll reach this broad goal by harnessing all of the energy and creativity of the agencies, groups and leaders represented in this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Novick noted the larger importance of advancing the Vision Zero initiative as a matter of creating more equitable neighborhoods.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you live in a low-income census tract within Multnomah County you are 2.3 times more likely to be killed walking,&rdquo; Novick stated. &ldquo;By committing to Vision Zero goals, not only will we make Portland a safer city, we&rsquo;ll also make it a more equitable community for all Portlanders in all neighborhoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also in attendance were State Senate Majority Leader Diane Rosenbaum, State Sen. Michael Dembrow and Metro Councilor Bob Stacey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mayor Hales emphasized that as the Task Force develops an action plan over the next year, the City will continue to take concrete steps to make Portland roads safer. He highlighted steps that the Portland Police and the Portland Fire and Rescue will take in the coming months. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investments in pedestrian safety.</strong> PBOT will begin work on significant safety projects on three High Crash Corridors, including a new streetscape for SE Foster Road, and new sidewalk, crossings, and transit access improvements along 122nd and Burnside. Additionally, the Bureau will install 22 pedestrian crossing improvements in East Portland utilizing Rapid Flashing Beacons over the coming year.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Targeted enforcement of dangerous speeding.</strong> Working with the Portland Bureau of Transportation, the Portland Police will target speed enforcement and education activities on some of Portland&rsquo;s most dangerous roads.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>New data sharing initiative.</strong> The Bureau of Fire and Rescue Fire will work with the Transportation and Police bureaus to develop a new crash data sharing initiative. The goal is to harness the power of data to deliver more targeted safety interventions on Portland&rsquo;s roadways.</li>
</ul>
<p>Director Leah Treat, who brought the idea of Vision Zero to Portland when she took over PBOT&rsquo;s helm in 2013, stressed the steps the Bureau is already taking to make Vision Zero a reality. &ldquo;Vision Zero is a pillar of our work plan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and thanks to the $29 million in funds that Mayor Hales and Commissioner Novick secured for the bureau, we are already implementing key roadway improvements on our most dangerous streets, including 122<sup>nd</sup> Avenue in East Portland and on Burnside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As first responders, police arrive on the scene of many crashes, and see the impact it has on those involved, their families and the community,&rdquo; said Chief Lawrence P. O&rsquo;Dea, III. &ldquo;In most cases, these crashes were preventable, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m hopeful that with our Vision Zero partners, we can work together to reduce crashes and keep all users of our streets safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Kick-off the Task Force&rsquo;s Executive Committee met and outlined the broad work agenda and goals that each Task Force member will pursue during the year. The full Task Force will meet on September 10 to begin its work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Vision Zero:</strong> Vision Zero is an innovative transportation safety initiative that sets the goal of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries from the transportation system. Vision Zero rejects the notion that traffic crashes are simply &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; but instead preventable incidents that can and must be systematically addressed. In July, the Portland City Council voted unanimously to adopt Vision Zero&rsquo;s goal that no loss of life is acceptable on city streets as official City policy. <a href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/"">www.visionzeroportland.com</a></p>

<p>Mayor Charlie Hales will join in the fun beginning at Portland Sunday Parkways&rsquo; new park &ndash; Sewallcrest Park at SE 31st Avenue and SE Stephens Street at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Sunday Parkways gives every family a chance to experience our community&rsquo;s creative place-making,&rdquo; Mayor Hales said. &ldquo;It shows off the best of what makes Portland a great city to live, travel and play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though it is organized by the Portland Bureau of Transportation, City bureaus will participate in this wildly popular event to say hello and provide information to residents and visitors alike. At the Mayor&rsquo;s first stop in Sewallcrest Park, the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability will have its Climate Action station. Riding clockwise, the next stop will be Colonel Summers Park where the Portland Fire &amp; Rescue trucks will be on hand for some CPR instruction and the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management will talk about preparedness. Continuing on to Laurelhurst Park, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation climbing wall and slip and slide will be on hand. Last stop will be Ivon Park with the Portland Water Bureau water station. And of course, PBOT will be at all parks with walking and biking information.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways is a series of five free community events opening Portland&rsquo;s largest public space &ndash; its streets &ndash; for people to walk, bike, and roll and discover active transportation.&nbsp; The event series, held in a different neighborhood once a month from May to September, is hugely popular; total attendance topped 108,000 in 2014.</p>
<p>By holding traffic-free Sunday Parkways on routes that include neighborhood greenways and connect parks, PBOT hopes to encourage people of all backgrounds to get out and get active every day. Neighborhood greenway streets are designed with bike markings and low speed limits for everyone to bike, stroll, roll, skate and play on traffic-free streets.&nbsp; The Aug. 23 Sunday Parkways route connects four Southeast Portland Parks &ndash; Sewallcrest, Colonel Summers, Laurelhurst, and Ivon Parks.</p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s detailed <a href=""/transportation/article/537055"">Sunday Parkways route map</a> shows the route as well as bus and light rail options to help area residents get to Sunday Parkways via bike and public transit.

Especially during school drop off and pick up hours, people who bicycle on N Flint may consider using N Vancouver and Williams, respectively. &nbsp;(<a href=""/transportation/article/542535"">See map</a>.)</p>
<p>Portland Public Schools (PPS) is relocating Faubion PK-8 to the former&nbsp;site of the&nbsp;Harriet Tubman Leadership Academy for Young Women&nbsp;at 2231 N Flint Avenue for two years while <a href=""http://www.pps.k12.or.us/bond/8497.htm"">Faubion is completely rebuilt</a> with proceeds from the School Improvement Bond.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) Safe Routes to School program, PPS continues to conduct outreach with families and people bicycling on Flint about the projected traffic uptick. According to PPS, over 40 people stopped at a bike breakfast event held last week to inform travelers about the changes. PPS is conducting training with bus drivers about maneuvering in a highly bicycle trafficked area.</p>
<p>In the fall 2014 Safe Routes to School survey, <a href=""/transportation/article/515317"">over 40% of Faubion families reported their students walked, biked or rolled to school</a>.

They form the backbone of the city's safe routes to school network and they make up a large portion of the low-stress bikeway network. <em><a href=""/transportation/article/542728"">Portland's Neighborhood Greenways Assessment Report</a></em>&nbsp;evaluated how the routes are working, their role in the city&rsquo;s transportation system, and what changes could be made both on the ground and in city policies to improve them. City council accepted the report and resolution unanimously.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" title=""Neighborhood greenway cargo bike picture"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=542746"" alt=""Neighborhood greenway cargo bike picture"" width=""300"" height=""400"" />The first neighborhood greenways were built more than 25 years ago, principally as neighborhood traffic calming projects. They have undergone several design changes through the years and some of the older neighborhood greenways, such as SE Clinton and SE Salmon, operate differently than some of the most recently built routes.</p>
<p>Neighborhood greenways are an important part of our city and our transportation system. In recent years, many community members have expressed concerns about the conditions of neighborhood greenways, particularly that they don&rsquo;t feel safe using them. PBOT staff undertook the neighborhood greenways assessment report to better understand the issues community members were expressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report helps quantify and illuminate the issues presented to PBOT and provides clear guidance on how staff should address problems expressed by the community. The report includes guidelines for how neighborhood greenways should operate so that these priority bicycle routes are predictable and consistent for all roads users throughout the city.</p>
<p>Promisingly, the data analysis in the report shows that most neighborhood greenways are functioning very well &ndash; they are well used by bicyclists, they have few cars and the speeds are slow. However, there are a few small, critical sections where the number and speeds of automobiles is compromising the street&rsquo;s comfort and safety.</p>
<p>The report puts forth six neighborhood greenways in need of operational improvements where auto speeds and volumes are too high. When funding becomes available, this list will help the city prioritize where to spend limited funds to bring existing neighborhood greenways up to the guidelines. This list does not impact the five currently funded projects that will continue to move forward, including three projects in East Portland, and two north-south neighborhood greenways in North and NE and SE Portland, respectively.</p>

<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=543702"" alt=""APWA Public Works Project of the Year Award 2015"" width=""300"" height=""340.650406504"" />The Balch Gulch Bridge at NW Thurman Street Rehabilitation Project was awarded the APWA Project of the Year in the Historical Restoration/Preservation category at a cost less than $5 million. The bridge is 110 years old and is a noteworthy historic and engineering treasure, built during the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition and World&rsquo;s Trade Fair as a gateway to Portland&rsquo;s developing Willamette Heights neighborhood. It is Oregon&rsquo;s oldest intact bridge, and is one of only few remaining of its type in the nation.</p>
<p>At the reopening celebration on October 10, 2014, Commissioner Novick said,&nbsp;&ldquo;Not only does the Thurman Street Bridge have a great historic legacy, it is a hallmark of the surrounding neighborhood. Through well-coordinated collaboration of multiple City bureaus and government agencies, we were able to preserve the historic character of the bridge while modernizing it to meet today&rsquo;s needs.""</p>
<p>The rehabilitation project exemplifies the integration of contemporary uses and systems for an out-of-date structure without compromising function or historic preservation. The decision to preserve the historic bridge was inspired not only by the public and government agencies, but also by the Bridges and Structures Group at Portland's Bureau of Transportation. The age of the bridge and its poor condition, its unique characteristics, and its special place in Portland history, as well as its eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places, made the rehabilitation of the Balch Gulch Bridge the only viable option. Federal-aid funds were sought and obtained, and after a local agency match, the total project budget was approximately $4 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=543703"" alt=""Thurman Street bridge with trolley"" width=""300"" height=""194.173728814"" />Before the rehabilitation, City engineers placed restrictions intended to slow the bridge&rsquo;s deterioration. Fire trucks were prohibited from using it, so Portland Fire &amp; Rescue emergency responders had to use a longer route to enter the neighborhood.</p>
<p>With the rehabilitation complete, the weight restriction has been lifted and fire trucks can now cross the bridge. By regaining the use of the NW Thurman Street Bridge, the response time for Portland Fire &amp; Rescue Emergency Operations has improved in many areas of the the neighborhood by over 4 minutes!</p>

<p>Restoration and rehabilitation of the bridge began in April 2014 with the goals: to lift the weight restriction without replacing the historic trusses; rehabilitate the bridge&rsquo;s deteriorated superstructure while maintaining and honoring the historic aesthetics of the bridge; restore the original appearance of the 1905 historic bridge handrail, but strengthen it to meet modern safety standards; design the modern steel floor beams to match the shape of the deteriorated historic riveted steel beams; replace the deteriorated wood deck and riveted steel beams, while shoring the historic trusses in place; and ensure that Macleay Park would remain open to the public during construction.</p>
<p>The completely restored and modernized Balch Gulch Bridge at NW Thurman Street was reopened to the public October 10, 2014 during a celebration hosted by Commissioner Steve Novick and the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>

News,544093,News Release: City Club of Portland affirms urgent need for a new funding source for transportation maintenance and safety,1,,2015-09-09 18:28:47 UTC,2015-09-09 18:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Sept. 9, 2015) &ndash; The City Club of Portland today released a report, &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s Streets: End the Funding Gridlock,&rdquo; a detailed analysis of the City&rsquo;s critical transportation maintenance and safety needs. The report calls for &ldquo;an immediate source of funds to prevent streets from falling into further disrepair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cities across the country face similar struggles in maintaining infrastructure, the report says. The federal government has not raised the gas tax in more than 20 years, even as construction costs have doubled, eroding the purchasing power of federal funds. The City&rsquo;s general fund pays for many core City services such as police, fire and parks and there is not enough revenue to also pay for streets without significant cuts to those other priorities, the report says. Facing similar circumstances, other 22 Oregon cities and counties have enacted local gas taxes, 30 have implemented a transportation utility fee and two have done both. Portland has neither its own gas tax nor a transportation fee.</p>
<p>The report says:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Portland is at the vanguard of this diversification of mobility and needs to adequately fund streets in order to maintain its position of leadership.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Portland needs money to fix its streets. The money must come from multiple sources because there is no plausible federal or state revenue stream large enough to fill Portland&rsquo;s need, none of the potential local funding mechanisms alone can fill the hole, and there is not enough money in the general fund to cover all costs.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Preventing death and serious injury, particularly among our most vulnerable road users, is unquestionably a primary obligation of a city&rsquo;s transportation system. Like road paving, safety improvements will need to be funded through a variety of sources, including any new transportation-specific revenue raised by the city.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate the City Club&rsquo;s thorough look at transportation maintenance and safety needs,&rdquo; said Maurice Henderson, Assistant Director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;PBOT is committed to responsible asset management and working towards our Vision Zero goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries. We look forward to the City Club&rsquo;s discussion and vote on Friday, and we will continue to provide information on this important issue to the club, our colleagues in city government and community groups from across Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday, City Engineer Steve Townsen will discuss maintenance and safety needs on a panel discussion hosted by the City Club at its Friday Forum. The event will be held at the Sentinel Hotel, 614 SW 11th Avenue. Doors open at 11:30 a.m.; program begins at 12:15 p.m.</p>

News,544356,"News Release: Commissioner Novick, Mayor Hales and Commissioner Fish announce next generation bike share proposal for Portland",1,,2015-09-10 18:12:00 UTC,2015-09-10 18:11:00 UTC,A,,"<p>PORTLAND, OR (September 9, 2015) &mdash; Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick, Mayor Charlie Hales and Commissioner Nick Fish announced an innovative bike share system for Portland. The proposed system will be operated by Motivate LLC, the nation&rsquo;s leading bike share operator. Bicycles will be provided by Social Bicycles, a company on the cutting-edge of integrating new software and hardware technology into its products. The proposal will be considered by City Council on Wednesday, September 16th.</p>
<p>Together, the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Motivate and Social Bicycles have designed one of smartest, large-scale bike share systems in the nation. This&nbsp;<em>smart bike</em>&nbsp;technology &ndash; which puts all communications and locking technology on the bike itself &ndash; will allow Portland&rsquo;s system to operate with fewer docks and kiosks. This will save money and allow users to lock bicycles at many existing city bike corrals. The technology will also allow the City and Motivate to pilot an innovative approach to rebalancing bicycles that will reduce the reliance on rebalancing vehicles. This will help to make Portland&rsquo;s bike share system one of the greenest in the nation. Overall, the system will make it substantially easier to find, reserve and park a bike.</p>
<p>The proposed initial system of 600 bikes is one of the most affordable bike sharing systems in the United States. The system also integrates principles of the High Road Standards that prioritizes accessibility to underserved communities and includes training and hiring opportunities for living-wage careers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This proposed contract is a great business decision for Portland,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working with the leading bike share company in the country. As Motivate has proven in New York, Chicago, Boston and Washington DC, bike share systems provide a valuable transportation amenity for residents and tourists alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this next generation bike share system, Portland has once again shown why we&rsquo;re the country&rsquo;s best city for bicycling,&rdquo; said Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;The proposed system will be one of the country&rsquo;s most technologically sophisticated and environmentally sustainable. It&rsquo;s a system that Portlanders can be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been a proud supporter of bike share since 2011,&rdquo; said Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;It will provide another healthy and sustainable transportation choice. Congratulations to Steve and Leah on reaching this important milestone for Portland bike share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing bike share to Portland is one of my top priorities,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, Director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;Bike share is a very effective way to raise the visibility of bicycling and to encourage new people, especially women, to try biking as a transportation option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More choices to get around means less time in traffic and more access to opportunity,&rdquo; said Metro Councilor Sam Chase. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to see bike share become yet another great option for people in this region, particularly with this system&rsquo;s commitment to affordability and equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motivate CEO Jay Walder said, &ldquo;Portland is one of the best bike cities in the country, and we&rsquo;re tremendously excited to be a part of expanding bicycling in a community with such a robust bike culture. We think that the City that has been on the cutting edge of bike innovation deserves one of the most innovative bike share system in the nation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executive Director of Oregon Tradeswomen Inc., Connie Ashbrook, championed the proposal by saying, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited about the employment opportunities that Portland&rsquo;s bike share system will offer our graduates. &nbsp;It will also provide our students and graduates an affordable, flexible transportation choice.&rdquo; Oregon Tradeswomen, Inc. is a non-profit that prepares low income women for high-wage, high-skilled construction careers.</p>
<p>The cost of the bicycles will be funded with $2 million in federal grants allocated through Metro&rsquo;s regional flexible funds process. User revenues and anticipated sponsor support will pay for operating the system. No City money will be used for bike share operations.</p>
<p>City Council will consider the proposed bike share system in its morning session on Wednesday, September 16th.</p>
<p>About Bike Share:&nbsp;A bike share system makes public bicycles available to ride from one point to another for a small fee. Bike share systems operate in over 60 US cities, including New York, Chicago, Washington DC, San Antonio, Indianapolis, Boise and Austin. 500 cities worldwide also have bike share systems. These systems have proved popular, safe and successful. They provide residents and visitors a convenient and fun transportation option for trips around the city. Bike share systems have proven effective in introducing bicycling to new groups of riders.</p>

<p>(Sept. 22, 2015) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau advise the traveling public that a crosswalk education and enforcement action is scheduled for Wednesday, Sept. 23 at the marked crosswalk on NE Glisan Street, west of 130th Place from 9:30 to 11 a.m. to raise awareness of traffic safety and Oregon traffic laws, and emphasize school safety. Please note the time for this event has changed: An announcement last week indicated the event would be 7 to 8:30 a.m., but the time has been changed to coincide with a late-start day for nearby Menlo Park Elementary School.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=545000"" alt=""Vision Zero Logo"" width=""189"" height=""189"" />Education and enforcement actions such as the Sept. 23 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>The start of September means school is back in session or about to begin for thousands of children and families. When driving, people should anticipate seeing more children going to and from school and be prepared to drive the posted 20 mph speed or less when in designated school zones. Children are often smaller and more difficult to see, so people driving should continually scan their environment looking for children in the crossing or about to cross and be prepared to stop. If you're a parent, consider walking or biking to school with your students where possible to reduce congestion, improve safety and provide young people with needed physical activity.</p>

<p>This NE Glisan Street and west of 130<sup>th</sup> Place location was selected because of the proximity to Menlo Park Elementary School and the City&rsquo;s efforts to bring more awareness about youth heading back-to-school and transportation safety.&nbsp;<br /><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=545006"" alt=""Crosswalk on NE Glisan near 130th Place"" width=""391"" height=""194"" /></p>
<p class=""content-left"">Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving cars must stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when the person walking is in the motor lane or the adjacent lane (motor lane plus 6 feet on either side when the driver is making a turn at a traffic signal). A bike lane and a parking lane are an extension of the adjacent travel lane. ORS 811.028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each crosswalk education and enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian walking across the street at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, biking and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. People driving who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and people walking across the street who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

<p>An estimated 23,347 Portlanders commuted to work by bike in 2014, an increase of 27 percent, or 5,010 commuters from the year before.</p>
<p>""Two of the greatest threats we face are climate disruption and rising health care costs,"" said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. ""Bicycles are potent weapons against both threats, because when you're riding a bike, you're getting healthier and you're not emitting greenhouse gases. Many people understand that, but assume that only a tiny fraction of people will ever ride a bike. But that's not true. The numbers can grow -- and now we know that they are growing.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portlanders should be proud that we continue to use bikes at the highest rate of any major city in the nation,&rdquo; said Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s record rate of bike commuting is a result of decades of investment in projects that make it safer for people to use bikes and programs that encourage people to try biking. When we make it safer for people to bike, we all benefit with cleaner air, lower carbon emissions and a healthier community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2013, Portland had a bike commute rate of 5.9 percent and in 2004 the rate was 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from the Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2014 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimate. The 5,010 increase in bike commuters exceeds the margin of error by 2,050.

News,545853,News Release: New Portland Sunday Parkways route connects Tilikum Crossing: Bridge of the People and Westmoreland Park Salmon Celebration,1,,2015-09-24 00:31:31 UTC,2015-09-23 23:49:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong></strong><strong><em>Final Portland Sunday Parkways of the Season Coming up this Sunday, Sept. 27</em></strong></p>
<p>(Sept. 23, 2015) &ndash; The season&rsquo;s final City of Portland Sunday Parkways presented by Kaiser Permanente will take place this Sunday, Sept. 27&nbsp;from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Participants will have the opportunity to enjoy a brand new route that will feature the stunning addition to Portland&rsquo;s cityscape: Tilikum Crossing.</p>
<p>The 8-mile route in Southeast Portland will allow residents to explore many of the pathways, sidewalks, ramps, bridges and crosswalks that have been designed to make it easy to get from the beautiful neighborhoods of Sellwood up to the Tilikum Crossing.</p>
<p>Participants will also have the chance to try out various outdoor activities at Sellwood and Brooklyn School Parks. At the newly finished Westmoreland Park Nature Play Area, participants can enjoy the Salmon Celebration in honor of the return of wild salmon to the city.&nbsp;Salmon have come back thanks to the restoration of Crystal Springs Creek to its natural flow, a joint project by the City and US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>Food vendors, organizations and businesses will be on hand at all four activity areas/parks, offering something for everyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three unique things about Portland: Our amazing neighborhoods; our stunning collection of parks; and the willingness of Portlanders to get out of their cars and meet their neighbors,&rdquo; said Portland Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;These are our shared values of livability and equity, and nothing says it better than Sunday Parkways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very excited by this new route,&rdquo; said Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Bringing Sunday Parkways and Tilikum Crossing together is a perfect combination and expresses our City&rsquo;s commitment to be a city that encourages all transportation modes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When people discover just how much fun it is to walk, bike, roll, skate, and stroll and how easy it is be physically active during Sunday Parkways, they are choosing to experience &ldquo;Sunday Parkways Every Day&rdquo; &ndash; walking to the store, riding with their families, playing in the parks and commuting by bike to work. New figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show that<a href=""/transportation/article/545295""> Portland set a new, national record</a> for bike commuting in 2014, with 7.2 percent of commuters choosing to bike to work and incorporate physical activity into their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways is a series of five free community events opening the city's largest public space &ndash; its streets &ndash; for people to walk, bike, and roll and discover active transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The event series, held in a different neighborhood once a month from May to September, is hugely popular and is poised to break its all-time attendance record of 108,900 participants that rode their bikes, walked, strolled, rolled and enjoyed these traffic-free and fun streets back in 2014.</p>
<p>Neighbors on the route will be able to get to and from their homes during the event with the assistance of pink-shirted Sunday Parkways volunteers who will guide them safely to and from their driveways. Police and traffic flaggers will be on hand to keep traffic moving across the route at designated route crossings throughout the event.</p>
<p>The event&rsquo;s <a href=""/transportation/article/543028"">detailed Sunday Parkways route map</a> &nbsp;shows the route as well as bus, streetcar and light rail options to help area residents get to Sunday Parkways via bike and transit.

<p>(Sept. 24, 2015) &ndash; This afternoon, Mayor Charlie Hales, Commissioners Steve Novick and Nick Fish gathered at City Hall with Metro Councilor Sam Chase, Jay Walder, President and CEO of Motivate, and Ryan Rzepecki, the CEO of Social Bicycles, to celebrate the passage of Portland&rsquo;s bike share by the City Council and other major milestones in Portland bicycling. This milestones include recent US Census data showing that Portlanders set a bike commuting record in 2014 and City-compiled data demonstrating high bicycling rates among women and more persistent bike use by all bicycle commuters.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=545967"" alt=""Mayor Hales at Bike Share news conference"" width=""527"" height=""352"" /></p>
<p>Passing unanimously, the bike share measure amends the City&rsquo;s contract with Motivate, the country&rsquo;s leading bike share operator. Working with Social Bicycles, Motivate will bring a next generation bike share program to Portland in summer 2016 and expand the transit options available to Portlanders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new system will feature 600 smart bicycles that will be available across the Central City and inner North Portland. With all of the communications and locking technology contained on the bicycles, Portland&rsquo;s system will operate with fewer docking stations and kiosks and make it easier to find, reserve and park a bike. The system will also have one of the lowest price points in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starting this summer, Portlanders will have another way to get around our great city,&rdquo; said Mayor Charlie Hales, &ldquo;one that is easy to use, affordable and, best of all, a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited a long time for the right bike share proposal, but it was worth the wait,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;We have a great, experienced partner in Motivate; and we are taking advantage of new &lsquo;smart bike&rsquo; technology. Bicycles are great weapons against two of the biggest threats we face: climate disruption and rising health care costs. Bike share is a great addition to our arsenal - and it's also an important tourist amenity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look forward to signing up for bike share in Portland,&rdquo; said Commissioner Fish.&nbsp; &ldquo;What could be better than getting healthy while running errands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bike share is just the latest in a long list of innovations that set this region apart. Metro is proud of our role in making Portland&rsquo;s vision a reality. I can&rsquo;t wait to try bike share next year,&rdquo; said Metro Councilor Sam Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is one of the best bike cities in the country, and we&rsquo;re tremendously excited to be a part of expanding bicycling in a community with such a robust bike culture,"" said Jay Walder, President &amp; CEO of Motivate. ""We will deliver&nbsp;one of the most innovative bike share systems in the nation, fitting the city that has been on the cutting edge of bike innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""Social Bicycles is excited to partner with Motivate and the City of Portland to deliver bike share to one of the country's most bicycle and transit friendly communities,&rdquo; said Social Bicycles CEO Ryan Rzepecki. &ldquo;We believe Portland has the infrastructure, bike culture, and density to become one of the most successful programs in the world.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a great week for bicycling,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Census data and our own bike count clearly show that Portlanders are biking more than ever. Now with bike share, we&rsquo;re making biking an even more attractive transportation option for Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""Today we are thrilled to invite bike share into Portland as a new low-cost form of transit,&rdquo; said Rob Sadowsky, Executive Director of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance. &ldquo;In fact, it is one of the most affordable steps we can take to help us reach Portland&rsquo;s stated goal of having bicycle trips represent 25 percent of all trips taken by 2030. Bike share, combined with new investments downtown to provide protected bicycle lanes, will make our streets safer for everyone regardless of how they get around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also today, PBOT released the Portland Bicycle Count Report 2013-14, a compendium of locally collected bicycle data that shows how bicycling is changing and growing across Portland. While the U.S. Census Bureau reports on citywide bicycle use, the Bicycle Count report includes data for bike traffic on Willamette River bridges, bike traffic by district within Portland, helmet use by district and bicycle use by women.</p>
<p>Findings include:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Bicycle use by women climbed to 32 percent in 2014, a record high for Portland. Inner NE Portland had the highest rate of women riders with 35 percent and East Portland had the lowest with 21 percent.</li>
<li>Portlanders are biking more persistently throughout the year. Data compiled by the bike counter on the Hawthorne Bridge show weekday bicycle use remains at an average of 90 percent of peak July use for seven months of the year, from April to October. In the more seasonally challenging months, bike use remains at an average 54 percent of the peak.</li>
<li>In 2014, peak summer bicycle trips across the bicycle-friendly Willamette River bridges topped 20,000 weekday trips for the first time, according to the City&rsquo;s hand counts and automated counts where available.</li>
<li>In 2014, helmet use hit the highest recorded rate at 81 percent, up from 78 percent in 2013 and 71 percent in 2004.</li>

<p>Vehicle exhaust is hazardous to human health, especially for children. It&rsquo;s linked to increased rates of cancer, heart and lung disease and asthma. Children, whose lungs are still developing, breathe more rapidly and inhale more pollutants per pound of body mass than adults.</p>
<p>Vehicle exhaust is the leading source of toxic air pollution in Oregon. Nearly half of toxic air pollutants in Oregon come from vehicles releasing sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and other toxins that contribute to carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.</p>
<p>Idling is also expensive and hard on your engine. Ten seconds of idling uses more fuel than restarting your engine and just one hour of idling burns about one gallon of gas with zero miles per gallon. Finally, an idling engine is not working at peak temperature so fuel doesn&rsquo;t fully combust, causing damage to engine parts.</p>
<p>What can you do?<br />&bull; <strong>Turn it off</strong> &ndash; if you are going to be stopped for more than 10 seconds (especially around schools and where children live and play)<br />&bull; <strong>Reduce warm up idling</strong> &ndash; modern engines don&rsquo;t need more than 30 seconds of idling to warm up<br />&bull; <strong>Spread the word</strong> &ndash; talk to family, friends and neighbors about the benefits of reduced idling and encourage them to join you in contributing to a healthier community and in saving money</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/546379

<p><em>By Dylan Rivera,&nbsp;</em><em>PBOT staff</em></p>
<p>(Sept. 28, 2015) An estimated 28,000 people participated in the Tilikum Crossing-Sellwood Sunday Parkways on Sunday, helping lift the event to an annual record turnout of 119,000 for 2015.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=546401"" alt=""Sunday Parkways children on bikes near bridge"" width=""432"" height=""365.87755102"" />Great weather and the landmark opening of the Tilikum Crossing: Bridge of the People provided a huge draw for the event Sunday Sept. 27.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways introduces Portlanders to biking as a transportation option by opening miles of streets to biking, walking and rolling. The routes are designed to introduce new bicyclists to neighborhood greenways, the low-traffic residential streets where the Portland Bureau of Transportation has prioritized safe, comfortable access for people riding bicycles. The events also offer an opportunity for residents to connect with each other, by volunteering their time to help with traffic, distribute refreshments and spread the word about community organizations.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s 28,000 participants marked among the largest Sunday Parkways events. Only five of the 33 events held since 2008 have had a higher turnout. The highest was 31,500 at the North Portland Parkways event in 2011.</p>
<p>Growth in Sunday Parkways attendance in East Portland helped produce the record turnout this year, said Linda Ginenthal, who leads Sunday Parkways for the Active Transportation Division of PBOT. Attendance there has grown from 12,000 in 2010 to more than 16,000 this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we have done more community outreach in East Portland, there are more people who are riding and coming out to enjoy it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has built on the investments we&rsquo;re making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Volunteers and sponsors make Sunday Parkways possible. About a third of the budget for the event, which takes place five times a year, comes from the City of Portland. The balance is funded by sponsorships, led by presenting sponsor Kaiser Permanente, as well as fees for participating organizations and businesses and donations from individuals.<img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=546402"" alt=""Sunday Parkways volunteer shows woman a map"" width=""355"" height=""229.363213324"" /></p>
<p>About 300 to 400 people volunteer their time for each event. Wearing pink shirts, some direct traffic, helping neighbors access driveways along the route. Others talk with the public about community organizations. A handful of &ldquo;Superhero Coordinators&rdquo; ride up and down the route, passing out snacks and water to volunteers and giving them pointers as needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way we can do this is with our strong volunteer program,&rdquo; Ginenthal said.</p>
<p>Sunday Parkways routes are designed to introduce people to comfortable routes for people new to biking. So they focus on neighborhood greenways rather than wider, busy streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take your 8-year-old on Burnside or Sandy but you might take him on Northeast Going Street, or Southeast Ankeny or Bush Street in East Portland,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They are like Sunday Parkways every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the Portland Fire &amp; Rescue Technical Rescue Team will lead the exercise. They will be assisted by representatives from both the City of Portland, whose Bureau of Transportation owns the tram, &nbsp;and Oregon Health &amp; Science University, which operates the tram in conjunction with Doppelmayr USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using ropes and harnesses, the team will lower seven volunteers playing the role of passengers 100 feet to the top floor of the OHSU Casey Eye Institute&rsquo;s parking garage<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The training allows crews to practice an aerial rescue in the event the tram is stopped for an extended period of time with passengers on board. <strong>If members of the public contact you with questions about the training, please inform them that this is a scheduled training exercise and not a real emergency.</strong></p>
<p>The exercise has been conducted annually since the Portland Aerial Tram opened on Jan. 27, 2007 and is designed to provide personnel with experience in executing a last resort safety measure.&nbsp; There has never been a real emergency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 7,000 daily commuters and tourists ride the Portland Aerial Tram; the tram is one of only two used for urban transit in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN: &nbsp;</strong>9 a.m. Sunday, Oct.4, 2015 - The exercise should be completed by noon.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE: &nbsp;</strong>The training will take place above the OHSU Casey Eye Institute parking garage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SPECTATORS: &nbsp;</strong>The Portland Aerial Tram is closed on Sundays during the fall and winter. As a result, the training exercise will not interfere with regular operations. For those interested in observing, please do so from nearby locations and refrain from entering the Casey Eye Institute parking lot.&nbsp;<em></em></p>

Participants also celebrated ten years of PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School program successfully making walking and biking to school safer and easier for Portland students and families.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, the Portland Safe Routes program has made impressive gains in increasing the number of students walking and biking to school. Starting with eight elementary partner schools in its first year, the program now serves over 100 elementary, K-8 and middle schools across 5 school districts and reaches over 40,000 students. The program will pilot its first high school programs this year.</p>
<p>Today 43.6 percent of trips to school in Portland are on foot or by bike, an increase of 35 percent from when the program began ten years ago. Thanks to the Safe Routes program, 33 percent of students walk to school, 9 percent bike and 1.6 percent roll. Nationally, the numbers are much lower with 12 percent of students walking and 1 percent biking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to our community partnerships, we have a created a nationally recognized Safe Routes to School Program that has inspired thousands of Portland students and families to regularly bike, walk and roll to school,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;Though we&rsquo;re exceeding national Safe Routes participation rates, we know that biking and walking to school is not a viable option in neighborhoods without sidewalks, bikeways and improved crossings. I&rsquo;ll continue to work hard to secure the resources to make needed infrastructure improvements so that families can safely walk and bike throughout all Portland neighborhoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=547785"" alt=""biking to school"" width=""350"" height=""233.333333333"" />&ldquo;PPS loves Portland&rsquo;s Safe Routes to Schools Program because it guarantees that every student that wants to walk or ride their bike to school can get there safely,&rdquo; said Portland School Board Member Mike Rosen, &ldquo;That makes for healthier kids and a healthier planet. &nbsp;We very much appreciate the Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s wise and generous investment in our kids. Lent K-8 is a school that takes the health of our students and the planet very seriously. &nbsp;Whether they and their community volunteers are growing food for the school and community to eat in their on campus garden or they are providing free weekly bike repairs to all students, this community gets the connection between a healthy school and a healthy neighborhood.&rdquo;<br /> <br /> &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to celebrate the incredible successes of Safe Routes to School, but there is still much more we are working to accomplish,&rdquo; said Transportation Bureau Director Leah Treat, &ldquo;In the next ten years, we want to increase the number of Portland area students getting to school by foot, bike or bus to 75 percent. We want to engage our city&rsquo;s high school students as leaders on school transportation issues affecting youth. And we want all students across Portland have the opportunity to learn to navigate safely around their neighborhoods by bike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lent K-8 School has been a long-standing partner of the Portland Safe Routes to School program, joining the effort in 2007. The Safe Routes program teaches Lent 2<sup>nd</sup> graders pedestrian safety skills every winter and provides 10 hours of hands-on bike safety instruction to 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> graders each spring. The school has been the recipient of federal grant funds administered by ODOT, which have improved pedestrian crossings to the school. Lent is a Title 1 school and has a diverse student body, with the majority of students representing communities of color.</p>
<p>In addition to Lent K-8 School, 70 Portland area schools representing 33,000 students will be holding events today in celebration of International Walk and Bike to School Day. International Walk and Bike to School Day is a global event that involves communities from more than 40 countries walking and biking to school on the same day. Started in 1997, the event has become part of a movement for year-round safe routes to school and a celebration &ndash; with record breaking participation &ndash; each October.</p>

This action will take place on <strong>Thursday, October 15, 11AM &ndash; 12:30PM </strong>at the marked crossing on<strong> SE Belmont and SE 46<sup>th</sup> Ave </strong>in front of the SE Multicultural Service Center. Commissioner Steve Novick will be the designated pedestrian for a portion of the enforcement action.</p>
<p>White Cane Safety Day has been observed nationally each October since 1964. The day is set aside to celebrate the achievements of people who are blind or visually impaired as well as the important symbol of blindness and tool of independence, the white cane.</p>
<p><em>What are crosswalk education and enforcement actions?</em> PBOT conducts crosswalk education and enforcement actions approximately once each month. These actions include one or more designated pedestrians positioned at locations with marked or unmarked crosswalks and significant pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Drivers failing to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians that jaywalk can receive warnings or citations. The purpose of each crosswalk education and enforcement action is to educate community members about Oregon crosswalk laws and to enforce the law.</p>
<p>Oregon crosswalk law (<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/811.028"">ORS 811.028</a>) states that &ldquo;Motorists are required to stop and stay stopped for pedestrians in a marked or unmarked crosswalk when the pedestrian is in the motorist&rsquo;s lane or the adjacent lane.&rdquo; In addition, motorists are required to stop <strong>curb to curb</strong> for a person who is blind or blind and deaf, who is carrying a white cane or accompanied by a dog guide, and is crossing or about to cross a roadway (<a href=""http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/811.035"">ORS 811.035</a>). &nbsp;Read the Oregon Department of Transportation brochure&nbsp;<em>What You Need to Know About Oregon Crosswalk Laws</em>&nbsp;by <a href=""/transportation/article/126818"">clicking here</a>.</p>

<p>City Commissioner Steve Novick will be the designated walker for part of the event and Sharon White of PBOT will be the designated walker for the remainder of the mission. Two people who have low or no vision will plan to attend and speak with members of the media about the traffic safety challenges they face each day.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=548434"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Education and enforcement actions such as the Oct. 15 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>White Cane Safety Day, celebrated each October 15th, recognizes the achievements of people who are blind and visually impaired in the United States and reminds everyone about how the white cane is an important tool in helping people who are blind and visually impaired live with greater independence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City of Portland&rsquo;s crosswalk enforcement efforts supplement our engineering, education, and outreach efforts to foster a more walkable city,&rdquo; said Novick, who oversees PBOT.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of the collaboration between City bureaus that makes these crosswalk actions possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a pedestrian decoy positioned at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, biking and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who jaywalk may be issued a warning or citation by the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Oregon crosswalk law (ORS 811.035) states, &ldquo;A driver approaching a pedestrian who is blind or blind and deaf, who is carrying a white cane or accompanied by a dog guide, and who is crossing or about to cross a roadway, shall stop and remain stopped until the pedestrian has crossed the roadway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recognition of White Cane Safety Day, the City of Portland Bureau of Transportation remind all drivers to be aware pedestrians in the crossing and knowledgeable of the specific laws related to pedestrians who are blind.&nbsp; Commissioner Novick says &ldquo;Drivers should continually scan their environment looking for pedestrians in the crossing and about to cross.&nbsp; Leave adequate space between you and the vehicle in front of you to increase your cone of vision and be prepared to stop and stay stopped for any pedestrian including people using a white cane or guide dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Cooke, Rehabilitation Instructor for Oregon Commission for the Blind, reminds all drivers to &ldquo;Watch for those with vision loss sharing the roadway every day.&nbsp; People with white canes and dog guides have the right-or-way from curb to curb when they cross the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=548435"" alt=""Image of crosswalk on SE Belmont at 46th"" width=""436"" height=""239"" />This SE Belmont Street and SE 46<sup>th</sup> Avenue location was selected because of the proximity to the SE Multicultural Service Center that provides social connections and service opportunities to a diverse group of community members including people with low or no vision.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

News,548656,News Release: Community celebrates new traffic signal at North Vancouver and Cook,1,,2015-11-24 22:38:04 UTC,2015-10-14 19:45:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img title=""Director Leah Treat cuts the ceremonial ribbon at the new traffic signal at North Vancouver and Cook."" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=554888"" alt=""Director Leah Treat cuts the ceremonial ribbon at the new traffic signal at North Vancouver and Cook."" width=""670"" height=""446.666666667"" /><br /><br />(October 14, 2015) Local business owners and community members from the Boise and Eliot neighborhoods gathered today at the intersection of North Vancouver and Cook to activate a new traffic signal installed by the Portland Bureau of Transportation. The signal will improve safety for people riding bicycles on Portland&rsquo;s busiest bike route and people walking will now have crosswalks and pedestrian signals - making it easier and safer for them to navigate their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new signal at North Vancouver and Cook fills a long-standing traffic need sought by the community. The Fremont Bridge opened in November 1973, but traffic signals were not installed on the nearby streets, creating traffic flow problems and safety concerns at nearby intersections. The unsignalized intersection at North Vancouver and Cook has been on the City&rsquo;s top 10 list for right angle crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=548655"" alt=""Ben Kaiser"" width=""350"" height=""233.45"" />The event highlighted the positive impact of the North Vancouver Avenue and Cook Street Local Improvement District. A Local Improvement District (LID) is a partnership between PBOT and a group of local property owners. The property owners pool their resources to share the cost of transportation infrastructure improvements. PBOT manages the design and construction of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Credit goes to the members of the Boise and Eliot neighborhoods and the local business community &ndash; many of whom have been advocating for this traffic signal for a very long time,&rdquo; said Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat, &ldquo;It is because of their community spirit and persistence that we have this signal here today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The North Vancouver and Cook Street LID was approved by City Council in May 2014 and included six participating property owners. It was the first LID in the city to focus primarily on traffic signals and utility undergrounding. It raised $1,055,000 for the following improvements:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=548654"" alt=""Joy Mack"" width=""350"" height=""231.7"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Realignment of eastbound lanes -- North Cook Street from the Interstate 405 off-ramp to North Vancouver Avenue</li>
<li>New mast arm traffic signal -- North Vancouver Avenue &amp; Cook Street intersection</li>
<li>New mast arm traffic signal to replace existing span wire signal -- North Vancouver Avenue &amp; Fremont Street intersection</li>
<li>New mast arm traffic signal to replace existing span wire signal --North Williams Avenue &amp; Fremont Street intersection</li>
<li>New left turn signal from N. Fremont St. westbound to N. Vancouver Avenue southbound</li>
</ul>
<p>The investment will support improved traffic flow and safety for travelers. Participating property owners of the North Vancouver and Cook LID include: The American Red Cross, Legacy Health, Kaiser Group, Karuna Properties, Cook Street Apartments LLC and New Seasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIDs have proven an effective tool for achieving economies of scale and allowing a community to implement comprehensive and complete infrastructure solutions for their neighborhoods.

Installing the improvements will require lane closures on Third Avenue on Saturday, Oct. 17, from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday, Oct. 18, from 5 a.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp;Parking for motor vehicles on the west side of the street will also be limited during the installation.</p>
<p>This community-led project will result in safer pedestrian crossings, a bicycle lane, reduced travel speeds for motor vehicles, and increased pedestrian space. As a part of the plan, PBOT recently installed 14 new marked crosswalks in the area. The new two-lane roadway configuration will further increase pedestrian safety by creating a shorter distance for pedestrians to cross with moving motor vehicle traffic. The project will also improve the bicycle network by connecting the existing bicycle lane on Third Avenue that terminates at NW Davis with the existing bicycle lanes on Stark and Oak Streets. The new lane will be a wide, buffered bicycle lane to increase comfort for all ages and abilities of bicycle riders, such as tourists and families. The bicycle lane design will also reduce conflict between bicycle and motor vehicle traffic.</p>
<p>The traveling public is advised to expect delays while improvements are being made. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.</p>
<p>This work is weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>

News,549240,News Release: Summary Report of the Private for Hire Transportation Innovation Pilot Program Released,1,,2015-10-19 18:08:16 UTC,2015-10-19 18:07:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(October 19, 2015) &ndash; Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation released the summary report analyzing data gathered during the first four months of Portland&rsquo;s Private for-Hire Transportation (PFHT) Innovation Pilot Program. Based on a sample size of over a million rides given by both taxis and transportation network companies (TNCs) between May 1<sup>st</sup> and August 31<sup>st</sup>, the report presents a detailed picture of Portland&rsquo;s rapidly evolving PFHT market. Data analyzed include trip dates and times, origin and destination information, customer wait times, trip durations, and wheelchair accessible service availability.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s key finding include:</p>
<ul>
<li>During the four month study period, taxis and TNCs provided over 1 million rides to customers, a level of ridership that indicates growing consumer demand for PFHT service in Portland.</li>
<li>Between May and August, TNCs saw their ridership increase 125% while taxi ridership dropped by 16%. Overall ridership in the Portland market increased by 40% during the period under study.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Neighborhoods in East Portland that have historically received less for-hire transportation service experienced a marked improvement throughout the Pilot Program. During the four month study period, both TNCs and taxis provided increased service to East Portland and the area saw a nearly 50% increase in overall private for-hire service levels.</li>
<li>Both TNCs and taxis are required to accommodate requests for service from people with disabilities, including customers who require wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAV). The study found that TNCs provided 400 WAV rides in the four month period, while taxis provided 2,600.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Good data is critical to create a private for-hire market that is fair and competitive and that provides all Portlanders with safe and convenient service,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;This study provides key insights that policy makers, community stakeholders and the taxi and TNC companies will need as they move forward with new regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City&rsquo;s PFHT Innovation Pilot Program launched on April 24, 2015. The program created new regulations for taxis and allowed TNCs to operate legally in Portland. Both taxi companies and TNCs were required to report aggregated, anonymized ridership data for analysis by the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>

News,549735,Portland counts bikes!,1,,2015-10-22 02:22:27 UTC,2015-10-22 02:04:00 UTC,A,The humble clipboard and the mighty volunteer capture the data we need,"<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=549734"" alt=""Volunteer counting people on bikes"" width=""250"" height=""187.5"" />(October 21, 2015) Every summer, volunteers across Portland stand on street corners and at trailheads, clipboards in hand, to take a census of the city&rsquo;s bike and pedestrian travelers. This year, PBOT recruited more than 150 volunteers to conduct these counts at 281 different sites across town. Spanning four months, volunteers tallied close to 240,000 people walking and biking.</p>
<p><strong><em>Annual Portland Bike Count</em></strong></p>
<p>Most of these counts were completed as part of Portland&rsquo;s annual bicycle count, occurring every summer June through September for more than ten years. The counts are used to estimate how many bikes are riding on a daily basis. Each of these 235 two-hour counts track turning movements at an intersection, usually where two bikeways meet (such as a street with a bike lane and a neighborhood greenway). The most bikes at a single intersection were counted at N Vancouver &amp; Russell (a 7-9am count) with an amazing 1,028 bikes tallied.</p>
<p>In addition, these bike counts also track the gender of riders and whether or not they are wearing a helmet. Preliminary results suggest that at least 32% of riders are women and 82% of all riders wear helmets. These stats are very similar to last year&rsquo;s count in which 32% of riders were women and 81% of all riders were wearing helmets.</p>
<p>A question we get asked a lot is, why count gender? Portland Bicycle Coordinator Roger Geller answers this question in the most recent bike count report for 2013 &amp; 2014 counts. Regarding gender, Geller says,</p>
<p><em>Cities with high bicycle use typically achieve a balance between male and female ridership. Gender parity in bicycling is considered an important indicator of success in creating safe, comfortable and attractive conditions for bicycling.</em></p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s gender split is pretty good compared to other major US cities, but still not quite 50/50.</p>
<p><strong><em>International Gender Study</em></strong></p>
<p>This summer Portland was asked to participate in an international bike count to establish gender split at a global level through the Bicycle Network in Australia. Several intrepid volunteers stuck it out on frosty mornings in October to collect rush hour results at fourteen different sites. Female rider mode share ranged from a high of 42% at NE Tillamook &amp; 7<sup>th</sup> down to just 20% at SW Columbia &amp; 14<sup>th</sup>. Complete results aren&rsquo;t in yet, but PBOT is excited to continue to grow and set an example on the international stage. For more info on the global bike count, see here: <a href=""https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/general/for-government-and-business/3533/"">https://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/general/for-government-and-business/3533/</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bike &amp; Pedestrian Trail Count</em></strong></p>
<p>The remaining 46 counts this summer were completed as part of the National Bicycle and Pedestrian Documentation Project, which collects counts for one week in September every year. PBOT and Metro team up each year to count pedestrians and bicyclists utilizing Portland&rsquo;s trail system. Sites are located on the Springwater Corridor, Willamette Greenway, I-205 Trail, several of the Willamette River bridges, and more.</p>
<p>Many sites are counted on a mid-week day during evening rush hour as well as a weekend morning. The highest weekday count occurred on the Hawthorne Bridge with a whopping 1,233. The amazing part is that this includes the south side of the bridge only, where most bikes are headed eastbound (combined total for both sides was 1,663!). The highest weekend count was found on the Eastbank Esplanade near OMSI and the new Tilikum Crossing where 1,181 trail users passed by. The trail count also tracks gender of trail users. Of all users, just under 40% were female; 31% of people on bikes and 50% of people walking were female.</p>
<p>Overall, PBOT saw an amazing volunteer turn-out for these two count projects. Portland has one of the most robust bike and pedestrian databases across the country, and it would not be possible without all 562 hours of volunteer work to complete counts this year. Most volunteers come back for more counts after their first year, and many conduct multiple counts in one season. PBOT always needs more volunteers to count!</p>

With the fewer hours of light each day during winter, make sure that lights and reflective gear are part of your daily fashion statement.</p>
<p>When on foot, consider light-colored clothing or <a href=""http://trimet.org/beseen/"">reflective outerwear</a> - you&rsquo;re first visible to a driver 500 feet away (about 2 downtown blocks) with reflective clothing, versus just 55 feet when wearing dark colors with no reflectivity. You can also add clip-on lights to your bag, jacket or even a leash if you are walking a pet.</p>
<p>If you are waiting for the bus at a dimly lit stop, you can use your smartphone to get the driver&rsquo;s attention. Just wave your lit phone as the bus approaches or use <a href=""http://trimet.org/apps/index.htm"">an app</a> to transform your phone into a beacon of light.</p>
<p>When biking, be sure you use lights and reflectors to illuminate your way. Oregon law requires a front white light that is visible from 500 feet and a red, rear reflector or light that is visible from 600 feet. &nbsp;Reflective ankle straps or shoe highlights draw extra attention due to your pedaling motion.</p>

News,554100,"News Release: SE Clinton Neighborhood Greenway to be enhanced with diverter installation, following public awareness campaign",1,,2015-11-19 22:58:21 UTC,2015-11-19 22:11:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(November 19, 2015) As a part of the <a href=""/transportation/68514"">Clinton Neighborhood Greenway Enhancement Project</a>, the Portland Bureau of Transportation has scheduled the installation of two traffic diverters on SE Clinton Street at SE 17<sup>th</sup> Avenue and 32<sup>nd</sup> Avenue. Weather permitting, the diverters will be installed during the first week of January 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in early December, PBOT will conduct an education and awareness campaign to alert people who use SE Clinton to the street&rsquo;s status as a neighborhood greenway. The campaign is a direct response to the feedback PBOT received during the public involvement process. This process included two open houses with approximately 300 total participants. PBOT also received over 700 comments submitted to the bureau either at the open houses or on-line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Clinton Neighborhood Greenway Enhancement Project focuses on reducing auto traffic volumes and speeds to comply with the performance guidelines recently established for neighborhood greenways in the Neighborhood Greenway Assessment Report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This report was unanimously accepted by City Council this past summer. Using newly adopted performance guidelines, the report evaluates Portland&rsquo;s existing Neighborhood Greenway network. This evaluation determined that while neighborhood greenways are very popular element of Portland&rsquo;s bicycle system, some of the older routes are no longer providing conditions that allow for safe and comfortable bicycle use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the case on SE Clinton. Between SE 12<sup>th</sup> Avenue and SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard, traffic volumes currently exceed the upper acceptable limit of 2,000 cars/day by 200 to 1,000 cars.&nbsp; Much of this traffic is believed to be non-local cut-through traffic that should be using either SE Division Street or SE Powell Boulevard. Public comment leading up to the adoption of the assessment report strongly supported SE Clinton as a candidate for improvement to address the speed and volume issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rdquo;We build Neighborhood Greenways to make it safe and inviting for more Portlanders to walk and bike,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;As Portland continues to grow and our traffic patterns evolve, we need to support and enhance our Greenway network. That&rsquo;s our goal on SE Clinton and throughout the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The diverters will be installed as part of a six month trial period to assess their effect on improving conditions for people who walk and bike on SE Clinton and decreasing the traffic on the street. A citizen&rsquo;s advisory committee will assist in the evaluation of the trial period and also recommend if modifications are needed for the project&rsquo;s second phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the diverters, PBOT will be changing 34<sup>th</sup> Avenue to a one-way northbound street, with a contraflow southbound bike lane.&nbsp; If traffic volumes can be reduced below 2,000 cars per day, the street section will also be signed for 20 mph. East of SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard, PBOT will install speed bumps. Construction of the changes to 34<sup>th</sup> Ave will begin as soon as the weather permits striping work.&nbsp; Installation of the speed bumps east of SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard will begin next spring when weather conditions allow that type of construction.</p>

Distracted walking occurs when you engage in any activity that diverts your attention from what is happening around you and escalates your risk for injury or death.</p>
<p>Distracted walking, just like distracted driving, is a choice. Talking, texting, surfing, or gaming on your cell phone are all examples of distracted walking. Are you a Pedtextrian? A Pedtextrian is &ldquo;one who texts while walking, usually unaware of their surroundings&rdquo;, according to the Urban Dictionary.</p>
<p>Listening to music or podcasts on your ear buds or headphones at a level loud enough to prevent you from hearing what is happening around you is also distracted walking. Before crossing the street, or while walking in trafficked areas (whether with other pedestrians, bikes or vehicles), put down your cell phone, take our your ear buds, and look both ways before crossing to make sure oncoming drivers see you, have time to stop and have stopped before you cross.</p>
<p>Most crashes are preventable. We are all human and we all make mistakes. Tragically, sometimes our mistakes end up costing us or someone else their life. If we all do our part to act responsibly as walkers, bicyclists, transit riders, and drivers, then we can all get to where we want to go safely.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/553865

<p>Working with other agencies, PBOT has been preparing for winter snow and ice conditions. PBOT officials introduced updated snow plow and de-icing routes. The bureau announced that it has expanded its de-icing routes by 40 miles, including 20 additional miles of coverage of Portland Public School bus routes. The bureau also announced it has switched to magnesium chloride as its de-icing agent to clear ice more effectively and efficiently. Magnesium chloride is also used by ODOT, and by using the same chemical, PBOT will be able to purchase more product at a lower cost and share supplies with the state during a storm.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=554847"" alt=""Maurice Henderson"" width=""250"" height=""166.666666667"" />&ldquo;Thanksgiving is the start of the winter travel season, but PBOT has already been preparing for winter weather for months,&rdquo; said Maurice Henderson, Deputy Director of PBOT. &ldquo;Helping Portlanders get home safe is our winter weather mission. We&rsquo;re ready and we need the public to be ready too. That is why we&rsquo;re joining our state and regional partners to spread the word about what people who drive, walk and bike can do to be safe during a winter storm. Bad weather is inevitable. Unsafe travel doesn&rsquo;t have to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suzanne Kahn, PBOT&rsquo;s Maintenance Operations Group Manager, highlighted the steps PBOT has taken and will take to prepare for winter weather. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve inspected our equipment, and our crews have trained and reviewed their snow and de-icing routes. When a major storm hits, our crews will work around the clock. PBOT has been preparing for months for winter weather. Now we need Portlanders to partner with us and use our winter weather tips so they can get home safe in the event of a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Transportation begins annual preparations for winter weather by conducting a training/refresher course for Maintenance Operations crews on snow plow operations during the last week of October. Crews practice maneuvering dump trucks fitted with snowplows and sand spreaders on a large obstacle course at Sunderland Yard.</p>
<p>Following completion of the course, crew members conduct a full check of the snow vehicle fleet at PBOT&rsquo;s incident response headquarters at the Kerby Maintenance Offices. They also drive trucks along their assigned snow routes to re-familiarize themselves with the routes and terrain.</p>
<p>When there is a snow, sleet, ice, or other winter weather event, PBOT&rsquo;s top priority is safety. Transportation crews will work to help Portlanders travel safety and to minimize inconvenience to residents and businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate our partnership with PBOT and ODOT as they keep roads passable, which helps us keep transit running and safely connecting riders to their destinations,&rdquo; said TriMet spokesperson Mary Fetsch. &ldquo;We do travel slower in wintery conditions, so we want to remind our riders to be prepared for delays and the elements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officials with the Oregon Department of Transportation and Washington State Department of Transportation also spoke at the event. Partners attending included the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management, Portland Aerial Tram and Portland Streetcar Inc.</p>

<p>(Nov. 24, 2015) Traffic engineers from the Portland Bureau of Transportation have activated Portland&rsquo;s first <a href=""/transportation/article/554938"">&ldquo;pedestrian scramble&rdquo;</a> at the corner of NW 11th Avenue and Couch Street in the Pearl District, just ahead of the holiday shopping season. The pedestrian scramble crossing is one of three new traffic signals in the Pearl District. The newly-activated traffic signals are located at the intersections of NW 11th Avenue and Couch Street, NW 10th Avenue and Couch Street and NW Broadway and Couch Street.</p>
<p>A pedestrian scramble, also called a &ldquo;Barnes Dance&rdquo; after 20th century traffic engineer Henry Barnes, is an intersection where motor vehicle traffic halts and pedestrians are given priority. During the scramble, people may cross the intersection in all directions &ndash; including diagonally. The intersection of NW 11th and Couch is one of the most heavily used pedestrian crossings in Portland, in addition to being along the A Loop, B Loop and North/South Streetcar lines, making it highly suitable for a scramble crossing.</p>
<p>The pedestrian scramble intersection at 11th and Couch consists of <a href=""/transportation/article/554938"">three phases</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first phase is the scramble, which allows for people walking to cross in all directions &ndash; including diagonally across the intersection.</li>
<li>The second phase is an east side only crossing, allowing for pedestrians to cross NW Couch between Powell&rsquo;s Books and Starbucks while the Streetcar and other motor vehicles move north-south through the intersection.</li>
<li>The third phase is a north side only crossing, which allows for pedestrians to cross NW 11th Avenue while motor vehicles travel east-west on NW Couch or turn south on NW 11th towards West Burnside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=554930"" alt=""Crew installs pedestrian scramble intersection"" width=""635"" height=""423"" /></p>
<p>A &ldquo;Portland-style&rdquo; event to celebrate the opening of the City&rsquo;s first scramble crossing is scheduled for Dec. 5. Details are forthcoming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In total, five new signals will be installed in the Pearl and in Old Town Chinatown. The $2.4 million in signals is being paid for with urban renewal funds from the Portland Development Commission and PBOT System Development Charges, which come from real estate development.</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation asks the traveling public to be mindful of others and obey all traffic signs and signals and to use caution when crossing streetcar tracks.</p>

<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=555600"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />PBOT crews will install a crash attenuator and jersey barriers to reduce crashes at this location, where there were two fatal crashes earlier this year. The attenuator and barriers will be installed between westbound lanes and the northbound exit ramp. Engineering solutions that reduce crashes are part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero effort to eliminate fatal and serious injury traffic crashes. Learn more about PBOT&rsquo;s safety work and the citywide Vision Zero effort at <a href=""/transportation/www.visionzeroportland.com"">VisionZeroPortland.com</a>.</p>
<p>During installation, one lane westbound will be closed, and a detour for the ramp to northbound 33<sup>rd</sup> Drive will be in effect during work hours, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends and from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays. The public is advised to expect delays, travel cautiously, observe lane closures, use detours and alternate routes if possible.</p>
<p>Advisory message boards are currently in place in the area and will remain during the duration of the project.</p>
<p>The detour route will show travelers how to go from westbound Columbia Blvd to northbound 33<sup>rd</sup> Drive. The exit ramp from Columbia Blvd westbound to 33<sup>rd</sup> Drive northbound will be detoured north on NE 21<sup>st</sup> Avenue, east on NE Riverside Way, to NE 33<sup>rd</sup> Drive northbound.</p>

<h3 class=""content-center""><em><strong>Mt. Scott Community Center opens as reception center for Johnson Creek area residents</strong></em></h3>
<p>(Dec. 8, 2015) Heavy rain, combined with winds gusting to between 30-45 MPH, are expected this afternoon through Wednesday morning. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) asks the traveling public, residents and businesses to take steps to avoid hazards associated with these conditions. Potential hazards include flooded streets and properties, downed trees, tree limbs, and power lines, and landslides and rock slides.</p>
<p>Storm-related closures will cause delays for all transportation modes during rush hour on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. Avoid unnecessary travel during those times. Expect delays. Consider telecommuting or delaying your trip.</p>
<p>Strong winds may bring fallen trees, tree limbs, and power lines onto streets. Residents are advised to notify PBOT of debris, mud, rocks, trees, or branches blocking a road by calling our 24/7 maintenance dispatch hotline at 503-823-1700. If you see a downed power line, call 911. Report power outages in the Portland area to PGE at 503-464-7777 or Pacific Power at 1-877-508-5088. Do not try to free lines or to remove tree limbs from lines by yourself.</p>
<p>If a storm knocks out power to traffic signals, treat intersections like an all-way stop and proceed with caution. The driver who stops first has the right of way to go first.</p>
<p>City crews have stocked sand pile and sand bag locations for any Portland resident or business owner who wants to protect their property from flood damage in the Fanno Creek and Johnson Creek watersheds.&nbsp;Sand and sand bags are provided at no charge; you must bring your own shovel.</p>
<p>The following locations are stocked:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;SE 88th Ave just south of Holgate Blvd in the parking lot at Lents Park,</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;SE 111th Ave and Harold St at the southeast corner of the intersection, and</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;SW 42nd Ave and Vermont St in the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park.</p>
<p>A number of road closures are still in effect throughout the city. Please consult PBOT&rsquo;s website for the latest weather-related road closures in Portland. City crews are prepared to close additional flooded streets and set up detour routes if necessary. Do not to drive through standing water; instead, turn around safely and find an alternate route. Slow down when streets are wet, use your lights for increased visibility, stay away from puddles and be on the lookout for people walking and biking making their way around standing water, especially in low-light conditions. People driving who ignore street closures and drive through barricades face fines of up to $1000.</p>
<p>For residents living in the Johnson Creek area who decided to evacuate to higher ground, the Mt. Scott Community Center (5530 SE 72nd Ave, Portland OR 97206) will open at 3 p.m. as a reception center to provide shelter to residents and their pets. The American Red Cross and Multnomah County Animal Services will be on hand as a resource.

You can also provide your comments through February 18 by email to <a href=""mailto:ORBikePEDPlan@odot.state.or.us"">ORBikePEDPlan@odot.state.or.us</a>.</p>
<p>The Oregon Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan is important because it supports the decision-making for walking and biking investments, strategies and programs that will help create the future transportation system for Oregon. The last plan was adopted by the Oregon Transportation Commission in 1995.</p>
<p>The updated plan addresses the challenges and opportunities Oregon faces today and will likely face in the future, is based on realistic current and future funding levels and incorporates current laws. While not intended to create a map of the bicycle and pedestrian network or develop new design guidance, it is meant to guide the state through future efforts such as prioritizing projects, developing design guidance, collecting important data, and other activities that support walking and biking in Oregon.</p>

News,555092,Up your visibility game,1,,2015-12-15 19:28:38 UTC,2015-12-10 15:29:00 UTC,A,"With fewer daylight hours and rainy weather, be seen to be safe","<p>(December 10, 2015) What is the best strategy for being seen and staying safe while out and about during a Portland winter? Invest some time or money in high visibility gear or clothing.</p>
<p>High visibility gear and clothing is made of fluorescent colors with added reflective tape or designs. To best be seen in all conditions - during the day, at dusk and at night - you should be wearing both fluorescent and reflective items.</p>
<p><strong>Daytime Visibility</strong></p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=555091"" alt=""Man wearing bright colors and reflective gear"" width=""240"" height=""160"" />Wear something fluorescent to be most visible during the daytime. Fluorescent materials appear bright during the day and even brighter near dusk, but are less effective for nighttime use.</p>
<p>It has to do with optics theory and physics, but fluorescent colors look really bright because of the way they absorb and emit different kinds of light. Lots of colors can be fluorescent but the yellow and orange clothing worn by road crews and emergency personnel as well as some green and pink colors are the most popular and effective.</p>
<p>During the daylight hours the sun&rsquo;s ultraviolet rays react with the fluorescent colors to make them appear to glow, or fluoresce, and this effect is even stronger in poor light conditions such as in rain, fog or toward dusk, which are typical Portland winter conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Nighttime Visibility</strong></p>
<p>Wear something reflective to be the most visible at nighttime. After dark, the light from sources like car headlights bounces off reflective materials, actually making them glow, and reflects at least some of that light back to the source.</p>
<p>Since reflective materials work at night by bouncing back the light from a source, to work properly it needs to be dark and there must be a light source such as car headlights. These materials are not so effective during the daytime.</p>
<p>Not all reflective materials are created the same, however. Some technology scatters the reflective light with only some of the light being directed back to drivers. Retro-reflective materials are designed to bounce most of the light back to its source rather than scattering it. The light from a driver&rsquo;s headlights will go straight back to the driver allowing them to see the retro-reflective material, and thus the pedestrian or bicyclist wearing it, extremely well.</p>
<p><strong>Up Your Visibility Game</strong></p>
<p>What can you do if you don&rsquo;t want to buy all new outerwear? If your rain gear is dark colored or even black, it&rsquo;s a good idea to wear or carry something fluorescent on rainy days. Think a bright orange or yellow umbrella or even a safety sash or vest.</p>
<p>You can also add reflective tape to your regular clothing to be more visible at night. Reflective tapes and sew-on materials can be purchased online, at some craft or fabric stores, hardware stores, safety supply stores such as Sanderson&rsquo;s Safety Supply, and even auto supply stores and bike shops.</p>
<p>The best place to add strips of reflective materials are around the joints or moving parts of the human form. Adding reflective bits of material to the ankles, knees, elbows and wrists will help the driver recognize you as a person on the move and send the message that they need to slow down. The main thing to remember is:&nbsp;<em>Fluorescent for day, Reflective for night.</em></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/555092

News,557028,News Release: Traffic enforcement and education action on SE Clinton Street  to highlight safety on neighborhood greenways,1,,2015-12-15 00:05:59 UTC,2015-12-15 00:02:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(December 14, 2015) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau advise the traveling public that a traffic education and enforcement action is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15 on SE Clinton Street between SE 12<sup>th</sup> Avenue and SE 50<sup>th</sup> Avenue from 9:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The action is part of the project to enhance the Clinton Greenway and make it more inviting for people who are walking and biking. During the public meetings to discuss the project, community members asked PBOT to initiate an education and enforcement campaign to make drivers aware of the unique role that neighborhood greenways play in encouraging walking and biking. The Portland City Council has also made a commitment to protect and enhance the city&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the enforcement action, the Portland Police Bureau will be on the lookout for violations that threaten the safety of people walking and biking. These violations include unsafe passing, speeding, aggressive driving, and noncompliance with stop signs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways are where people of all ages and abilities have the opportunity to bicycle, walk and play. As such, neighborhood greenways need to maintain low auto volumes and speeds, provide protected crossings at major intersections, and create an environment that encourages people of all ages to travel actively. Between SE 12th Avenue and SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard, traffic volumes currently exceed the upper acceptable limit of 2,000 cars/day by 200 to 1,000 cars. Much of this traffic is believed to be non-local cut-through traffic that should be using either SE Division Street or SE Powell Boulevard. More information about the greenways can be found at: <a href=""/transportation/50518"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/50518</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways represent some of the best elements of Portland&rsquo;s transportation culture,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We need to ensure that our city&rsquo;s greenways remain safe streets where people want to bike, walk and play. We appreciate the support of the Portland Police Bureau in these efforts and for their support of Vision Zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the overall improvement of the Clinton Neighborhood Greenway, PBOT has also scheduled the installation of two traffic diverters on SE Clinton Street at SE 17th Avenue and 32nd Avenue. Weather permitting, the diverters will be installed during the first week of January 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traffic education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions about once each month in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

This service is only available outside of Downtown and the Lloyd District and for drop-offs only.</p>
<p>Between 8:00 pm and 5:00 am, you can ask your bus operator a block or two ahead of your destination whether she or he can let you off at a non-designated stop location. If the operator believes it can be done safely, they will stop at your requested location.</p>
<p>Whether its morning or night, winter makes it difficult to be seen. When waiting at the bus stop, TriMet offers these additional tips:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Stand up at the bus stop and wave to the operator as the bus approaches.</li>
<li>Use a reflector, safety strobe light, small flashlight or cell phone display light to alert the operator as the bus approaches. Some mobile devices and apps have a strobe or light feature for this purpose.</li>
<li>Please,&nbsp;<strong>DO NOT</strong>&nbsp;shine lights in operators&rsquo; eyes.</li>

News,557208,News Release: PBOT and Portland Police release results of Clinton Street education and enforcement action,1,,2015-12-16 21:51:48 UTC,2015-12-16 21:49:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(December 16, 2015) The Portland Bureau of Transportation and the Portland Police Bureau have released the results of Tuesday's traffic enforcement and education action on SE Clinton Street between SE 12th Avenue and SE 50th Avenue. The action generated 35 citations and 25 warnings, with a total of 45 people driving cars and 15 people riding bicycles stopped over the course of the day. With each traffic stop, officers from PPB also distributed Vision Zero pamphlets with information about safe travel for people who walk, bike and/or drive.</p>
<p>During the enforcement action, the Portland Police Bureau was on the lookout for violations that threatened the safety of people walking and biking. These violations included unsafe passing, speeding, aggressive driving, and noncompliance with stop signs.</p>
<p>The enforcement action was a component of the education and outreach program for the <a href=""/transportation/68514"">Clinton Neighborhood Greenway Enhancement Project</a>. The project addresses auto volume and speed issues on Clinton in order to make the greenway more inviting for people who walk and bike. During the public meetings to discuss the project, community members asked PBOT to initiate an education and enforcement campaign to make drivers aware of the unique role that neighborhood greenways play in encouraging walking and biking. The Portland City Council has also made a commitment to protect and enhance the city's neighborhood greenways.</p>
<p>As part of the overall improvement of the Clinton Neighborhood Greenway, PBOT has also scheduled the installation of two traffic diverters on SE Clinton Street at SE 17th Avenue and 32nd Avenue. Weather permitting, the diverters will be installed during the first week of January 2016.</p>
<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the December 15 event are a key part of the City of Portland's citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.

News,557231,"Severe Weather Advisory: PBOT warns public to expect heavy rainfall during Thursday morning commute, use caution",1,,2015-12-22 23:56:03 UTC,2015-12-17 00:24:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Dec. 16, 2015) The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for heavy rainfall Thursday morning that could create hazardous traveling conditions. <br /><br /> The National Weather Service has advised the Portland area should expect 3 inches of rain in 48 hours, with the heaviest precipitation coming from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Thursday. The Bureau advises people traveling by car, by public transit and by bike to expect wet roads and slippery conditions. <br /><br /> People driving are urged to use caution and slow down, especially when driving on wet roads. Slow down to avoid damaging nearby private property and splashing travelers who may be walking or biking. We urge people driving to not drive through standing water, especially near creeks and other bodies of water. Turn around safely and use an alternative route. <br /><br /> Travelers must obey road closure signs for their own safety and for the safety of PBOT crews. Driving through flooded roads could cause your vehicle to be swept away or stall in the middle of the high water. People driving who ignore street closures and drive through barricades face fines of up to $1000. As of Wednesday, only two roads are closed in Portland: SW Montgomery between SW Vista and SW 14th Avenue, and SW Hamilton near SW 39th Avenue. They are both closed for repairs from damaged caused by storms last week. City crews are prepared to close additional flooded streets if necessary. <br /><br /> In the event conditions prompt PBOT to close roads, the bureau will make that information available to the public. For the most current updates on road closures, follow PBOT's Twitter feed at <a href=""https://twitter.com/@PBOTinfo"">https://twitter.com/@PBOTinfo</a> A Twitter account is not necessary to view the listings. PBOT's website will also be updated at <a href=""/transportation/"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/</a> with weather-related road closures in Portland between the hours of 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. <br /><br /> Residents are advised to notify PBOT of debris, mud, rocks, trees, or branches blocking a road by calling our 24/7 maintenance dispatch hotline at 503-823-1700. <br /><br /> During a heavy rain event, many people may report the same incident. Residents may find it more convenient to report using the PDX Reporter App on Apple and Android smartphones. To report standing water on a roadway, use the category Plugged Storm Drain/Inlet. To report rock or mudslides or other debris blocking a travel lane, use the Debris in Roadway category. We strongly encourage the public to submit photos with their service requests, because that helps PBOT crews assess changing conditions as they respond to reports. <br /><br /> With leaves largely removed from city streets, road flooding that may occur may be the result of too much water in the system in too little time. <br /><br /> City crews have stocked sand pile and sand bag locations for any Portland resident or business owner who wants to protect their property from flood damage in the Fanno Creek and Johnson Creek watersheds. Sand and sand bags are provided at no charge; you must bring your own shovel. <br /><br /> The following locations are stocked: <br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>SE 88th Ave just south of Holgate Blvd in the parking lot at Lents Park,&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>SE 111th Ave and Harold St at the southeast corner of the intersection, and&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>SW 42nd Ave and Vermont St in the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> PBOT will have extra crews working overnight on Wednesday and during morning hours on Thursday. Crews are prepared for the need to clear debris from storm drains, unplug storm drains that have underground blockages and close travel lanes as needed. <br /><br /></p>

Use caution and look for people walking and bicycling who may be more difficult to see in low-light conditions. <br /> <br /> Some signals are returning to power and flashing red. Those are also treated as all-way stops. <br /> <br /> Portland General Electric crews are working on restoring power. PBOT crews are prepared to restore signal function when power is restored. <br /> <br /> It appears that an electrical equipment-related issue caused a fire on a utility pole, causing the outage, PGE said.

The bridge will need to be closed 24-hours a day until the work is completed. A detour route will be in place during the closure.</p>
<p>Also known as the Cedar Crossing Bridge, the structure is the only covered bridge in Multnomah County.</p>
<p>For preventive maintenance that will extend the life of the bridge, the deteriorated asphalt on the bridge deck surface will be removed. PBOT crews will install a waterproof membrane to prevent water from penetrating into the structure. Additional repair time may be needed if bridge deck timbers need to be replaced. The bridge deck surface will be resurfaced with asphalt.</p>
<p>Work has been scheduled for this time to coincide area school closures for the holiday season. The bridge is a key route for several school bus routes in the area.</p>
<p>Detours will be set up to help travelers through the area during the scheduled bridge closure.</p>
<p>Traffic traveling southbound on SE 134th/SE Deardorff Rd will be detoured west on Foster Road, then southbound on SE 110th Drive/SE 112th Avenue, to eastbound SE Flavel Street, to SE Deardorff Road. Traffic traveling northbound on SE Deardorff Road will be detoured west onto SE Flavel Street to northbound SE 112th /SE 110th, then to eastbound SE Foster Road.</p>
<p>Local access will be provided to residences on SE 134th between SE Foster Road and SE Deardorff Road.</p>
<p>The public is advised to expect delays, travel cautiously, observe closure signs, use the detour and alternate routes if possible. Advisory message boards were placed in the area earlier this week and will remain during the duration of the project.</p>

<p>This section of SE 52nd Avenue is a popular bike route, recently growing in use with the 50s Bikeway project which opened in 2014.</p>
<p>The roadway will not be completely closed. Expect intermittent delays and a rough travel surface.</p>
<p>Consider using alternate routes. Work hours likely will not affect evening rush hour, though morning peak hours may be affected. People riding bicycles should avoid the work zone, and either use alternate routes, open travel lanes or sidewalks.</p>
<p>The lane closures will allow crews to grind 1.47 lane miles of pavement in preparation for paving at a later date, dependent on weather conditions. This preventive maintenance preserves the life of the roadway and saves money by avoiding more costly reconstruction.</p>
<p>PBOT street maintenance crews work through the winter, adjusting tasks based on weather conditions. Crews will grind down old asphalt and prepare street surfaces for paving even in cold and rainy conditions. They will return to complete paving during a window of dry weather.</p>
<p>Lane closures are only in effect during project hours. Access will be maintained for businesses and residents during the project.</p>

The National Weather Service has issued a high wind warning for the Portland area until 4:00 p.m. today with wind between 25 to 40 MPH and peak gusts of 45 to 65 MPH. Winds of this strength could make travel hazardous. Saturated soils from recent rain combined with unusually strong winds can damage or even uproot some trees and lead to road hazards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) asks the traveling public, residents and businesses to take steps to reduce hazards associated with these conditions. Strong winds may bring fallen trees, tree limbs, and power lines in streets. Residents are advised to notify PBOT of debris, mud, rocks, trees, or branches blocking a road by calling our 24/7 maintenance dispatch hotline at 503-823-1700.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If travelers encounter a downed power line in the Portland area, they should report it to PGE at 503-464-7777. Never touch a downed power line. In fact, do not even get close. Even if a power line is not sparking, it could still be energized. Remember that water and electricity do not mix. Never try to free lines or to remove tree limbs from lines by yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a storm knocks out power to traffic signals, treat intersections like an all-way stop and proceed with caution. The driver who stops first has the right of way to go first.</p>

NW Germantown Road between Highway 30 and NW Skyline Boulevard, which was closed Sunday night because of downed trees and abandoned vehicles in the roadway, remains closed due to the continued risk of icy conditions. The roadway is expected to remain closed through Tuesday morning&rsquo;s rush hour. Local access will be maintained for residents in the area. The public is encouraged to use alternate routes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With temperatures expected to again drop to freezing this evening at high elevations in the Portland area, combined with already wet road surfaces, driving conditions can be hazardous.</p>

<p>Black ice is defined as ice that remains on roadways that are not subjected to direct sunlight. Black ice commonly forms on roads that wind around lakes and rivers, in tunnels, on overpasses and in highly shaded, rural areas. Black ice is almost invisible to the naked eye. Be especially careful when driving or riding into shaded areas, on bridges and overpasses, and on infrequently traveled roads. Slow down during your approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone choosing to drive at high elevations in Portland during winter weather is encouraged to use caution, slow down, allow three times the normal distance to brake and stop safely, use headlights and share the road responsibly.</p>

People who are not experienced at driving in snow or icy conditions should avoid driving. <br /> <br /> People driving are urged to use caution, slow down and do not abandon your vehicle in a travel lane. Vehicles blocking travel lanes can delay emergency responders and cause traffic congestion. <br /> <br /> In addition: <br /> * If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm.

To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044. <br /> <br /> * If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets. <br /> <br /> * If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives.

News,558987,"Severe Weather Advisory: PBOT urges public to use caution, clear sidewalks, do not abandon vehicles in winter conditions",1,,2016-01-07 21:46:48 UTC,2016-01-04 23:49:00 UTC,A,,"<div class=""WordSection1"">
<p>(4 p.m. Jan. 4, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for continued winter weather that may create hazardous traveling conditions overnight Monday night, into Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Snow and ice accumulations since Sunday have begun to thaw. But a forecast of low temperatures, Columbia Gorge winds and rain on Monday night means the public should continue to exercise caution, especially when driving on hills and in high-elevation areas. Local weather and road conditions will vary considerably across Portland, so expect that the conditions you find when traveling could worsen along your route.</p>
<p>As the area thaws, it is important to remember that property owners are responsible for sidewalks adjacent to private property and driveways, including the removal of snow, ice, slippery leaves, and other debris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all need to work together to clear the sidewalks by our homes and offices,&rdquo; Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;The traveling public, especially people with disabilities and people who depend on public transit, rely on clear sidewalks to access jobs and important services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PBOT will again have extra crews working overnight. They will use plows and trucks to clear slushy areas and break up ice, to help expedite drying of road surfaces. They also will look for trouble spots and will be prepared to close lanes or roads as needed.</p>
<p>PBOT urges the public to use public transit and biking and walking if you can avoid hills and high-elevation areas. People driving are urged to use caution, slow down and do not abandon your vehicle in a travel lane. Vehicles blocking travel lanes can delay emergency responders and cause traffic congestion.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm. Any abandoned vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to being cited and towed. To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets.</li>
<li>If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives. While you wait for help to arrive, open a window slightly for ventilation, run your motor sparingly, and use your emergency flashers.</li>
<li>Turn on your lights to increase your visibility to other travelers. Keep your lights and windshield clean. Don't use cruise control or overdrive on icy roads.</li>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Nike unveils BIKETOWN and innovative visual bike identity</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>With partnership in place, system set to grow 66 percent to 1000 bikes</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(January 7, 2016) &ndash; This morning, Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick, Nike Vice President of Global Community Impact Jorge Casimiro and Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat announced Nike as the title sponsor of the city&rsquo;s new bike share system. The <a href=""/transportation/article/559268"">agreement</a> is valued at $10 million and has an initial term of five years.</p>
<p>The partnership with Nike will allow the City to expand the initial number of bike share bicycles available to the public and puts the system on a trajectory of sustainable, long-term growth. When the Portland City Council voted unanimously to create Portland Bike Share last September, it authorized a system with 600 bikes. <a href=""/transportation/article/559268"">With Nike as title sponsor, the system will now launch with 1000 bikes, a 66 percent increase.</a></p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=559242"" alt=""BIKETOWN Front"" width=""350"" />The bike share program and bicycles will be called BIKETOWN, and Nike revealed the innovative visual identity for the program&rsquo;s standard bike at a press conference with city officials and community partners at its Portland Community Store in Northeast Portland. The store is near the site of a proposed bike share station. As part of the unique collaboration between Nike and the City of Portland, Nike will also oversee the design and branding of the system&rsquo;s logo, stations and digital presence.</p>
<p>In what City officials characterized as a first-of-its-kind commitment, Nike also announced plans to unveil a select number of additional limited edition bike wrap designs unique to Nike. These designs, to be shared at a later date, will reflect the city&rsquo;s creative spirit. This aspect of the partnership, along with the ability to bring 400 more bikes to the system, elevates Portland&rsquo;s bike share program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is how public-private partnerships should be done,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;We have developed an innovative, next generation bike share system. And in Nike, we have a sponsor that is a brand powerhouse and a global leader in innovation with a long and distinguished record of supporting sports and physical activity in Portland. It&rsquo;s a perfect fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=559245"" alt=""BIKETOWN side"" width=""550"" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud of our long history of partnership with the City of Portland and believe that the BIKETOWN bike share&nbsp; program is one more example of how we can work together to help make Portland an even more active, vibrant and innovative community &ndash; goals Nike and the City of Portland share,&rdquo; said Nike VP of Global Community Impact Jorge Casimiro. &ldquo;BIKETOWN is the perfect way to help Portland residents and visitors incorporate daily physical activity into their lives. We&rsquo;re thrilled to bring inspiration and innovation as a brand to get more people moving across this beautiful city so many of us call home.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commissioner Steve Novick and the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s dogged determination in making sure Portland has a bike share program is inspiring,&rdquo; said Congressman Earl Blumenauer, &ldquo;Nike, bike share, and Portland make a terrific team. While Portland may not be the first, with Nike&rsquo;s support and partnership, I have no doubt our program will be the best. I look forward to doing anything I can to assist in this exciting effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=559248"" alt=""BIKETOWN detail"" width=""350"" />&ldquo;This is a great day for bike share and a great day for Portland,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Developing a world-class bike share system was something I promised to Portlanders when I joined PBOT two years ago. With Nike as a sponsor, we&rsquo;re going to deliver on that promise in a huge way. I&rsquo;m excited because bike share is a proven tool to increase bicycling and because Portlanders and visitors alike will have another option for getting around our great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s bike share system is set to launch in July 2016. It will be operated by Motivate, a global leader in bike share. ""We are delighted to work with Nike and PBOT, two incredible partners, to bring the nation's most innovative bike share system to life,"" said Jay Walder, President and CEO of Motivate, the nation&rsquo;s preeminent urban bike share provider and the operator of BIKETOWN bike share. &ldquo;Thanks to Nike&rsquo;s dynamic collaboration, Portland will almost double the number of bikes available at its launch, adding to its already bike-friendly culture and attracting new people to take a ride.</p>
<p>Motivate manages all of the largest US bike share systems and many of the largest systems in the world, including Bay Area Bike Share (California Bay Area), Citi Bike (New York and Jersey City), Divvy (Chicago), Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.; Arlington and Alexandria, Va.; and Montgomery County, Md.), Hubway (Boston, Somerville, Cambridge and Brookline, Mass.), Pronto (Seattle) and Bike Share Toronto and Melbourne Bike Share in Australia.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s bike share bicycles will be supplied by Social Bicycles (SoBi), a transportation technology company based in Brooklyn, NY. SoBi revolutionized bike share by pioneering the smart-bike approach. Instead of relying on expensive docks and kiosks, SoBi places all the communications and locking technology on the bike itself.</p>
<p>With all of the communications and locking technology contained on the bicycles, Portland&rsquo;s system will make it easier to find, reserve and park a bike. The system will also be one of the most affordable in the country. The launch of the system has been financed with a $2 million federal grant approved by Metro Council in 2011. Expansion of the system from 600 to 1,000 bicycles and the operating costs will be financed by the $10 million sponsorship agreement. In addition, user revenues will help offset operation costs. No city money will be used for bike share operations.</p>

<p><em>Portland Bureau of Transportation</em></p>
<p>(January 15, 2016) -&nbsp;Staff from the Portland Bureau of Transportation's Traffic Engineering, Public Works and Signals and Streetlights teams were on the scene at SE 156th Avenue and Division Street on Thursday, following a pedestrian fatality at the location on Tuesday, January 12.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=560469"" alt=""marking beacons at 156th and division"" width=""275"" height=""154.916666667"" />Staff marked the road for a temporary Rapid Flashing Beacon to be installed at the crossing. Weather permitting, the new beacon will be operational by January 25th. The permanent fix, which includes installing a <a href=""/transportation/article/536725"">Hybrid Signal</a> and new crossing at 157th, is being expedited as well. During the visit a new LED street light on the south side of the crossing was installed and activated as well.&nbsp;The new street light immediately improves visibility for everyone at the crossing.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=560468"" alt=""Rapid Flash Beacon Map"" width=""300"" height=""383.90625"" />This beacon installation is in addition to&nbsp;the <a title=""Map of Rapid Flash Beacons in East Portland"" href=""/transportation/article/522936"">17 other beacons</a> installed as part of the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/68334"">East Portland Rapid Flash Beacon Project</a>. The project will improve pedestrian and bicycle crossing safety at arterial intersections in outer eastside Portland.&nbsp;The project implements safety improvement recommendations from the East Portland in Motion (EPIM) Plan, adopted by City Council in 2011. EPIM is a five year implementation strategy for enhancing active transportation in neighborhoods east of 82nd Ave, which identified over 80 priority construction projects and programs. Funding for the Rapid Flash Beacon Project comes from a grant from the State of Oregon through Representative Shemia Fagan.</p>
<p>Additional improvements are planned for SE Division as part of the East Portland Access to Transit project. These include sidewalk infill from 102nd to 145th and four additional Rapid Flash Beacons at 115th, 131st, 139th and 142nd. The project is currently in the design and engineering phase. It will also include the 130's <a href=""/transportation/50518"">Neighborhood Greenway</a>, which will cross SE Division at 157th. Once design and engineering is complete later this year, PBOT will submit the project to the Federal Highway Administration and ODOT for approval.<br /><br />Other major changes for this area of SE Division are likely to come from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.oregonmetro.gov/public-projects/powell-division-transit-and-development-project"" data-hovercard=""/ajax/hovercard/hovercard.php?id=327393720721296&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22hc_location%22%3A%22ufi%22%7D"">Powell-Division Transit and Development Project</a>.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p>Portland is a Vision Zero city (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.visionzeroportland.com</a>).

News,560775,News Release: Portland Bureau of Transportation to move forward with installation of long-awaited parking meters in Northwest Portland,1,,2016-01-20 23:46:34 UTC,2016-01-20 17:24:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(January 20, 2016) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced today that it will begin installing parking meters along and adjacent to NW 21<sup>st</sup> and NW 23<sup>rd</sup> from Burnside to NW Vaughn, a significant step toward implementing the NW Portland Parking Plan approved by City Council in 2013. &nbsp;Installation of the approximately 360 meters is set to begin on February 2, 2016, weather permitting.</p>
<p>With its significant density of residences, businesses and religious and educational institutions, Northwest Portland has faced the challenge of high-demand for parking. The new parking meters will be an important tool to help PBOT, in partnership with neighborhood stakeholders, to better manage the parking supply.</p>
<p>The Northwest Parking Plan was approved by City Council in July 2013. It was the result of a collaborative planning process between PBOT staff and local residents, business owners and other neighborhood representatives. The parking plan&rsquo;s first major phase was the implementation of a permit parking zone, Zone M, in March 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For quite some time, parking difficulties have negatively impacted livability and business vitality in this vibrant neighborhood,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;With the installation of the new meters, we are taking a systematic approach that will allow us to meet the parking needs of residents, businesses and visitors alike. It&rsquo;s a major step forward, and we believe this approach is a powerful tool we can potentially use to help alleviate the parking challenges in other high demand areas of Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The installation of the meters follows the conclusion of the City Attorney&rsquo;s review of the internal investigation by Cale Group, the parent company of Cale America, the city&rsquo;s meter supplier, into possible improprieties related to the Ellis McCoy bribery scandal. The City Attorney concluded that Cale Group had conducted a &ldquo;well-planned and thorough investigation&rdquo; into misconduct surrounding the original 2006 meter contract and had taken &ldquo;meaningful corrective action&rdquo; in response to the misconduct. Although it resulted in a delay in the meter installation, PBOT insisted on the review in order to ensure that the public could trust the integrity of the City&rsquo;s contract with Cale America.</p>
<p>In a letter, Cale America has also assured the City of Portland that if it becomes aware of any allegations of unlawful conduct in its business relationship with the City of Portland it will promptly investigate and take the appropriate corrective action.</p>

<p>As part of the Northwest Parking Plan, the majority of parking meter revenue will return to the district to finance improvements to the local transportation infrastructure. Over the next two weeks, PBOT will conduct stakeholder outreach to inform residents, business owners and visitors to the neighborhood about the coming changes.</p>

<p>(Jan. 29, 2016) &ndash;The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that downtown on-street parking rates will be $2 an hour, effective Monday Feb. 1, after approval by the Portland City Council and a recommendation from a stakeholder advisory committee.</p>
<p>PBOT uses meter rates to manage the supply of on-street parking, and by adjusting rates, PBOT can increase the supply of on-street parking in downtown, making it easier for Portlanders to visit and shop in the area.</p>
<p>The goal is to ensure that there are spaces available so people do not have to spend time circling the block looking for parking. Excessive circling adds to traffic congestion and harms the environment.</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s goal is to have on-street parking occupancy rates lower than 85 percent. Such a rate ensures that spaces will be available for the next customer. A study of downtown parking rates found many areas of downtown that exceeded the critical 85 percent benchmark. In some areas, parking occupancy tops out above 95 percent.</p>
<p>The new rate is the first change to downtown meter rates since 2009. Public transit fares and off-street parking rates both increased since then. Rates for PBOT&rsquo;s six SmartPark garages, which offer nearly 4,000 parking spaces to the public, are not affected by Monday&rsquo;s new meter rates.</p>
<p>Downtown parking meters operate from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday, unless otherwise posted.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href=""/transportation/article/562506"">Frequently Asked Questions</a> on PBOT&rsquo;s web site.</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s SmartPark garages are normally open 24 hours, seven days a week, except for the O&rsquo;Bryant Square garage, which operates 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>The six PBOT SmartPark parking garages include nearly 4,000 public parking spaces and serve shoppers, business clients and visitors to Downtown Portland. For more information about SmartPark garages, see: www.portlandoregon.gov/smartpark.</p>

<p><em>""More than 95% of the injuries I see are entirely preventable,"" says Michael Morrison, B.S.N.</em></p>
<p><em>By Hannah Schafer</em></p>
<p><em>Portland Bureau of Transportation</em></p>
<p>(February 1, 2016) -&nbsp;Portlanders deserve safe streets on which to walk, bike, operate mobility devices, access transit, and drive. The Portland Bureau of Transportation aims to make our transportation system the safest possible and to move towards zero traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries in the next 10 years. This effort is known as Vision Zero.</p>
<p>Achieving <a href=""/transportation/40390"">Vision Zero</a> requires the input of a diverse group of partners from across the city and uses a variety of tools to inform the strategies for achieving this important goal. Our community-wide effort now includes Portland&rsquo;s Police and Fire Bureaus, regional and state government and partners in emergency response, public health and community organizations.</p>
<p>Task Force member Michael Morrison, B.S.N., has been a critical care nurse for the past 39 years. A graduate of the OHSU School of Nursing in 1977, Michael currently works as a trauma nurse at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, a Level I Trauma Center, where he cares for patients in the Neuro-Trauma Intensive Care and responds to incoming patients as part of the resuscitation team in the emergency and operating rooms. In short, says Michael, &ldquo;Most of my career has been on the frontlines of dealing with the aftermath of injuries and fatalities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to bedside patient care, he is a coordinator for <a href=""http://legacyhealth.org/health-services-and-information/health-services/for-adults-a-z/trauma/trauma-nurses-talk-tough.aspx"">Legacy Health Trauma Nurses Talk Tough</a> (TNTT). TNTT is a nationally recognized injury prevention program and recipient of the prestigious NOVA award from the American Hospital Association. As a national leader, TNTT has developed several unique traffic safety classes. Michael partnered with community traffic safety advocates to develop the <a href=""http://www.legacyhealth.org/health-services-and-information/health-services/for-adults-a-z/trauma/trauma-nurses-talk-tough/court-ordered-classes/high-risk-driver-class.aspx"">High Risk Driver Class</a> and the <a href=""http://www.legacyhealth.org/health-services-and-information/health-services/for-adults-a-z/trauma/trauma-nurses-talk-tough/court-ordered-classes/share-the-road-safety-class.aspx"">Share the Road Safety Class</a>. Says Michael, &ldquo;As we improve our medical care in saving lives and reducing the consequences of injury, the most valuable health care approach is prevention. More than 95% of the injuries I see are entirely preventable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael helped pioneer Legacy&rsquo;s Bicycle Helmet Program that has distributed more than 130,000 low cost and free helmets since 1992 in the Portland metropolitan area. Michael raised five children; bicycling for fun and commuting is still a part of their lives.</p>
<p>Says Michael about serving on the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Task Force, &ldquo;It is an honor for me to work with community leaders, law enforcement, safety advocates and traffic safety planners on the Vision Zero Task Force. Reaching the goal of Vision Zero is achievable with a diverse group of community partners leading the way. Public involvement can significantly reduce injuries and minimize fatalities; I am proud to be sharing in this effort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <a href=""/transportation/68398"">Vision Zero Task Force</a> is charged with providing direction on the Portland Vision Zero Action Plan, including developing the vision, goals, policies, actions, performance measures, and recommendations to get to zero traffic fatalities and serious injuries.

These students learn the keys to safe walking and biking as a fundamental part of their academic curriculum.</p>
<p>Many of these children are from Title IA schools. Title IA schools receive additional federal funding for serving a significant number of students facing risk factors such as poverty and unstable housing. The BTA teaches Bike and Pedestrian Safety Education in 21 out of the 24 Portland Public Schools that fit this classification.</p>
<p>A high number of students at these schools do not have access to bicycles, and live in neighborhoods where there are limited sidewalks and signage. Bike and Pedestrian Safety Education is an essential component of keeping these students and their families' safe as they travel to and from their local schools.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=563841"" alt=""students on community bike ride"" width=""300"" height=""225"" />Teachers and administrators agree these programs are important. Fifth grade teacher from Marysville School, Kelly Joy says ""[Bike safety] is a skill they will take with them for a lifetime. I saw such a sense of confidence develop once they learned the rules of the road."" Fifth grade Spanish immersion teacher at Rigler School, Risa Nabielski adds, ""Bike safety is such a fun and meaningful activity for our students. For some, it is their first time on a bike; they are the ones that really benefit!""</p>
<p>Safe Routes to School and the BTA are always looking for volunteers to assist on school community rides and other efforts.

News,563988,News Release: PBOT’s 2015 Traffic Safety Report reinforces need for action to reduce serious and fatal crashes on Portland’s streets,1,,2016-02-09 18:07:19 UTC,2016-02-08 21:32:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=563987"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />(Feb. 8, 2016) &ndash; The newly improved crosswalk at SE 156<sup>th</sup> and Division Street was dedicated this morning in a short ceremony that also acknowledged the three fatalities that occurred at the location in recent years. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), along with Oregon &amp; Southwest Washington Families for Safe Streets and Oregon Walks, met at the new Rapid Flashing Beacon to discuss why the safety improvements at the crossing and other Vision Zero actions are so important for the people of Portland. Following the most recent fatality on January 12, 2016, PBOT added a temporary Rapid Flashing Beacon - the first in a series of changes PBOT will be making to this area. In addition to the temporary beacon, a hybrid beacon one block east at 157<sup>th</sup> will be installed and the TriMet bus stop will be relocated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT also released its<a href=""/transportation/article/563991""> 2015 Portland Traffic Safety Report </a>which includes data on the number of traffic-related fatalities in 2015 and discusses trends and key contributing factors. <a href=""/transportation/article/563991"">Among the report&rsquo;s findings</a>, PBOT found that <a href=""/transportation/54892"">High Crash Corridors</a>, which represent just 3% of Portland&rsquo;s road network, were the site of 27% of the traffic fatalities in 2015. SE Division Street is one of Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Corridors. In 2015, 9 of the city&rsquo;s traffic fatalities were in East Portland, of which 3 were pedestrian fatalities. In addition, 54% of fatal crashes in Portland in 2015 included at least one person who was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a Vision Zero City we are committed to the idea that every death or serious injury on our streets is one too many,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Our 2015 report makes it clear why Portland needs a comprehensive safety initiative like Vision Zero. All Portlanders deserve safe streets and that&rsquo;s why the Portland Bureau of Transportation is so committed to implementing Vision Zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pedestrian safety is a high priority for PBOT, especially on arterial roadways, where data shows people are most at risk. As most pedestrian fatalities occur when pedestrians are crossing the street, PBOT is focusing its Vision Zero efforts on improving crossing safety. With the help of federal grants, state funds, and local partnerships the Bureau is rolling out a significant number of crossing improvements utilizing Rapid Flashing Beacons on roadways throughout East Portland. In the coming weeks, PBOT will be activating additional flashing beacons all across East Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to these infrastructure improvements, the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Task Force continues to move forward with prioritizing the safety actions that the City will take to reduce fatalities and serious injuries in Portland. The Vision Zero Task Force, with members from Portland&rsquo;s Police and Fire Bureaus, regional and state government and partners in emergency response, public health and community organizations &ndash; including Oregon Walks and Oregon and SW Washington Families for Safe Streets - will be targeting a wide range of issues including DUII, infrastructure improvements and policy. The next Task Force meeting is on February 25.</p>

News,564180,News Release: Traffic enforcement and education action on SE Clinton Street to highlight safety on neighborhood greenways,1,,2016-02-09 22:51:43 UTC,2016-02-09 22:32:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(February 9, 2016) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau advise the traveling public that a traffic education and enforcement action is scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 10 on SE Clinton Street between SE 12<sup>th</sup> Avenue and SE 50<sup>th</sup> Avenue from 7 to 9:30 a.m. and from 3 to 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The action is part of the project to enhance the <a href=""/transportation/68514"">Clinton Neighborhood Greenway</a> and make it more inviting for people who are walking and biking. As part of the overall improvement of the Clinton Neighborhood Greenway, PBOT installed two traffic diverters on SE Clinton Street at SE 17th Avenue and SE 32nd Avenue in early January. During public meetings to discuss the project last year, community members asked PBOT to initiate an education and enforcement campaign to make people driving aware of the unique role that neighborhood greenways play in encouraging walking and biking. Police and PBOT collaborated on an enforcement action Dec. 15, before the diverters were installed, and are returning for additional enforcement now that the diverters have been in place for a month.</p>
<p>The Portland City Council has also made a commitment to protect and enhance the city&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways.</p>
<p>During the enforcement action, the Portland Police Bureau will be on the lookout for violations that threaten the safety of people walking and biking. These violations include people driving who violate &ldquo;do not enter- except bicycles&rdquo; sign, illegal and unsafe U-turns, and people driving vehicles (including scooters and motorcycles) through the new diverters.&nbsp;Police will also monitor stop sign compliance on streets surrounding Clinton, including the SE Woodward and 32<sup>nd</sup> Avenue intersection.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways are where people of all ages and abilities have the opportunity to bicycle, walk and play. As such, neighborhood greenways need to maintain low motor vehicle volumes and speeds, provide protected crossings at major intersections, and create an environment that encourages people of all ages to travel actively. Between SE 12th Avenue and SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard, traffic volumes currently exceed the upper acceptable limit of 2,000 cars per day by 200 to 1,000 cars. Much of this traffic is believed to be non-local cut-through traffic that should be using either SE Division Street or SE Powell Boulevard.

<p>(February 11, 2016) - Wednesday&rsquo;s traffic enforcement and education action by the Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau on SE Clinton Street between SE 12th Avenue and SE 50th Avenue generated 15 citations and 6 warnings for people driving motor vehicles and 2 warnings to people biking with no lighting. Officers from PPB also distributed Vision Zero pamphlets with information about safe travel for people who walk, bike and/or drive with every traffic stop.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=564538"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""108"" height=""108"" />During the enforcement action, police were on the lookout for violations that threatened the safety of people walking and biking. These violations included people driving who violated &ldquo;do not enter- except bicycles&rdquo; sign, illegal and unsafe U-turns, and people driving vehicles (including scooters and motorcycles) through the new diverters. Police also monitored stop sign compliance on streets surrounding Clinton, including the SE Woodward and 32nd Avenue intersection.</p>
<p>The stops were primarily for Failing to Obey a Traffic Control Device. Three charges were for Illegal U-Turn. All three of those were for people in vehicles who turned right at the SE 17th Street diverter, made a U-Turn and then retuned to make another right to continue along SE Clinton. The last contact of the day was at the SE Clinton and SE 17th diverter at approximately 11:00 p.m. when a person driving was arrested for DUII (.14 BAC).</p>
<p>The enforcement action was a component of the education and outreach program for the Clinton Neighborhood Greenway Enhancement Project, whose goal is to address auto volume and speed issues and make the greenway more inviting for people who are walking and biking. During the public meetings to discuss the project, community members asked PBOT to initiate an education and enforcement campaign to make drivers aware of the unique role that neighborhood greenways play in encouraging walking and biking. The Portland City Council has also made a commitment to protect and enhance the city&rsquo;s neighborhood greenways.</p>

News,564544,News Advisory: Crosswalk and midblock education and enforcement action planned for SE 82nd Avenue Feb. 17,1,,2016-02-11 21:49:05 UTC,2016-02-11 21:00:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Feb 11, 2016) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau will conduct an intersection crosswalk and midblock crossing safety education and enforcement action on Wednesday, Feb. 17 at the marked crosswalk on SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue at SE Division Street and on SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue between SE Division and SE Harrison streets from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws.</p>
<p>Southeast 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and SE Division Street are designated High Crash Corridors because they have a high number of fatalities and injuries. From 2004 through 2015, there were 24 pedestrian crashes at or near SE 82 Avenue and SE Division Street and 2 pedestrian fatalities.</p>
<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Feb. 17 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>During the education and enforcement action, police officers will remind drivers to stop appropriately for the pedestrian in the crossing, encourage people walking to cross at the corner, and enforce Oregon traffic laws. Portland Community College (PCC) Southeast students and PBOT staff will hand out brochures to people who are crossing midblock, to encourage them to cross at the intersection.</p>
<p>Many people on foot and in vehicles cross this section of the roadway every day going to and from bus stops, restaurants and coffees shops, PCC Southeast Campus, businesses and other retail outlets.&nbsp; Approximately 26,100 vehicles travel on SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue between SE Division and SE Harrison each day.&nbsp; Most people walking use the marked crosswalk at SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and SE Division Street. However, some people choose to cross SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue midblock between SE Division and SE Harrison instead.</p>
<p>Crossing midblock at locations without enhanced crossing features can put people on foot and behind the wheel at risk of a crash, especially if the roadway has multiple travel lanes, high traffic volumes and high vehicle speeds.</p>
<p>Crossing at the corner is safer for people who walk because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers are expecting pedestrian to cross at the corner.</li>
<li>The view of a person crossing midblock is often blocked by other vehicles -- a secondary threat exists when one driver stops for the pedestrian but the next driver may or may not see the person walking and does not stop or cannot stop in time to allow for safe crossing.</li>
<li>The traffic signal at SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and SE Division Street will control the flow of traffic and provide a specific time for pedestrians to cross.</li>
<li>The intersection is illuminated to provide optimal visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>PBOT encourages everyone who uses 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and SE Division Street to exercise care and caution when walking, biking and driving. Both people that drive and people that walk should remain alert and watch for people in the crossing and drivers that may be turning onto or from 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue.&nbsp; When vehicle drivers make a turn at an intersection with a signal, they must stop and stay stopped for pedestrians when they are less than 6 feet from the lane into which the driver&rsquo;s vehicle is turning (ORS 814.010).</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=564543"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""178"" height=""178"" />Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday Parkways is a great celebration of Portland,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;It connects our neighborhoods and inspires people to try biking and walking for fun, health and transportation. After trying Sunday Parkways, Portlanders often add biking and walking to their daily lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sunday Parkways is a series of free community events opening the city's largest public space&mdash;its streets&mdash;for people to walk, bike, roll and discover active transportation. The events are hugely popular. Total attendance in 2015 set a record 119,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunday Parkways is a unique event for folks to discover and explore a neighborhood in the more intimate way that walking and biking allows,&rdquo; Milwaukie Mayor Mark Gamba said. &ldquo;Milwaukie is excited to welcome people from across the metro region to come explore our cool little city and some of what it has to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizers emphasize the ways people can create the Sunday Parkways experience every day. All five Sunday Parkways routes showcase low-traffic streets called neighborhood greenways as well as City parks ideal for bicycling and walking.&nbsp;The Sellwood/Milwaukie route in October will introduce participants to the expanded biking and walking paths on the new Sellwood Bridge. This Sunday Parkways route will also show how to safely, easily and conveniently use this new option to head into Portland, and it helps Portlanders discover the growing city of Milwaukie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland loves Sunday Parkways and we&rsquo;re sure Milwaukie will too,&rdquo; Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;With the help of longtime presenting sponsor Kaiser Permanente, our community comes together to embrace our streets as livable space that everyone can enjoy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(March 9, 2016) &ndash; A new website was unveiled today that will allow Portlanders to lend their voices to the BIKETOWN bike share station siting process. Through the website,&nbsp;the public can provide feedback on 300 proposed station locations in the BIKETOWN service area. This feedback will then be used by PBOT and Motivate to select the final 100 station locations. These stations will be installed ahead of the BIKETOWN launch in July 2016.</p>
<p>The BIKETOWN system will include 1,000 bikes available at 100 stations. Although Portland&rsquo;s &lsquo;smart bike&rsquo; system will allow people to park anywhere within the service area for an additional fee, BIKETOWN stations will be the primary places where people can rent and return the bikes.</p>
<p>An analysis of residential density, employment density, transit demand, recreation demand and major city attractions was used by PBOT and Motivate to determine the BIKETOWN service area. The station siting within the service area follows a detailed criteria that includes elements such as: visibility, solar exposure, cellular/GPS reception, proximity to transit and bike routes and proximity to affordable housing.</p>
<p>In addition to the website, Portlanders are invited to attend any of the five open houses offered by PBOT to ask questions and provide in-person feedback about station locations. The open house dates and locations are:</p>

News,568766,News Release: Reduced Rate Swing Shift Pass for SmartPark Garages to Provide Improved Access for Low-Income Downtown Workers,1,,2016-03-10 22:47:00 UTC,2016-03-10 22:41:00 UTC,A,,"<blockquote>
<p>(March 10, 2016) &ndash; A new Reduced Rate Swing Shift Pass Program for the City of Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s SmartPark Garages starts on April 1, 2016. The new parking pass will give people with an annual income of less than $35,000 and who work a swing and/or evening shift a reduced rate at SmartPark Garages between 3 p.m. and 7 a.m.</p>
<p>The new reduced rate is $35 per month and will apply at all SmartPark Garages except for the O&rsquo;Bryant Square Garage, which is closed in the evenings. The non-reduced swing-shift rate ranges between $90 and $100 per month.</p>
<p>The Reduced Rate Swing Shift pass is a direct response to stakeholder concerns about the impact of new downtown on-street parking rates on lower-income workers. On February 1, 2016, the City increased the on-street parking rate in Downtown from $1.60 to $2.00 per hour. During the discussion of this increase, stakeholders focused attention on how this increase could negatively affect downtown employees earning low wages, working swing or evening shifts and who are not well served by available transit options. To mitigate this impact, the SmartPark Program developed the new monthly pass. The program will provide a reasonable, low-cost option to lower income workers while leaving readily accessible on-street parking spaces available for evening customers and visitors.</p>
<p>""When I learned from the Committee that on-street parking occupancy had reached 95% in some areas of the Central City, I agreed that something needed to be done,"" said Commissioner Steve Novick. ""During this process, committee members asked PBOT to consider the effect on workers earning low wages and working swing and evening shifts. This new monthly pass shows the importance of an effective committee.""</p>
<p>Said PBOT Director Leah Treat, ""As our city grows and parking demands increase, we must ensure that the needs of all Portlanders are taken into account. This new program creates additional flexibility for downtown Portland parking, while supporting the employees who are so important to our city&rsquo;s economy.""</p>
<p>""Folks that work downtown doing janitorial and similar work simply can&rsquo;t afford the cost of parking on the low wages we make. It costs us over $100 per month, which is more than any of us can afford.&nbsp;I personally have had to pay over $5000 in parking costs, just to be able to work!"" said Joe Huggins, Lead Janitor for ABM Janitorial at the Pittock Block and Member of SEIU 49.&nbsp;""Increasing the cost of parking again could have been a real hardship.&nbsp; I appreciate the city officials working with us to make this pass a reality. It is encouraging to see our City stepping up and doing the right thing for low wage workers across Portland.""</p>
<p>A downloadable application for the Reduced Rate Swing Shift Pass Program can be found on the City&rsquo;s SmartPark website (<a href=""/smartpark"" target=""_blank"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.portlandoregon.gov/smartpark&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1457736137749000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFsMiBRoub7gsTXbt4qkqrMyluV1A"">www.portlandoregon.gov/smartpark</a>) under &ldquo;Monthly Parking&rdquo;.

News,569815,News Blog: What's happening on Foster Road?,1,,2016-10-05 19:58:46 UTC,2016-03-17 20:34:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=569814"" alt=""Vision Zero"" width=""150"" height=""150"" />(March 17, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is moving forward with the <a href=""/transportation/57866"">Foster Road Transportation and Streetscape Project</a>. We are currently finalizing the engineering and design phase and expect to complete it by fall 2016. We anticipate construction to begin in early 2017.</p>
<p>Currently, SE Foster Road is designated a High Crash Corridor with over 1,200 crashes and 8 fatalities reported in the last 10 years. As a <a href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/"">Vision Zero</a> city, we aim to make our transportation system the safest possible and to move towards zero traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries in the next 10 years. In order to improve safety on Foster, PBOT is reallocating the roadway to create three motor vehicle lanes, bicycle lanes and on-street parking on both sides of the street. The change will extend from SE 54<sup>th</sup> to SE 90<sup>th</sup> Avenues. This change is expected to reduce all types of crashes by a minimum of 20 percent. Recent road realignments on other corridors in Portland have seen an average crash reduction of 37 percent.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" style=""; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 13.2px; line-height: 17.16px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=569813"" alt=""Foster before and after"" width=""250"" height=""428.759894459"" />In addition to reducing crashes, the changes on Foster Road will help turn it into a successful Main Street by providing greater accessibility for all modes and a safer and attractive corridor that supports businesses and neighborhoods. This will be achieved by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widening the sidewalks in Lents from five feet to nine feet</li>
<li>Adding street trees and lights</li>
<li>Installing marked protected crossings and curb extensions</li>
<li>Adding transit shelters</li>
<li>No major impact to existing on-street parking along the corridor</li>
<li>Adding bike lanes and connecting them to existing bike lanes in Lents Town Center and SE 52<sup>nd</sup> Avenue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How will the changes affect traffic on Foster?</strong></p>
<p>During most of the day, Foster Road will have enough capacity to accommodate current and future traffic volumes, except for the AM and PM peak periods at some key intersections. The reconfiguration to three motor vehicle lanes will not lead to congestion during most of the day. PBOT anticipates that travel times during peak hours will increase by up to 3 minutes to travel the entire corridor. This change is supported by our Vision Zero data-driven focus on where serious injuries and fatalities are occurring in Portland. By reducing the risk of collisions (and the congestion they cause), travel time on Foster Road will be more reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who supports this project?</strong></p>
<p>The project is the result of a 16 month planning process that has demonstrated strong community support from businesses, neighborhoods, local schools, local organizations and hundreds of residents. PBOT held five open houses with over 450 people attending. In addition, over 430 people filled out a survey with 80 percent supporting the plan. PBOT&rsquo;s public outreach also included culturally specific outreach to communities of color and English as a second language speakers within the neighborhood. The <a href=""http://www.fosterroadpdx.com/"">Foster Area Business Association</a> voted unanimously to support the plan in 2014 and urged Portland City Council to pass it.</p>
<p>Portland City Council unanimously approved the Foster Transportation and Streetscape plan at a public hearing in June of 2014. Since then, PBOT has been diligently working to design and engineer the project. We expect to complete those plans in fall 2016 and look forward to beginning construction in early 2017. We are grateful to the Foster Area Business Association for their work reaching out to all businesses on the street to educate and support them through the coming changes.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/569815

News,570039,"News Release: Mayor Hales, Commissioner Novick say recent traffic fatalities underscore urgency of Vision Zero, safety improvements",1,,2016-03-31 21:26:30 UTC,2016-03-21 18:29:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(March 21, 2016) - After three traffic crashes killed two people and seriously injured one more this past weekend, Portland Mayor Charlie Hales and Commissioner Steve Novick today reiterated the City of Portland&rsquo;s commitment to ending traffic fatalities and urged the public to take steps to reduce crashes.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=570040"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""175"" height=""175"" />Including this weekend&rsquo;s crashes, Portland has had eight fatalities in traffic crashes this year. Each of these fatalities is a major tragedy for families in our community and include three people walking, three in motor vehicles, one on bicycle and one on motorcycle. In fatal crashes on SE Center Street&nbsp;and NE Cully Boulevard, Portland Police arrested two drivers on several charges including Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicants, a contributing factor that concerns city leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our community is committed to achieving Vision Zero by eliminating deaths and serious injuries on our streets,&rdquo; said Mayor Hales, who oversees the Portland Police Bureau. &ldquo;More than half of Portland&rsquo;s traffic fatalities involve DUII. This weekend's tragedies remind us why no one should drive under the influence, and all Portlanders should follow the rules of the road, including speed limits. These personal choices directly affect neighbors and families. Make the right choice. Don't drink and drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City of Portland has committed to Vision Zero, adopting the goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries. The Vision Zero approach says that all traffic crashes are preventable with the right combination of efforts to address engineering, education, traffic enforcement and public engagement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our deepest sympathies go out to the families and communities affected by the crashes over the weekend,&rdquo; said Commissioner Novick, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;Any time we have a fatal or serious injury crash, it has a terrible impact on families, friends and the broader community. People may feel less safe and less comfortable traveling in their neighborhoods when they hear of these preventable tragedies. This City Council has made historic investments in traffic safety, including millions of dollars for sidewalks and safer crossings on 122nd Avenue that will enable to significantly improved transit service in the area. But clearly we need to do more, and I remain firmly committed to improving transportation safety, especially in areas such as East Portland, where historically underserved communities brave some of our city&rsquo;s most dangerous roadways. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three weekend crashes raised renewed concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Friday, a 35-year old woman was walking across NE Glisan Street at 117th Avenue when she was struck by a an eastbound car. The driver of the vehicle has been cooperating with investigators.</li>
<li>On Saturday, a 17-year-old boy was killed while riding a bicycle at SE Center Street and 142nd Avenue. The driver of a Dodge Dakota pickup that struck him is being held on DUII and other charges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>On Saturday, a 58-year-old man was killed while crossing NE Cully Boulevard at NE Mason Street. The driver of a 2012 Honda Insight that struck him is being held on DUII and other charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Portland had 37 traffic fatalities, including 20 people in cars and trucks, five on motorcycles, two on bicycles, and 10 people walking. Portland Bureau of Transportation found that 54 percent of fatal crashes that year included at least one person who was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to the 2015 Portland Traffic Safety Report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the City Council adopted Vision Zero, PBOT has been adding safety improvements to City streets and working with other local agencies to find better data that can improve our understanding of the underlying causes of traffic crashes. In recent years, PBOT has installed more than 20 rapid flashing beacons at crosswalks in East Portland, installed 14 more since last summer, and has plans for 15 additional beacons in the coming year. The bureau is building sidewalks and other improvements on High Crash Corridors such as 122nd Avenue and East Burnside Street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Bureau of Transportation is working with the Portland Police Bureau and Vision Zero Task Force with diverse areas of expertise, including law enforcement, education, public health and emergency response.</p>

<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=570445"" alt=""Duncan Hwang APANO"" width=""250"" height=""375.732421875"" /></p>
<p>As a child of immigrants, Duncan Hwang grew up in Chinese restaurants in rural Michigan. He moved to Portland in 2004 to attend Lewis &amp; Clark Law School. After graduating in 2007, Duncan worked throughout Asia in corporate law, but decided to return to his roots in community organizing and advocacy upon returning stateside. Duncan found a job at the <a href=""http://www.apano.org/"">Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon (APANO)</a> on Idealist.org and now serves as the Associate Director, living and working in the East Portland neighborhoods he hopes to serve.&nbsp; At APANO, Duncan has the privilege to advocate for the health, safety, and well-being of Portland's communities of concern. He is also a member of the <a href=""/transportation/68398"">City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Task Force</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.apano.org/"">APANO</a>&nbsp;is a statewide, grassroots organization, uniting Asians and Pacific Islanders to achieve social justice. APANO uses its collective strengths to advance equity through empowering, organizing and advocating with the communities they serve. A large portion of APANO&rsquo;s priority communities reside very close to their headquarters along SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue, but the organization works statewide to address disparities in health, education, and economic outcomes for their communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called the &ldquo;Avenue of Roses&rdquo;, 82nd Avenue is designated by PBOT as a <a href=""/transportation/54892"">High Crash Corridor</a> and it is designated by the Oregon Department of Transportation as State Highway 213. A major north/south connector route, the 82nd Avenue of Roses serves Portland&rsquo;s busiest transit line and has a large pedestrian population utilizing the corridor. A sizeable portion of the corridor&rsquo;s residents and businesses speak English as a second language. As the Vision Zero Task Force continues to examine methods for reducing serious injuries and fatalities in Portland, High Crash Corridors like 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue are a major focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-center""><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=570458"" alt=""SE 82nd and Foster"" width=""600"" height=""400.3125"" /><em>Portlanders crossing SE 82nd Avenue at Foster Road.&nbsp;</em><em>Photo by Felicity J. Mackay, PBOT</em></p>
<p class=""content-left"">Twenty-five&nbsp;corridors make up Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Network, streets with the highest number of people dying and being seriously injured.&nbsp; The&nbsp;High Crash&nbsp;Network&nbsp;makes&nbsp;up only&nbsp;7% of the road network, but&nbsp;accounts for&nbsp;47% of&nbsp;people dying (Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles crash data, 2004-2013). From 2004&nbsp;to 2013, ten people died in traffic crashes on 82<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Avenue, seven were people walking and one person was bicycling. In 2014, the intersection of SE 82<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Avenue and SE Division Street was the 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;highest crash location in Portland with a total of 124&nbsp;crashes from 2011&nbsp;to 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Says Duncan, ""SE 82nd is the most dangerous corridor in the City's pedestrian high crash network. With many Asian Pacific Islanders and other communities of concern now living along 82nd and other high crash corridors in East Portland, pedestrian safety and walkability has risen to the top of our concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>APANO's community development program focuses on SE Portland, particularly the Jade District and Lents neighborhoods. They manage the Jade District Neighborhood Prosperity Initiative for the City of Portland, which is literally boxed in by high crash corridors: SE Division, SE Powell and SE 82nd Ave. During an extensive community visioning process and design charette done in five languages, the overarching community concern was walkability and safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our neighborhoods are facing a public health crisis in the form of unsafe and incomplete streets, with preventable injuries and deaths unnecessarily tearing apart our families. Many of our community members have been impacted by dangerous streets and Vision Zero is an initiative APANO has high hopes for.&rdquo; Says Duncan, &ldquo;Getting to Vision Zero is a major equity priority that we're excited the City is taking so seriously.""</p>

<p>And finally, <strong><a href=""http://www.bcbs.com/why-bcbs/walkingworks/national-walklunch-day.html"">National Walk@Lunch Day</a> happens on Wednesday, April 27</strong>. Invite your coworkers or classmates to join you for a walk at lunch and help encourage a new daily walking routine that will improve your health step by step.</p>
<p>We encourage you to find ways to replace just a few driving trips per week with a walking trip. <strong>Walking is one of the easiest, most effective activities you can do</strong> to improve your health. The American Heart Association recommends 30 minutes of walking a day &ndash; and it doesn&rsquo;t all have to be at once.

<ul>

</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action highlights the recent completion of several East Portland crossing improvements and underscores the need for everyone to exercise caution and remain attentive to all road-users. The intersection is also the site of one of 16 rapid flash beacons (RFBs) newly constructed and activated in East Portland. Planning, design, and construction was made possible with $1.9 million secured by Representative Fagan and her legislative colleagues in the 2014 legislative session.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=572121"" alt=""Commissioner Novick at Vision Zero event"" width=""250"" height=""166.748046875"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;As Commissioner in Charge of the Bureau of Transportation, safety is my highest priority,&rdquo; said Commissioner Novick. &ldquo;Every Portlander should be able to safely commute throughout our community&mdash;whether while driving, walking or biking. By partnering with our legislative leaders and local advocates, like the East Portland Action Plan, we&rsquo;re able to leverage resources and prioritize new safety improvements that will make crossing the street safer and easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, we are celebrating the collaboration and hard work of legislators, City staff and East Portland Action Plan members who work to improve the safety of everyone in our community,&rdquo; added Representative Reardon.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">Representative Vega Pederson, who helped secure the funding for these recent safety improvement projects stated, &ldquo;The addition of rapid flash beacons, along with the funding we secured in the 2015 and 2016 Legislative Sessions, are great steps towards improving the safety and infrastructure in East Portland. Still, given that over 13 tragic fatalities have occurred this year so far, it is clear that more needs to be done &ndash; particularly to protect residents that walk or bike through our community.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=572127"" alt=""Transportation Director Leah Treat"" width=""250"" height=""166.666666667"" />&ldquo;For all of us who are committed to safe streets, these have been a very rough few months. We cannot and we will not accept this level of tragedy on our streets,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We know that we cannot achieve our Vision Zero goals alone. That is why I am very thankful for the support of our leaders in the state legislature, our Transportation Commissioner, our partners at the Portland Police Bureau and our dedicated community safety advocates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crossing improvements and 16 newly activated RFBs in East Portland are the result of a strong partnership between community advocates and planners who worked to prioritize safe improvement projects in the East Portland in Motion (EPIM) Plan. EPIM is a five year implementation strategy for enhancing active transportation in neighborhoods east of 82nd Ave., which identified over 80 priority construction projects and programs.</p>
<p>Of these priorities, State funding made improvements at the following East Portland intersections possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>SE Foster Rd &amp; 120th</li>
<li>NE Glisan &amp; 141st</li>
<li>SE Stark St &amp; 113th Ave</li>
<li>SE 122nd Ave &amp; Stephens</li>

<li>NE 122nd &amp; Russell</li>
<li>NE 102nd Ave Wygant</li>
<li>NE Halsey &amp; 106th Ave (to be constructed in conjunction with park improvements)</li>
</ul>
<p>The new rapid flash beacons in East Portland come a year after the City of Portland adopted Vision Zero, a traffic safety initiative that rejects the notion that traffic crashes are simply &ldquo;accidents,&rdquo; but instead preventable incidents that can and must be systematically addressed. Education and enforcement actions conducted by PBOT and Portland Police are also a key part of the Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>During the education and enforcement action, police officers and PBOT staff will remind drivers to stop appropriately for pedestrians in the crossing and encourage people walking to cross at the corner and, when available, utilize rapid flash beacons to alert drivers to yield to pedestrians. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk or pedestrians who jaywalk may be issued a warning or citation by the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving, walking and biking.

<p>(April 11, 2016)&nbsp; &ndash; Today is the start of National Work Zone Awareness Week. The initiative, sponsored by federal, state and local transportation officials each April, draws attention to the safety needs of road workers at the start of construction season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In observance of the week, the Portland Bureau of Transportation calls on the traveling public to use extra caution in work zones. PBOT will be sharing photos and stories of the bureau&rsquo;s maintenance crew members who work in the city&rsquo;s roadways every day on their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PBOTInfo"">Facebook</a> (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PBOTInfo"">https://www.facebook.com/PBOTInfo</a>) and <a href=""https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo"">Twitter</a> (<a href=""https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo"">https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo</a>) feeds. These hard working Portlanders are just feet away from fast moving traffic and potentially inattentive drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, crashes occur when people driving speed through a work zone, do not pay attention to changing road conditions, run into other vehicles or transportation equipment, or drive off the road completely. Given this, when driving in a work zone, the public is asked to please slow down, pay attention and stay calm. People walking or biking in a work zone should also observe barricades and road closed signage, use sidewalks if possible or other alternate routes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travelers should expect delays, plan for them and leave early to reach their destination on time. Remember, in roadway work zones, engineers and construction workers make safety their top priority every day&mdash;for the traveling public<strong> </strong>as well as themselves. Drivers should move into the correct lane well in advance and constantly be on the lookout for vehicles merging into adjacent travel lanes as they approach a work zone. People driving should double their following distance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day, workers from PBOT and other agencies are out in Portland streets doing their jobs, repairing streets, installing and fixing utilities and infrastructure. PBOT is proud to join with our fellow DOTs across the United States to bring attention to motorist and worker safety and mobility issues in work zones. Remember: paying attention saves lives.</p>

<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>(April 13, 2016) &nbsp;&ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation has recently obtained funding for a $2.8 million replacement of the 122nd Avenue Bridge, which spans Johnson Creek in East Portland.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">The bridge was damaged by heavy rains during winter storms and will remain closed to motor vehicles until a replacement bridge can be built, expected in 2019. The bridge sidewalk currently remains open for biking and walking.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">&ldquo;Public safety is our top priority and in this case to keep the public safe we need to limit access to the bridge until it can be replaced,&rdquo; Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;We understand a closure of this magnitude will be an inconvenience for the traveling public, and we will work to minimize the inconvenience in the coming weeks and during the construction period. We have made this decision after carefully considering the need for public safety. We&rsquo;re thankful for funding recently approved by the state.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">Since January, PBOT crews have worked to stabilize the bridge site to limit the risk of further deterioration. In March, a committee of the Oregon Department of Transportation and local agencies allocated $2.5 million in Federal Highway Bridge Funds for replacement of the 122nd Avenue Bridge. The federal funds require a local match of $300,000, which PBOT will provide using general transportation revenue, which is mainly funded by parking revenue and the City&rsquo;s share of state gas tax.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">Travelers in the area should use alternate routes to travel between SE Foster Road and SE Flavel Street.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">Local access will be maintained south of SE Foster Road and North of SE Flavel for residents and businesses.

Portland also leads the nation in active trips to school, with local K-8 school children an<img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=573820"" alt=""women on a bike"" width=""200"" height=""248"" />d their families embracing walking, biking and rolling to school 42 percent of the time. Despite these positive trends, the majority of Portland residents still choose single occupancy car trips as their primary mode of transportation.</p>
<p>Besides the diminished community health and safety concerns of a car-dependent society, Portland's growing population and increased road congestion threaten the region's economic vitality and livability if nothing is done to get more cars off roads. Most personal everyday trips are three miles or less and easily can be done by walking, bicycling and transit. This is where <a href=""/transportation/54616"">SmartTrips</a> comes in.</p>
<p>SmartTrips, or some form of individualized marketing program for active trips, has been delivered to Portlanders since 2003. For the last three years, SmartTrips has been reaching out to new movers, including people new to Portland and those who have changed neighborhoods. Moving is a great time to consider new ways to get around because with new environs, you are already forced to create new travel patterns.</p>
<p>Since 2014, SmartTrips has provided information to over 73,000 new mover households, and our bicycle delivery staff has delivered more than 8,000 personalized transportation packets to people's doorsteps. As a result, participants in our program report they are walking, biking and taking transit more than before. In fact, they are driving almost 12 percent less than prior to moving for both neighborhood trips and for getting to work. The primary goal of SmartTrips is to reduce drive alone trips while increasing active trips.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=573822"" alt=""smarttrips logo"" width=""200"" height=""75"" />The first SmartTrips order forms went out to new movers in March and we have already received over 1,000 orders for customized transportation packets filled with maps and information to help people make healthy new travel habits for getting around Portland. Beginning in May, SmartTrips&nbsp;will offer&nbsp;our great menu of <a href=""/transportation/41533"">Ten Toe Express walks</a>, and bike rides and classes offered through <a href=""/transportation/44099"">Portland By Cycle</a>.</p>

<p>After hours of excavation and repairs to damaged sewer lines, the Portland Bureau of Transportation plans to reopen the southbound lane of SE Milwaukie Avenue at SE Reedway Street by 4 p.m., in time for the evening commute. <br /> <br /> The northbound lane remains closed at SE Ramona Street. Travelers are encouraged to avoid the area between SE McLoughlin Boulevard and SE Bybee Boulevard. Northbound traffic is detoured to eastbound SE Yukon St to northbound SE 17th Avenue and west on SW Ellis Street to return to SE Milwaukie. <br /> <br /> Northbound is expected to be reopened later this evening. Look for updates at PBOT's Twitter account at <a href=""https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo"">https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo</a> <br /> <br /> The northbound lane will be closed again on Thursday from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for restoration of the underground utilities and investigation of more underground cavities. SE Milwaukie may be closed again Friday or next week for repaving of the road surface. <br /> <br /> IMAGES: For links to video and photos of the cavity and PBOT crews working to fix it, see PBTO's YouTube Channel at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/PBOTinfo"">https://www.youtube.com/user/PBOTinfo</a> and PBOT's Twitter feed at <a href=""https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo/media"">https://twitter.com/PBOTinfo/media</a> <br /> <br /> YouTube videos available: <br /> * <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8jJCg9GUj8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8jJCg9GUj8</a> <br /> <br /> * <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni79LY7PWEM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni79LY7PWEM</a> <br /> <br /> * <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GCZUNq1EZ8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GCZUNq1EZ8</a> <br /> <br /> * <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgV2-84cD70"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgV2-84cD70</a> <br /> <br /> Media availability: PBOT PIO is en route to speak with the media at SE Milwaukie Avenue and SE Reedway Street at 4:30 p.m. <br /> <br /> A cavity of about 2 feet in diameter was reported on Tuesday afternoon, believed to be about 4 feet by 6 feet underground as well. PBOT crews secured the area with a steel plate. Upon further inspection, crews found evidence of a larger underground cavity undermining the street surface and closed the road to gain better access at 8 a.m. today. <br /> <br /> Excavating through about 2 feet of material, including antiquated streetcar tracks, cobblestones and asfault, revealed an underground cavity about 6 feet deep, 12 feet wide and 17 feet long. Crews are investigating more underground cavities to the south of that area. <br /> <br /> The traveling public is advised to use alternate routes if possible, expect delays and use caution when traveling in the area. <br /> <br /> Underground cavities can be caused by sewer or water line leaks, damage caused by construction crews, the result of underground streams or weather events. Small cavities in city streets may be a sign of a larger underground problem. The public is advised to call PBOT's 24 hour dispatch to report sinkholes or other roadway hazards at 503-823-1700.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class=""content-left"">(April 20, 2016) -- The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that an inspection of a cavity in the roadway will require a full closure of SE Milwaukie Avenue at Reedway Street today at 8 a.m. <br /> <br /> Both northbound and southbound lanes will be closed at 8 a.m. There is no estimate for how long the closure will be required. <br /> <br /> The traveling public is advised to use alternate routes if possible, expect delays and use caution when traveling in the area. <br /> <br /> We will post an update as we learn more about the cause of the road damage and timing of the road closure. <br /> </p>

<p>(April 26, 2016)&nbsp; &ndash; <a href=""http://bit.ly/BetterNaito"">Better Naito</a> is returning to Portland for a second summer. The pilot project, a partnership between Better Block PDX and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, creates a safe way for people to get to and around Portland&rsquo;s summer of festivals at Waterfront Park. The project was first piloted in June 2015 during the two weeks of Rose Festival City Fair and returned for the Oregon Brewers Festival the same year.</p>
<p><strong>From May 2 to July 31, 2016, during all hours of the day, one northbound traffic lane from SW Main Street to NW Davis Street will be converted to a multi-use path for two-way walking and bicycling.</strong></p>
<p><strong>From July 1 to July 4 ONLY, the lane conversion will extend from SW Clay Street to NW Davis Street to accommodate people traveling to or around the Waterfront Blues Festival at the southern end of Waterfront Park.</strong></p>
<p>The festivals in Tom McCall Waterfront Park draw almost 700,000 people between April and November; roughly 15,000 more people per day during peak season. But to reach the festivals, people are too often forced to squeeze into narrow dirt paths, walk in a bike lane, or bike in a travel lane with motorized traffic. Better Naito 2015 created a safe space for people to travel to and from these events.</p>
<p>As a result of Better Naito 2015&rsquo;s success, the Portland Bureau of Transportation is granting Community Event Permits to the festivals and events taking place at and along Waterfront Park. The organizations will implement placemaking features along the Better Naito corridor and create a physically separated space for people walking and biking in order to help everyone safely and comfortably access the waterfront.</p>
<p>Data collected during the 2015 Better Naito found that during non-peak hours, motor vehicle travel times were not significantly affected. The travel time from the half mile stretch of SW Clay to SW Stark increased the most during AM and PM peak travel hours between 7:00-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM, with typical increases in motor vehicle travel times during peak hours between 45 seconds and one minute.

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmNK6upDzLY"">A video produced by Better Block PDX</a> about the 2015 Better Naito features interviews with community organizations, volunteers, City staff, and festival organizers about their successful work to transform one of Portland's most iconic streets.

<p>(April 27, 2016) &ndash; Portland Police wrote 36 citations and 8 warnings for traffic violations at a crosswalk education and enforcement action on SE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue on Tuesday, part of a joint effort by the Portland Police Bureau and Portland Bureau of Transportation to reach the Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Tuesday event are an effective way of educating the public about steps everyone can take to prevent crashes when driving, walking or biking.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=574831"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane. People walking should make sure oncoming traffic has adequate stopping distance and make sure vehicles have stopped before they enter a travel lane.</p>
<p>For Tuesday&rsquo;s event, a plain clothes Portland Police officer served as the designated pedestrian, crossing at the crosswalk while officers from the East Precinct and Traffic Division monitoring compliance and writing citations and warnings for violations of traffic safety laws. Signs warning of additional enforcement are placed beside the roadway in advance of the crosswalk.</p>
<p><strong>Results of the April 26 education and enforcement action include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Citations:</strong></p>
<p>Failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian-27</p>
<p>Seatbelt violations-2</p>
<p>Passing a stopped vehicle at a marked crosswalk-1</p>
<p>No Operators License-1</p>
<p>Driving While (License) Suspended-3</p>
<p>Expired registration-1</p>
<p>Failure to Carry Proof of Insurance-1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warnings:</strong></p>
<p>Failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian-8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failure to stop and remain stopped for a pedestrian (ORS 811.028) and passing a stopped vehicle at a marked crosswalk (ORS 811.020) are both Class B traffic violations, with a fine amount of $260. For certain violations, people are given the option of attending the Share the Road Safety Class in lieu of paying the citation.</p>
<p>Southeast 82nd Avenue is one of 10 High Crash Corridors that the transportation bureau has prioritized for stepped up education, enforcement and safety improvements.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

<p>(May 3, 2016)&nbsp; &ndash; Commissioner Steve Novick, Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat and representatives from Better Block PDX and seven festivals and events taking place at Tom McCall Waterfront Park this summer gathered at Salmon Street Springs this morning to inaugurate the 2016 Better Naito Pilot Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Better Naito Pilot Project, a partnership between Better Block PDX and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, creates a safe way for people to get to and around Portland&rsquo;s summer of festivals at Waterfront Park. The project was first piloted in June 2015 during the two weeks of Rose Festival City Fair and returned for the Oregon Brewers Festival the same year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s iteration of Better Naito, which will open one northbound motor vehicle lane to a two-way walking and biking facility nearly a mile long, is the largest temporary street transformation to take place in America in both its size and duration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data collected during the 2015 Better Naito found that during non-peak hours, motor vehicle travel times were not significantly affected. Morning and evening rush-hour motor vehicle traffic was delayed by less than a minute throughout the area. The&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/573249"">report</a>&nbsp;by Better Block PDX can be found on the Better Naito website: <a href=""http://www.betternaito.com/"">www.betternaito.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of Better Naito 2015&rsquo;s success, the Portland Bureau of Transportation is granting Community Event Permits to the festivals and events taking place at Waterfront Park. The organizations will implement placemaking features along the Better Naito corridor and create a physically separated space for people walking and biking in order to help everyone safely and comfortably access the waterfront.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safety is the highest priority behind every PBOT project. After a successful pilot period last year during the Portland Rose Festival, I am delighted that Better Naito will return for the safety of the thousands of people biking and walking to the waterfront this summer,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transportation Director Leah Treat said, &ldquo;Summer in Portland is all about people getting outside and taking to the streets to experience our city in creative and fun ways. Better Naito exemplifies that spirit and we are thrilled to have it for three months this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Naito is a living demonstration of how we can make Naito Parkway a better space for people,&rdquo; said Gwen Shaw, a Better Block PDX Volunteer, &ldquo;The design is temporary, but the concept is permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Rose Festival was the first organization to pilot Better Naito in 2015 and is returning again as a major supporter of the project. Rose Festival&rsquo;s CityFair serves 25,000 to 30,000 people daily and generates more than $100,000 per day in revenue. As part of its placemaking within the Better Naito space, the organization will be creating a &ldquo;living room experience&rdquo; every Saturday and Sunday of CityFair, offering entertainment and activities in the space, such as chalk painting for kids.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""The Better Naito Project offers the Rose Festival safer and more inviting options for visitors to enter the CityFair and RoZone events at Waterfront Park,"" said Jeff Curtis, Portland Rose Festival Foundation CEO. ""Pedestrian access along Naito will be much more protected and comfortable for families during all our opening hours.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A special edition of Better Naito will be added from July 1 to July 4 to accommodate people traveling to or around the Waterfront Blues Festival at the southern end of Waterfront Park. Owned and operated by Oregon Food Bank, the Waterfront Blues Festival is Oregon Food Banks&rsquo;s single largest fundraising event and the largest blues fest west of the Mississippi. Since 1988, the festival has raised over $10 million and 2 million pounds of food for individuals in Oregon and SW Washington.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Said Oregon Food Bank&rsquo;s CEO, Susannah Morgan, &ldquo;As the owner-operator of Waterfront Blues Festival, Oregon Food Bank supports this plan because it promotes public safety and enhances access to Portland&rsquo;s waterfront events for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s new bike share program, BIKETOWN, will also participate in Better Naito from July 8 to 25. The program will use space on Better Naito as an open-air office to showcase its smart bikes and for people to sign up for membership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well-designed, inviting infrastructure is a great complement to bike share systems,&rdquo; said Dorothy Mitchell, general manager of BIKETOWN. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to support Better Naito, which will make our waterfront a great place to walk and ride this summer. We&rsquo;ll be there offering a sneak preview of BIKETOWN and letting folks take our new orange bikes for a spin.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From May 2 to July 31, 24 hours a day, one northbound travel lane of SW Naito Parkway from SW Main Street to NW Davis Street (an almost 1-mile-long distance) will be opened for two-way walking and bicycling. Additionally, from July 1 to July 4 ONLY, the lane conversion will extend from SW Clay Street to NW Davis Street to accommodate people traveling to or around the Waterfront Blues Festival at the southern end of Waterfront Park. As part of the lane conversion and to make Naito Parkway safer for all users, the speed limit will be reduced to 20 mph for the length of the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The events and organizations participating in Better Naito 2016 are: Cinco de Mayo, Better Block PDX, the Portland Rose Festival, Portland Pride, the Waterfront Blues Festival, BIKETOWN Portland Bike Share and the Oregon Brewers Festival. Travel Portland, the Portland Police Bureau, Portland Fire &amp; Rescue and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation are also Better Naito partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summer events at Waterfront Park have become so popular that they draw, on average, 15,000 people a day to the waterfront. Better Naito follows in the historic footsteps of other Portland public space transformations in the same location. In 1974, Portland demolished the Harbor Drive expressway and replaced it with Waterfront Park - 36 acres of tree-filled public space voted one of America&rsquo;s ten greatest public spaces by the American Planning Association in 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All participating Better Naito organizations have obtained Community Event permits from PBOT which require them to implement placemaking features along the Better Naito corridor and to create a physically separated space for people walking and biking in order to help everyone safely and comfortably access the waterfront.</p>

<p>(May 6, 2016)&nbsp; &ndash; To mark National Bike Month, Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick and Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat joined Metro Councilor Bob Stacey, Multnomah County Commissioner Judy Shiprack and Multnomah County Library Director Vailey Oehlke at Holgate Library to celebrate &ldquo;Bike to Books&rdquo; - a new, bike-friendly collaboration between the Portland Bureau of Transportation and Multnomah County Library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration between the library and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, every child who bikes to any Multnomah County library branch will receive a free bike light provided by Metro (until supplies run out). In addition, PBOT will be offering free resources to families on safe biking with kids and maps of bike routes throughout the city. Libraries around the city are also offering special &ldquo;bike-themed&rdquo; story times for visitors as part of Bike Month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Books and bikes are two pillars of Portland culture. Multnomah County Library is the third-busiest public library in the United States, according to the Public Library Data Service, and has the hardest-working collection of library materials among large libraries in the U.S. In addition, Portland&rsquo;s young readers bike to school in record numbers. Today, thanks to the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School Program, 43.6 percent of trips to school in Portland are on foot or by bike &ndash; the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, PBOT is focusing its Bike Month efforts on getting families to bike more. Riding your bike to school or to the library can be simple, efficient and, most importantly, fun. Research has shown that biking to school has learning benefits for kids as well. A 2012 Danish study found that kids who biked or walked to school, rather than traveling by car or public transportation, performed measurably better on tasks demanding concentration, such as solving puzzles, and that the effects lasted for up to four hours after they got to school. Biking as a family is wonderful, healthy outdoor activity the entire family can enjoy together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about this collaboration between PBOT, Metro and Multnomah County Library to show kids how easy it can be to bike to the library and access the free resources and activities they offer throughout the years,&rdquo; said Portland Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so pleased to be joined here today by Commissioner Novick and Councilor Stacey, along with PBOT and the library,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Commissioner Judy Shiprack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Today, we&rsquo;re bringing together three public service organizations to help create and enhance safe, healthy and thriving communities. I am grateful to the City of Portland and Metro for their contributions to this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biking as a family lets you spend more quality time together, stay healthy and experience your community in a more personal way. Metro is dedicated to ensuring that families throughout the Portland region have safe, practical ways to ride bikes to the library, school, work or just for fun. We are excited to partner with the City of Portland and Multnomah County Libraries to increase safety for kids and parents riding bikes,"" said Metro Councilor Bob Stacey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As community hubs, libraries are all about connecting people with resources, knowledge and friendly personal assistance,&rdquo; said Director of Libraries Vailey Oehlke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to join our partners today at Holgate Library to kick off this new effort. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to riding my bike and invite everyone to take a spin to your local library and get one of these cool bike lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These regional partnerships that create incentives for people of all ages to give biking a try are essential as we work to build a bike system that accommodates riders from age eight to eighty,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Portland has been celebrating Bike Month since the 1970&rsquo;s and we are proud to be a bicycling leader. Showing our youngest riders how fun and easy biking can be will help us continue to grow our bike-friendly city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Bike Month runs throughout the month of May with events happening across the city sponsored by multiple organizations to encourage people of all ages to get on their bike and enjoy the spring sunshine and hundreds of miles of bike lanes and neighborhood greenways in the city of Portland.</p>

News,576137,"News Release: Mayor Hales, Commissioner Novick convene Vision Zero Executive Committee listening session to hear community concerns, committee briefing on latest Vision Zero initiatives",1,,2016-05-10 01:33:05 UTC,2016-05-10 01:29:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(May 9, 2016)&nbsp; &ndash; Portland Mayor Charlie Hales and Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick hosted a Vision Zero listening session at Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, a Level 1 Trauma Center, with the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Executive Committee this evening. Initial findings were shared of the Vision Zero Action Plan and public testimony was heard.</p>
<p>Vision Zero is the goal of ending all traffic fatalities and serious injuries. It acknowledges that the death or serious injury of even one person on Portland roadways is one too many. When answering the question, &ldquo;How many of our family members, friends, or neighbors can we accept being killed or maimed in traffic?&rdquo; the only acceptable answer is zero.</p>
<p>City of Portland staff and partners are in a year-long process to create a Vision Zero Action Plan. The plan will provide a detailed roadmap for how Portland will eliminate deaths and serious injuries from traffic crashes. The Vision Zero Executive Committee, comprised of elected officials and agency leaders, provides high-level leadership for Vision Zero efforts. The Vision Zero Task Force identifies actions specific to each agency, and develops the vision, goals and recommendations for the program. The Portland Bureau of Transportation and is leading the effort, which includes multiple City bureaus, agencies and community groups from across the region. PBOT expects to submit the plan to Portland City Council in October 2016.</p>
<p>Among the policy actions being considered by the Vision Zero Task Force: Utilizing marijuana or alcohol tax revenue to increase funding for the DUII Intensive Supervision Program (DISP), driver diversion and education programs; gaining local authority for the City of Portland to reduce the speed limit on Portland streets; and strengthening penalties for people who repeatedly drive in a dangerous manner.</p>
<p>Prior to the listening session, Mayor Hales, Commissioner Novick and Transportation Director Leah Treat toured Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, a Level I Trauma Center, which provides crucial medical services to people involved in crashes in the Portland area. The tour was led by Dr. Lori Morgan, Chief Administrative Officer of Legacy Emanuel Medical Center and Mike Morrison, B.S.N., a trauma nurse at Legacy Emanuel and a member of the Vision Zero Task Force.&nbsp;In 2014, the trauma service at Legacy Emanuel treated 2,586 trauma patients: 40 percent were involved in a motor vehicle or other motorized transport collision, 8 percent were struck by a vehicle and 4 percent were in bicycle crashes.</p>
<p>The cost of motor-vehicle crashes in Portland is astounding. The economic cost per crash of an incapacitating injury is $70,500, and for a non-incapacitating injury, $22,700, according to the National Safety Council. From 2003 to 2012 there were 2,488 incapacitating injury crashes in Portland, and 15,114 non-incapacitating injuries. These crashes resulted in a total cost of $175,404,000 and $343,087,800, respectfully. In addition to these striking figures, there were 318 deadly crashes totaling a cost of $451,560,000 during the same time frame. These costs include wage and productivity losses, medical expenses, administrative expenses, motor vehicle damage and employers&rsquo; uninsured costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day the women and men at this trauma center come to work and give life a fighting chance,&rdquo; Mayor Hales said. &ldquo;Every day, they rescue people from the brink of life-threatening injuries and give them hope. We need to do our part to help them by pursuing Vision Zero and doing everything in our power to reduce the risk of life-threatening injuries in our city. Last year, 37 people died in crashes on our streets. Many more were seriously injured. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Novick, who oversees PBOT, said, &ldquo;Today, we saw how traffic crashes make health care more expensive for everyone. Fatalities and serious injuries cause terrible pain for families and communities across Portland. Even if you&rsquo;re not involved in a crash, we all pay into a healthcare system that is burdened by the cost of treating these injuries. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important for us to do what we can do achieve Vision Zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legacy Emanuel is proud to participate in Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero efforts,&rdquo; Dr. Morgan said. &ldquo;Since 40 percent of our trauma patients are involved in traffic crashes, we know how crucial it is for the City and community partners to work together to reach Vision Zero. Every day, we see the injuries and suffering traffic crashes inflict on our community. As we make our streets safer, we will reduce the injuries we see here at the trauma center. We would like to thank Mayor Hales, Commissioner Novick and Director Treat for their leadership and commitment to reduce crashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hospital is a wonderful resource for the community, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if we didn&rsquo;t need to deal with life-threatening injuries from traffic crashes here?&rdquo; said Leah Treat, director of PBOT. &ldquo;Too many people come to this trauma center because of traffic violence. Over the last eight months, the Vision Zero Task Force has analyzed crash data and identified our most dangerous streets and intersections. They have also identified a set of potential policy actions we can take to increase the safety of our streets. As we move forward with other Vision Zero policy initiatives, we will continue to look to City Council and our elected representatives in Salem for their leadership on traffic safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other elected officials on the Vision&nbsp;Zero&nbsp;Executive Committee include state Sens. Michael Dembrow and Diane Rosenbaum and state Rep. Alissa Keny-Guyer and Metro Councilor Bob Stacey.</p>

Last summer, representatives for Legacy Health reached out to PBOT about making the crossing at N Vancouver and Graham safer.

Working together, PBOT and Legacy Health agreed to jointly fund the project.</p>

Since the installation and go live, I have made it a point to observe the various activity between motor vehicles, bicyclists and pedestrians and I have to say that this RFB seems to get the attention of all parties and a vast improvement over previous proposed solutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=577738"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Education and enforcement actions such as the May 27 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>This location was chosen at the request of the community, which has been active in educating and encouraging drivers to be alert, aware and slow down. The crossing is heavily used by school children and transit riders - a pre-school is on one corner and the crossing also supports two TriMet stops and is close to a public school bus pickup and drop off location on SW Miles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A Portland police officer will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during&nbsp;Friday&rsquo;s action.&nbsp;The exact time will be announced the day before the action.</p>
<p>PBOT encourages everyone who uses SW Capitol Highway to exercise care and caution when walking, biking and driving. People driving and people walking should remain alert and watch for people in the crossing and drivers who may be turning onto or from SW Miles Street.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=577739"" alt=""SW Capitol Highway and Miles"" width=""250"" height=""146.158854167"" />Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking.

<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.&nbsp; A Portland police officer served as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Friday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>PBOT encourages everyone who uses SW Capitol Highway to exercise care and caution when walking, biking and driving. People driving and people walking should remain alert and watch for people in the crossing and drivers who may be turning onto or from SW Miles Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

News,578465,Update: Portland Aerial Tram returns to normal operations earlier than expected after crews fix electrical problem,1,,2016-06-01 22:39:54 UTC,2016-05-31 05:39:00 UTC,A,,"<div class=""NewsStory content-left"">(3:35 pm June 1, 2016) The Portland Aerial Tram is back to normal operations earlier than expected, after crews were able to replace a part and fix an electrical problem. Travel time between the lower and upper terminals is back to the normal 4 minutes. </div>
<div class=""NewsStory content-left""><em>---------------------&nbsp;</em></div>
<div id=""news94851"" class=""NewsStory content-left""><em></em>(May 30, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public to expect delays, especially during morning and evening commutes, when using the Portland Aerial Tram to access OHSU's Marquam Hill campus on Tuesday and Wednesday. <br /> <br />On May 31 and June 1, the tram will operate on diesel power due to an electrical issue. On diesel power, the tram can only operate at about half of normal speed. Travel time between the lower and upper terminals will be 8 minutes instead of the normal 4 minutes. Delays during morning and evening rush hour could be as long as 20 minutes. <br /> <br />To avoid delays at the tram, riders can transfer from TriMet, or Portland Streetcar in downtown Portland to the TriMet number 8-Jackson Park/NE 15th bus line for access to Marquam Hill. <br /> <br />Riders may have to wait for multiple cabins during peak times because of the slower travel speed and long lines. Operations staff will be at the lower terminal in the morning in order to communicate information about the delays. <br /> <br />Tram cabins will be completely full, so please expect crowded conditions. <br /> <br />Hours of operation will be normal, 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. <br /> <br />Normal operations are expected to resume on Thursday, after a part is received on Wednesday and installed on Wednesday night.</div>

Because the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Union Pacific Railroad are also making mechanical and electrical repairs to the structure, the lower deck will be held in the raised position, closed to bike and pedestrian access, for up to four to six hours each day.</span></p>
<p>Since the lower deck of the Steel Bridge was opened in 2001, it has become a popular route for people bike and walking. The deck will be closed from 2 to 6 p.m. on Wednesday June 8 and Thursday June 9. If ships are able to pass before 6 p.m., the deck will be lowered and access restored as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The lower deck will be raised again on Monday June 13, from 5 a.m. to 12 p.m. If ships are able to pass before noon, the deck will be lowered and access restored as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Public access to the upper deck will be maintained, but expect intermittent bridge closures from 2 to 6 p.m. on Wednesday and Thursday and on Monday morning as ships arrive and depart.</p>
<p>The Broadway, Burnside, and Steel drawbridges will need to open for ship arrivals and departures. Travelers can avoid delays by choosing a fixed span bridge or a bridge south of the Burnside Bridge. For bridge information, visit www.multco.us/bridges. For event information, visit www.rosefestival.org.</p>
<p>For information on impacts to TriMet bus service, check trimet.org/alerts.</p>

<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;With today&rsquo;s announcement, we are taking another giant step toward making BIKETOWN a reality,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;When we launch on&nbsp;July 19th, we&rsquo;re going to have one of the best bike share systems&nbsp;in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">PBOT and its partners also unveiled a map of the first 100 BIKETOWN station locations. The map is&nbsp;available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwNjE0LjYwMjU3MDMxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDYxNC42MDI1NzAzMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDQ3NDIzJmVtYWlsaWQ9cGJvdGNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZ1c2VyaWQ9cGJvdGNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;http://biketownpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWNPDX.com</a>. The stations will house 1,000 ""smart bikes"" with the latest technology. Customers will be able to check out a bike using a smartphone, a computer, a member card, or by typing in their member number and PIN into the keypad on the bike. Bikes can also be parked at thousands of publicly-accessible bike racks in the service area. Users who park a bike outside of a station will be charged an additional fee, and users who return such bikes to the stations will receive a credit. Every bike&rsquo;s exact location can be viewed in real-time from the system&rsquo;s website or smartphone app. The app will be available shortly before the program launches.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">BIKETOWN stations were selected with extensive public involvement. An online portal received more than 4,500 comments, and staff led more than&nbsp;40 meetings with community groups, local businesses and five public workshops.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;This station map gives Portlanders 100 more reasons to be excited about BIKETOWN,&rdquo; Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;I want to thank the thousands of Portlanders who took the time to give us their input on station locations. July 19th&nbsp;can&rsquo;t come soon enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Annual memberships for BIKETOWN will cost $12 per month, and include 90 minutes of riding time each day. Single-ride passes and 24-hour passes will also be available when the system launches for those who want to use the program more occasionally, including tourists.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Nike designed the innovative visual identity for BIKETOWN's standard bike, which is modeled after the Nike orange shoe box. BIKETOWN will also launch with three unique, limited-edition bike wrap designs &ndash; inspired by iconic Nike sneakers &ndash; across 100 of the system&rsquo;s 1,000 bikes. More details will be revealed prior to the July 19 launch.&nbsp;</p>

News,581323,News Release: Installation of new parking meters begins in the Central Eastside Industrial District,1,,2016-06-21 17:36:50 UTC,2016-06-21 17:34:00 UTC,A,,"<p dir=""ltr"">(June 21, 2016) &nbsp;&ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced today that it will begin installing 29 parking meters along selected streets in the Central Eastside Industrial District (CEID), including along E. Burnside, NE Grand, NE MLK and SE 6th Avenue (see map below). The bureau will also upgrade 13 older meters with the latest model. With this installation, PBOT takes a significant step toward implementing the next phase of the Central Eastside Parking Management Plan. Adopted by City Council in June 2012, the Management Parking Plan was the result of a collaborative planning process between PBOT, business owners and neighborhood representatives.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Central Eastside is already seeing an increase in density as a result of ongoing residential and commercial development in the area. As a result, the Central Eastside Industrial District continues to work with PBOT to manage the increasing demand for limited on-street parking. The new parking meters will serve as an important tool in helping PBOT, in partnership with community stakeholders, work to meet this goal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;Given the extensive development taking place in the central city, it remains incumbent upon PBOT to continue to work to balance the demand for on-street parking in order to support area businesses and future housing demand,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Parking meters will help support rapidly growing businesses, their customers and other visitors to the area.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;Both the existing as well as the new meters to be installed will be located in and around the Grand/King commercial corridor of the CEID,&rdquo; Said Michael Bolliger of Bolliger &amp; Sons Insurance and a member of <a href=""http://ceic.cc/"">Central Eastside Industrial Council's (CEIC)</a> Transportation and Parking Advisory Committee's (TPAC) subcommittee. &ldquo;In this area we are working hard to achieve a balance between employee parking and customer parking for the district&rsquo;s service and retail businesses. We hope these meters will provide a similar solution as they have in other parts of the Central city with high parking demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-4c180b01-7407-dd24-d261-9fcd4675b3dd"">The parking meters being installed in the Central Eastside are the same model installed in NW Portland earlier this year. &nbsp;The meters in NW Portland have performed very well, processing tens of thousands of transactions a month with extremely low rates of customer service difficulties.</span></p>

With an online survey launched today, people with disabilities can tell the City about their experiences using taxis or Transportation Network Companies such as Uber and Lyft.</p>
<p>Take the survey now at&nbsp;<a href=""/TRANSPORTATION/pdxrides"">portlandoregon.gov/transportation/pdxrides</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transportation access for people with disabilities is a top priority for the private for hire program, and we need your help to make improvements,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;Please take a few minutes right now to complete the survey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PBOT and the committee will use input from the survey to improve service for people with disabilities. While the City requires taxis and TNCs to serve everyone, there is limited information available on current wheelchair-accessible vehicle use and the potential demand for the service. There is also very limited information on transportation service needs for people with other types of disabilities, such as limited hearing or vision.</p>
<p>PBOT seeks to ensure that people with disabilities have access to taxis and TNCs as equivalent as possible to service provided to people without disabilities. Learn more about private for hire transportation at&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/pdxrides"">portlandoregon.gov/transportation/pdxrides</a>.</p>
<p>The survey will be available online for three weeks. The web site does not allow users to take it multiple times.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The 103-mile total for fiscal year 2015-16 is more than double the mileage preserved three years ago. At the direction of the Portland City Council, PBOT in July 2013 revised its pavement maintenance program. Called Back to Basics, the new program set an annual goal of maintaining at least 100 miles of streets through a variety of treatments.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Three years ago, we committed to doing preventative maintenance on 100 lane miles of city street per year,&rdquo; said Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;Thanks to the hard work of our crews and engineers, we have exceeded our goal for a third year in a row. Next year with the revenue from Measure 26-173, the voter-approved fuels tax, we&rsquo;ll be able to do even more to improve the condition and safety of our roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This is our third year delivering on our commitment of preserving and maintaining 100 miles of Portland roads,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;We continue to prioritize our limited transportation revenue to meet this goal because we know spending a dollar today saves us ten dollars in future years. We continue to pilot new treatments like crack sealant, which we applied this past year on our arterial streets and found it to be very effective. I want to thank our maintenance crews and our engineers who work together to identify and prioritize the streets that are the best candidates for preventative maintenance and then do the critical work to extend the operating life of our streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""gd_p""><em>PBOT crews grind down SW Chestnut Street in preparation for repaving. Photo by Hannah Schafer, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The announcement was made at SW Chestnut Street and 10th Avenue, where PBOT crews were grinding the asphalt in preparation for repaving in the coming days. SW Chestnut Street serves as a key route for people walking, biking and driving to Wilson High School, Rieke Elementary School and the bustling Hillsdale Town Center. PBOT prioritizes Back to Basics maintenance on streets near schools, as well as major routes that serve biking, walking or freight.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT also&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/582337?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">published a map</a>&nbsp;showing the citywide locations where streets have been maintained in recent years and where the bureau plans to conduct street maintenance in the fiscal year that starts Friday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>About Back to Basics:</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT&rsquo;s pavement maintenance policy is to carry out the right treatment in the right place at the right time. In practice, this means that bureau crews focus on maintenance work that will keep a street from falling into poor or very poor condition. The reason is simple: it saves Portland money. The cost of repairing a road that has fallen into poor or very poor condition is typically ten times more expensive than maintaining a street that is in fair or good condition.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Arterials and collectors, with their frequent and heavy loads, experience harsher wear and tear. This deterioration often reaches below the road surface and affects the street&rsquo;s base structure. &nbsp;The weight of a standard passenger bus, for example, has as much impact on the pavement as ten thousand automobile trips. Correcting damage to the base structure of the road is more complicated and expensive than addressing surface-level problems like cracks and worn asphalt. Neighborhood streets, on the other hand, experience far less traffic and often can be maintained and repaired with less costly methods.</p>
<h3>Pavement Maintenance Treatments:</h3>
<p><em>Fog and Crack Sealing:</em></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This treatment is performed on residential streets in generally good condition. First, crews seal the visible cracks on the streets. They will follow this up with a fog seal that seals the road surface from the effects of water and the sun. Fog seal is a liquid petroleum product consisting of water, asphalt, recycled tires and grit and is sprayed on clean pavement and allowed to dry. It protects the roadway from weatherization for an estimated 3-5 years. It costs $10,000 to $12,500 per mile.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><em>Grind and Pave:</em></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This treatment is used for high-traffic streets which are typically in fair condition with little or no evidence of failure in the road base. The top two inches are asphalt are ground down, recycled and the road is repaved. This treatment typically costs $150,000 per mile.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><em>Base repair:</em></p>
<p>This treatment is reserved for streets that are in poor or very poor condition. The work is limited to small areas within a street that is falling apart and/or a potential hazard to road users. Both the rock base and the asphalt street surface are removed and completely replaced. Base repair is very expensive and typically costs $500,000 per mile. Although this type of repair is expensive and only limited to small areas of a failing street, it allows PBOT to address urgent safety needs and improve the street&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Street maintenance is heavily weather dependent. Though crews work year round, the most productive months are from June to September.</p>

<p class=""gdp"">The Hawthorne Bridge will remain open to all users. Motor vehicle traffic heading northbound on SW Naito Parkway to the Hawthorne Bridge will be detoured to the Hawthorne Bridge onramp on SW Madison Street. The detour will take northbound motor vehicle traffic west on SW Clay to northbound on SW 2nd Avenue to eastbound on SW Madison Street, leading to the Hawthorne Bridge.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Waterfront Blues Festival is expected to draw 100,000 people between July 1 and 4; roughly 25,000 people per day. The lane conversion and onramp closure is intended to create a safe way for people to get to and around Waterfront Park and will connect with the existing Better Naito configuration that people have become accustomed to.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Better Naito is nearly a mile of street, 15 feet wide, open for two-way bicycling, walking and general public use from SW Main Street to NW Davis Street. From July 1 to 4, the conversion will extend an additional quarter-mile south beginning at SW Clay Street and stretching to NW Davis Street for the Waterfront Blues Festival.<br /> <br /> In 2015, Better Naito, a partnership between Portland Bureau of Transportation and Better Block PDX, began efforts to create a safe way for people to travel during Portland's peak festival season. Prior to Better Naito, people were often forced to squeeze into narrow dirt paths, walk in a bike lane, or bike in a travel lane with high-speed traffic. As a result of the program's success in 2015, an extended pilot was planned for the 2016 summer season. <br /> <br /> The 29th annual Safeway Waterfront Blues Festival is presented by First Tech Federal Credit Union. Ticket and artist information for the festival can be found at <a href=""http://www.waterfrontbluesfest.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.waterfrontbluesfest.com</a>. A limited number of passes for Oregon Trail Card holders will be available each day at the Hawthorne Gate.<br /> <br /> For additional information about Better Naito, please visit the project website at <a href=""http://www.betternaito.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.betternaito.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">Sandy Boulevard is one of Portland&rsquo;s 10 designated high crash corridors.&nbsp; This location has bus stops on both sides of the street and is within close proximity to businesses, restaurants, a senior living facility and The Grotto, a prominent destination for 300,000 visitors annually.<img class=""govd_template_image content-right"" src=""http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/06/924019/953654/visionzerologo_crop.png"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""93"" height=""93"" />Education and enforcement actions such as the July 6 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.&nbsp;Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.&nbsp; A Portland police officer served as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT encourages everyone who uses NE Sandy Boulevard to exercise care and caution when walking, biking and driving. People driving and people walking should remain alert and people driving should watch for people in the crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

Every bike&rsquo;s exact location can be viewed in real-time from the system&rsquo;s website or the BIKETOWN smartphone app.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The BIKETOWN app can also be used to purchase memberships, reserve bikes for up to 10 minutes in advance of a ride, and view account history and trip maps. The app is now available for download at <a href=""/transportation/www.BIKETOWNPDX.com/app"">BIKETOWNPDX.com/app</a> or directly through the App Store or Google Play.</p>

<p>Last week our <a href=""/transportation/68009"">Safe Routes to School</a> team set out to spend a week on two wheels with kids from <a href=""http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/jamesjohn/206.htm"">James John SUN School</a> during our Bike Camp, and it was a total success! We taught 3-5 graders bike safety, developed leadership skills, kept kids active, and made connections with nature and their neighborhood.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=584903"" alt=""Bike Camp 2016"" width=""350"" height=""228.915662651"" />Bike Camp is offered to specific schools in the Portland area every summer through PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Routes to Schools Program. The goal of the program is to teach students bike safety and build confidence navigating their neighborhood streets.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, campers set an ambitious goal to ride 50 miles which they exceeded &ndash; totaling 55 miles. They looped around most parks in North Portland, and rode over as many pedestrian bridges as they could find. Every morning campers would choose their destination using bike maps. It was easy to find safe routes that accommodated all skill levels thanks to the <a href=""/transportation/50518"">Neighborhood Greenway</a> system.</p>
<p>As an instructor, it was fun to see how the campers grew daily in their confidence. Parker, a 5<sup>th</sup> grader, got in the habit of verbalizing all of the steps he would take at intersections, that way he could prove to his instructors he did not need any help.</p>

<p>With increased confidence came their ability to ride further distances. They created more complex routes taking us as far south as Dawson Park! But all routes had something in common - kids always wanted to stop by the <a href=""http://www.communitycyclingcenter.org/community/partner-programs/new-columbia/"">Bike Repair Hub in New Columbia</a> to practice on the skills park to master a new section of the course.</p>

Though we had a really strong group of riders who tried to spend as much time on their bikes as possible; being at the park and taking in nature was exactly what we all needed to recharge batteries and keep on riding.</p>

News,585556,News Release: Bilingual survey seeks public feedback on transportation in Portland’s Central City,1,,2016-08-02 22:31:02 UTC,2016-08-02 20:36:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(August 2, 2016) - The City of Portland Bureau of Transportation launched its&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71158?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Central City Multimodal Project</a>&nbsp;today with the publication of an Early Input Survey. The survey, offered in both&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/CentralCityMP?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">English</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://es.surveymonkey.com/r/ProyectoCCM?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Spanish</a>, asks people about how they travel, where they go, and what challenges they face while getting around in the Central City. It is the first step of a year-long public involvement process that will inform decision making on the multimodal infrastructure added to the area. The Central City Multimodal Project will help make getting to and around the Central City safer, easier, and more convenient. PBOT will ask City Council to formally accept federal grant funds dedicated to the project on August 31.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland&rsquo;s Central City is the center of the metropolitan region, with Oregon&rsquo;s densest concentration of people and jobs. Currently about 23,000 people reside and 123,000 people work in the Central City&rsquo;s five square miles, an area that represents only three percent of Portland&rsquo;s total size. By 2035, 30 percent of Portland&rsquo;s population growth is expected to occur in the Central City. This growth equates to an additional 37,000 new households and 51,000 new jobs.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">Survey participants will have an opportunity to enter a raffle prize for their choice of $100 of SmartPark vouchers, an annual BIKETOWN bike share membership, or a one-month TriMet pass at the end of the survey. Survey results as well as other public involvement opportunities that will take place in the coming year will inform a prioritized project list to be constructed with federal grant money and Fixing Our Streets funds. Construction on projects is projected to begin in 2018.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""As our our Central City grows and changes we must ensure that the needs of all people living and working in the area are taken into account,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;The Central City encompasses a wide swath of communities, workplaces and levels of income and we want to make sure everyone is included from day one. This survey marks the beginning of that conversation.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Portland&rsquo;s Central City is where 350+ Airbnb employees come every day to work toward our mission of creating a community where you can &lsquo;Belong Anywhere.&rsquo; We love our location in the heart of Old Town, which allows us to recruit top talent who want the ability to walk, bike, or take public transit to work,"" said Darin Evenson, Airbnb's Director of Customer Experience for North America and the Portland site lead. ""We look forward to the different types of infrastructure improvements in the Central City that will help our employees, hosts, and the thousands of Airbnb guests who visit Portland every year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;In addition to being Oregon&rsquo;s largest public university, PSU is a top destination in Portland&rsquo;s Central City. We have 29,000 students and 4,000 employees, and approximately 1 million visitors every year,&rdquo; said Ian Stude, Director of Transportation and Parking for Portland State University. &ldquo;My job is to ensure all these people can safely and efficiently access all that PSU has to offer. At PSU, we think investing in efficient multimodal infrastructure is the best way forward for Portland&rsquo;s Central City and we look forward to partnering on this project.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""gdp"">(Aug. 9, 2016) - Commissioner Steve Novick, Transportation Director Leah Treat and representatives from Old Town Chinatown and the Ankeny Alley associations cut the ribbon today on Portland&rsquo;s newest public space: Ankeny Plaza.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The project is the latest in a series of programs and projects by the Portland Bureau of Transportation celebrating &ldquo;Portland in the Streets.&rdquo; &nbsp;As part of the celebration, PBOT released an <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwODA5LjYyNDUyMTYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDgwOS42MjQ1MjE2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDY2MDQ3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;103&amp;&amp;&amp;http://arcg.is/20Cv1HJ?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">interactive map</a> highlighting the numerous resources, events and activities Portlanders can use, visit, lead or join that take place in the public right-of-way, including Ankeny Plaza, BIKETOWN, block parties, street fairs and Portland Sunday Parkways.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Ankeny Plaza, Portland&rsquo;s latest example of innovation in the public right-of-way, covers 20,000 square feet -- the equivalent of half a downtown city block -- on SW Third Avenue. Located in front of Voodoo Doughnut, just east of the Keep Portland Weird Mural and just west of Portland Saturday Market, Ankeny Plaza creates a welcoming public space at a key destination for tourists and locals alike.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The idea first came to PBOT&rsquo;s attention when Better Block PDX and businesses in Old Town Chinatown held a three-day, public space demonstration project in October 2014. The event&rsquo;s success led to further collaboration between PBOT and the local neighborhood and business associations.</p>

The <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwODA5LjYyNDUyMTYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDgwOS42MjQ1MjE2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDY2MDQ3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;105&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/579719?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Second Avenue Reconfiguration Project</a> began last weekend and is nearing completion.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">To create Ankeny Plaza, angled parking on SW 3rd Avenue between W Burnside and SW Ankeny was removed and new parking spaces were installed approximately 29 feet west of the curb running parallel to the street. Adjacent to the parking spots are new, self-watering planters as additional protection and greenery for the cafe seating in the new public space.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Ankeny Alley Association will manage the day-to-day maintenance of the new Plaza as part of their agreement with PBOT. Businesses using the cafe seating in the space have sidewalk use permits. A <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwODA5LjYyNDUyMTYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDgwOS42MjQ1MjE2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDY2MDQ3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;106&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.biketownpdx.com?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN</a> station and kiosk were also installed in the new plaza.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The total cost of the Ankeny Plaza project is $20,000 from PBOT&rsquo;s Community Permitting Program. The Portland Development Commission also awarded a $82,000 PDC Community Livability Grant to the Ankeny Alley Association for the project. This additional money has not yet been allocated. PBOT and the Ankeny Alley Association are exploring long-term improvements and strategies to best use this additional funding.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Back in May, City Council proclaimed the summer of 2016 to be Portland in the Streets season. We made that proclamation because we wanted to highlight what a valuable resource our streets are not just for getting around, but for beloved community events like Sunday Parkways, block parties, street fairs, farmers&rsquo; markets and now, Ankeny Plaza,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;Our streets are our largest public space and here in Portland we are very good at using them to celebrate community, to foster our neighborhood businesses and, of course, to have a lot of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;In Portland, streets are the most abundant type of public space, occupying nearly 20 percent of land area in our city,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;This plaza is setting an example for the rest of the city as we embark on our Livable Streets Strategy that will support new innovation in the public right-of-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Said James Silviano, President of the Ankeny Alley Association, &ldquo;When the city of Portland, and Portland Development Commission step up and make these kinds of improvements, we feel it. &nbsp;All of us feel like we stand together, and the city is behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;In 2013, the Old Town/Chinatown Community Association, in partnership with the PDC&rsquo;s 5-year Action Plan, embarked on a journey in making the neighborhood one of the best in Portland,&rdquo; said Helen Ying, Board President of the Old Town China Community Association. &ldquo;One of the perceived obstacles that bubbled up was that the traffic patterns and Burnside Boulevard had divided the north side of the neighborhood from the south side. With the pedestrian improvements along SW Second and Third avenues making it easier for people to explore the neighborhood, we have created a bridge for that divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;The north/south protected bike route on 2nd and 3rd allows a safer connection for bicyclists,&rdquo; said Dan Lenzen, Old Town Chinatown Community Association Business Committee Chair. &ldquo;Every intersection in Old Town now has a designated crosswalk. The PBOT street realignment has given us safer auto speeds. Pedestrians can now walk, shop and dine throughout our neighborhood safer. All this has been done with a 0 net effect to district parking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Better Block PDX is proud to see PBOT implement these public space improvements that were initially proposed by the neighbors and businesses in the Old Town Chinatown Community Association,&rdquo; said Better Block PDX Volunteer Ryan Hashagen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see how one weekend of people sitting on hay bales and playing ping pong in the street can spark a larger community conversation and imagination!&rdquo;</p>

The left lane northbound and the left lane southbound were closed after 11 p.m. Tuesday night and were closed all day today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> Two travel lanes remain open, one each direction, though all traffic has been diverted to the eastern half of the roadway. <br /> <br /> An 8-inch terra-cotta sewer pipe believed to be built in the year 1900 was found to have been broken, causing water to erode the surrounding soil, undermining the road surface. A concrete plug from an old connection to a nearby home may have failed, contributing to the damage. A video by PBOT crews shows standing water inside the sewer pipe, indicating a sunken section of pipe that also caused some erosion in the area or may have been caused by erosion from a nearby break. The exact cause of the breaks in the sewer main that led to the erosion has not been determined. <br /> <br /> PBOT crews found an underground cavity approximately 8 feet wide, 8 feet long and as much as 8 feet tall in some areas under the road surface. <br /> <br /> PBOT has posted HD video of standing water in a sunken section of the pipe. <br /> <br /> Video courtesy Portland Bureau of Transportation: <a href=""https://youtu.be/gYG5QtJIQJ4"">https://youtu.be/gYG5QtJIQJ4</a> <br /> <br /> Pictures by Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Showing people the secret streets hidden from most city maps that hold that Sunday Parkways-like experience is what Open Streets does for Portland,&rdquo; said PBOT&rsquo;s Active Transportation and Safety Programs Manager, Linda Ginenthal. &ldquo;It is not enough to have 20,000 people out riding on a Sunday afternoon. It is our obligation to get back to a place where kids and families can open their doors and stream out into the longest public space we have &ndash; our streets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>By Amber Shackelford, Portland Bureau of Transportation</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">(August 19, 2016) - Portland&rsquo;s next bridge won&rsquo;t be built over water, but instead over I-405.&nbsp;Today it was announced that the <a href=""/transportation/71475"">Flanders Crossing bridge</a> has been funded by the Oregon Transportation Commission and that construction could begin as soon as April 2018. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is providing $3 million of the $5.9 million cost; $2,877,000 is coming from the state&rsquo;s <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwODE5LjYyODA0NjExJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDgxOS42MjgwNDYxMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDY5MDIwJmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;103&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/Pages/connector.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery""><em>Connect</em>Oregon</a> program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=587467"" alt=""Flanders Crossing Rendering"" width=""670"" height=""578.66805411"" /></p>
<p>The bridge&rsquo;s design was chosen after a thorough evaluation process that examined the best options in regards to equity, environmental concerns, and economic prosperity. The bridge, designed to be about 250 feet long and 24 feet wide, will be for pedestrians and people on bikes, with no lanes for car traffic or transit. On each side of the bridge will be a 6 foot sidewalk for pedestrians, and on the inside will be two 6 foot lanes for bicycles. This separation of uses eliminates any conflicts between bicycles and pedestrians. Also included in the project are new crossings at NW 15th and 16th to help people get onto and off of the bridge.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Strong support for Flanders Crossing was shared throughout the adjacent neighborhood and the business communities, including the Pearl District Neighborhood Association, Northwest District Neighborhood Association, Pearl District Business Association, the Pacific Northwest College of Art and more. This support shows that people are beginning to understand the value of biking and walking. Not only are they healthier and more sustainable alternatives to driving, but they can also assist in building the economy and community. With all of these factors, it&rsquo;s clear that Flanders Crossing will be an important and worthwhile addition to Portland&rsquo;s transportation network.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=587470"" alt=""flanders crossing map"" width=""300"" height=""225.436893204"" />Right now, there are no crossings like this over I-405. All other options for people on foot or bike essentially require crossing freeway onramps. These routes are often congested and do not provide sufficient space for those using active transportation. The <a href=""/transportation/71475"">Flanders Crossing</a> will provide a safer alternative and will open up the option of walking and biking to people who don&rsquo;t feel comfortable crossing the freeway at other locations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The predicted numbers for how many people will use Flanders Crossing are huge. Including the potential neighborhood greenway, there could be an estimated 9,100 daily trips across Flanders Crossing. Although this number combines walking and biking trips, it is still around five times the amount of bike rides taken across the Tilikum Crossing each day.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">How could this comparatively smaller bridge generate so much usage? The key is in the location. Over the past couple years, more and more housing has been built in the Pearl District, and more jobs have been cropping up in the Northwest District. The ability to live and work in a thriving downtown area where active modes of transportation are all you need to get around is drawing top talent. This draw in turn attracts businesses that want those talented individuals working with them. This dynamic is what has businesses such as Airbnb and Vestas supporting the Flanders Crossing project. The bridge will provide a crucial link for people living and working in different parts of NW Portland. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The bridge is not the only plan the City has to improve active travel in this area. The overall plan is to build a neighborhood greenway on Flanders stretching from NW 24th to the Steel Bridge, with Flanders Crossing being part of that. This greenway would create a low-stress east-west path through the city. Although the funds received only cover the project and not the improvements necessary to implement a neighborhood greenway the City is committed to the entire project and is actively seeking ways to make it happen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And, if all of these reasons aren&rsquo;t enough, Flanders Crossing could also serve a critical role in the event of an earthquake. Since it would be built to modern seismic standards, the bridge would be designed to be resilient to a 9.0 quake - meaning it may be the only route left standing to cross I-405 were such an earthquake to occur. This resilience will allow people on foot and on bike, as well as emergency vehicles, to cross over this divide.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From the safe passage it will provide, to the opportunities it will open up, and the economy it will help promote, PBOT is very excited to be making <a href=""/transportation/71475"">Flanders Crossing</a> a reality.</p>

News,587892,News Release: Oregon’s first Speed Safety Cameras now operational on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway,1,,2016-08-25 19:44:29 UTC,2016-08-25 19:39:00 UTC,A,,"<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3; background-color: #ffffff;"">(Aug. 25, 2016) -- The first Speed Safety Cameras in Oregon are now operational on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, and will begin issuing warnings today to drivers who exceed the road&rsquo;s posted 40 mph speed limit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=587893"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />The goal of the Speed Safety Cameras is to reduce speeding and save lives. The SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway corridor is part of Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Network of roads. PBOT&rsquo;s recent Vision Zero crash data analysis found that Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway is one of the top roads where people driving are killed or seriously injured. People walking along or crossing on foot are twice as likely to be struck by a car than on the average city street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;No family should lose a loved one to reckless speeding,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;The connection between death and high speeds is clear. Unfortunately, too many people continue to disregard the fact that safe speeds save lives. That&rsquo;s why the implementation of these new Speed Safety Cameras is so important - they are a proven tool for reducing speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Speed Safety Cameras are a critical tool for addressing unsafe driving speeds on Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Corridors,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat, &ldquo;We have an imperative to address the high rate of fatalities happening along these roads and to keep Portlanders safe - whether they are walking, bicycling or driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/08/986110/1010313/cameras-posted-on-bh-hwy_crop.jpg"" alt=""Safety Cameras on BH Hwy"" width=""590"" height=""443"" /></p>
<div><span class=""gd_p"">Photo by Hannah Schafer, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">The installation on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway is the first safety camera installation since the City of Portland and community safety advocates convinced the state Legislature in 2015 to pass HB 2621, which allows them to be used on High Crash Corridors in the Portland city limits. The City of Portland has been using other cameras to supplement speed enforcement for years, with police officers in vans enforcing speed limit violations. Portland also uses cameras to increase enforcement compliance with red lights at traffic signals.</span></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Safety Cameras are a proven safety tool that can reduce dangerous speeding and save lives. The cameras are mounted along High Crash Corridors and when people driving past them exceed the posted speed limit, they capture photos and video for review by Portland Police. The Speed Safety Cameras will issue warnings for the first 30 days of operation, and issue citations starting Sept. 24. An officer from the Portland Police Bureau will review violations before a citation is issued. The typical fine will be $160. Any money received from the tickets pays for the program and safety improvements on the corridor. Additional cameras will be installed during winter and spring 2017 at SE 122nd Avenue between Foster and Powell Boulevards, Marine Drive and Outer SE Division Street.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to the new cameras, PBOT is delivering three additional safety and maintenance projects on a section of SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway beginning this fall that reflect the goals of the Southwest Community Plan and the Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway High Crash Corridor Safety Plan.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Among the included projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paving maintenance:&nbsp;PBOT will perform a two-inch grind and pave maintenance project, resulting in new pavement from SW 21st/Bertha Court to SW 35th&nbsp;Avenue to be delivered this fall 2016.</li>
<li>Safety Demonstration Project:&nbsp;PBOT will deliver a Safety Demonstration Project on Beaverton Hillsdale Highway in spring 2017. The project includes a new marked pedestrian crossing with a median island with Rapid Flashing Beacons at 35th Avenue, a protected pedestrian/bike lane space, reduced travel lane widths, and new ADA-compliant pedestrian curb ramps.</li>
<li>Stormwater Improvements:&nbsp;PBOT and the Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) are partnering to install stormwater curb extensions on at Shattuck. These will shorten the pedestrian crossings and ADA curb ramps will be constructed at all corners. Construction will be completed in the 2016/2017 fiscal year.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""gd_p"">New speed signage and speed reader boards were also installed on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway warning drivers in advance of the cameras in both directions. Additionally, PBOT staff conducted extensive outreach with local neighborhood associations as well as over 75 businesses and community organizations to raise awareness of the changes along the corridor.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The goals of this partnership are to provide a positive and safe environment for our children to learn and travel to and from school and to provide a safe environment in and around the schools for students, parents, school staff and their neighbors for the start of the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Beginning this week, many young people will be walking and riding their bicycles to school. Congestion in school zones will increase, especially during the busy morning and afternoon drop-off and pickup times. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As students head back to school, it&rsquo;s particularly important to obey traffic laws and drive safely in school zones. Drivers should also be aware that Portland Police Bureau officers will be at every school during the first few weeks of the school year to enforce school speed zones and other traffic laws.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you drive to school, through a school zone or in neighborhoods near a school, follow these safety tips to keep all students safe this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obey the 20 mph speed limit in all school zones.</li>
<li>Be patient during drop-off and pick-up if you drive your student to school or drive near a school. The roadways surrounding schools are congested during these times.</li>
<li>Do not idle your vehicle in school zones.</li>
<li>Stop and remain stopped for pedestrians at all intersections, whether marked as a crosswalk or not: It&rsquo;s the law.</li>
<li>When turning right on a red light, look both ways for people walking and biking.</li>
<li>Be aware of students where there are no sidewalks along the road and when backing out of driveways.</li>
<li>Watch for younger and less predictable children who may dart into the road.</li>
<li>Stop and wait for school buses when red lights are flashing.</li>
<li>If your a parent, consider parking a few blocks from your child's school and walking the rest of the way. You'll reduce traffic congestion by the school and get a pleasant morning walk with your child.</li>
</ul>

News,588264,News Release: Commissioner Novick and PBOT share grief over serious injury of student struck near George Middle School,1,,2016-08-30 20:40:07 UTC,2016-08-30 20:38:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Aug. 30, 2016) - Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick and the Portland Bureau of Transportation issued the following statement after a report that a 15-year-old boy was struck by a car on North Columbia Boulevard and North Midway Avenue near George Middle School.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;We were saddened to hear about this crash, occurring in the first week of the school year for Portland Public Schools, and as other public and private schools prepare to start classes,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;This comes less than two weeks after a fatality on SE Hawthorne that took a young life and shocked and saddened all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As it does with all severe crashes, PBOT will work with the Portland Police Bureau to understand the factors that contributed to this incident. As PBOT has learned through its Vision Zero efforts, most fatal and serious injury crashes in Portland are caused by people disobeying traffic laws, including by speeding, distracted driving or by driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Until we learn more, this crash should serve as a reminder to everyone that every intersection in Oregon is a crosswalk, so people driving are required to stop and stay stopped for pedestrians attempting to cross. People driving need to pay attention to school zones and obey the 20 mph speed limit in those zones. Watch for school buses. Remember, if yellow or red lights are flashing and the stop arm is extended, traffic must stop. Speeding makes crashes with pedestrians more likely to result in fatalities or severe injuries. When a pedestrian is struck by a car traveling at 40 mph, there&rsquo;s an 80 percent chance of fatality or severe injury, while that percentage drops to 10 percent when the vehicle is traveling at 20 mph. Whether you are driving, walking, biking or using a mobility device, be aware of your surroundings and be vigilant and courteous to other people traveling on our streets.</p>

News,588343,"News Release:  Crosswalk education and enforcement action nets 4 citations, 5 warnings in one hour during highly visible campaign at Cesar Chavez K-8",1,,2016-08-31 18:53:41 UTC,2016-08-31 18:50:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gdp"">(Aug. 31, 2016) - The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau announced the results of a crosswalk safety education and enforcement action that took place today from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. at the marked crossing at N Willis Boulevard at N Courtenay Avenue to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">As part of the action, Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat, Oregon Department of Transportation Region 1 Manager Rian Windsheimer and Sasquatch from the <a href=""http://oregoniancrossing.org?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&ldquo;Oregonian Crossing&rdquo; safety campaign</a>&nbsp;crossed the street with students heading to school at Cesar Chavez K-8 this morning.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Education and enforcement actions such as today's event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries in Portland's streets.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>

<p class=""gdp"">The crossing is heavily used by school children and transit riders - as it is directly in front of Cesar Chavez K-8 School and near two TriMet bus stops.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A PBOT staff person served as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during today&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Near schools, people driving need to be especially mindful and watch out for parents and children walking and biking.&nbsp;As students head back to school, it&rsquo;s particularly important to obey traffic laws and drive safely in school zones. Drivers should also be aware that Portland Police Bureau officers will be at every school during the first few weeks of the school year to enforce school speed zones and other traffic laws.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

News,588756,News Release: PBOT to start booting vehicles with unpaid parking tickets on Wednesday,1,,2016-10-13 18:49:08 UTC,2016-09-06 19:21:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Sept. 6, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation on Wednesday will begin booting vehicles that have orders to tow issued by Multnomah County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;I asked the Council to allow PBOT to boot, rather than tow, vehicles with outstanding parking citations and fees,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;I wanted to make this change largely because the towing and vehicle storage fees are an unnecessary penalty that is particularly burdensome for people with low incomes. Booting gives folks the opportunity to pay their citations or appear in front of a judge at Multnomah County Court to resolve their outstanding citations, before they start getting hit with additional towing charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/09/1000421/1024123/img-1866_crop.jpg"" alt=""Booting demonstration"" width=""681"" height=""454"" /></p>

<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about the&nbsp;City of Portland&rsquo;s new booting policy for parking enforcement</strong></h2>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>What&rsquo;s the current process for towing vehicles due to overdue citations and fees?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""http://courts.oregon.gov/Multnomah/General_Info/Parking/Pages/towedvehicles.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Multnomah County Court</a>&nbsp;generates a &ldquo;tow list&rdquo; of vehicles with orders to tow issued by the court. The list is sent to PBOT parking enforcement and if they come across a vehicle that is on the list, PBOT contacts the contracted tow company and the vehicle is towed.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>What does this change do?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On Aug. 3, 2016, the City Council gave PBOT code authority to &ldquo;immobilize&rdquo; vehicles for booting. Instead of towing the vehicle right away, it will be booted for up to 36 hours. This gives people the opportunity to see a judge, make payment, or set up a payment plan before they accrue the additional charges associated with tows.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How does a vehicle get on the tow list?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Vehicles that have unpaid parking citations and fees totaling more than $500 and/or six delinquent citations are put on the tow list by the Multnomah County Court.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How is the Multnomah County Court involved?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As a result of legislation from the 1970s, Multnomah County Circuit Court handles all of the City&rsquo;s parking and traffic citations.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How much does it normally cost for tow and storage?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The current contractual cost of a tow is $168. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Is there an additional booting fee?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">A booting fee is not currently proposed.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How long will boots stay on vehicles in the ROW?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Boots will stay on vehicles for 36 hours before being towed. If the customer is making arrangements with the Court and more time is needed, PBOT will accommodate that. It is not the intention of PBOT to store vehicles in the ROW for a significant amount of time, however.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Will vehicles accrue parking citations while it remains on the street?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Not currently proposed.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How do customers pay the Court or see a judge?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Customers can pay the Court through the normal process in person. Payment plans can be scheduled with the Court, if needed. Customers can also see a judge at Drop in Court, Monday through Friday, from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. without an appointment. PBOT will not boot on Fridays, to allow vehicle owners to contact the Court during normal business hours and not have to wait over the weekend to have their vehicle released.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The court provides these additional details for people who have vehicles immobilized or towed. If your vehicle was immobilized or towed because of an order to tow issued by the court due to unpaid parking citations, to obtain a release for the vehicle, you MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be the registered owner; AND</li>
<li>Have a valid government issued photo ID; AND</li>
<li>Pay, in full, all outstanding citations with cash, a money order, a cashier&rsquo;s check or credit/debit card that is in your name. Payment plans may be available, if authorized by a judge.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you wish to use a credit/debit card that is in another person&rsquo;s name, the cardholder must appear with you and present a valid government issued photo ID. You cannot pay for a vehicle release over the phone or online. You and the person paying for the release of the vehicle MUST appear in person at the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Parking Citation Office, Room 106, 1021 SW 4th Avenue in Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How will the boot be removed?</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After the customer makes arrangements with the Court, PBOT parking enforcement will remove the boot immediately. PBOT projects the estimated wait time would be less than an hour.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>How much will the equipment cost PBOT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">$3,500.</p>

This project is to repair and resurface floors 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the parking garage.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Due to the nature of this project, stalls and multiple floors will be closed throughout the duration of the project. Parking garage levels 9 and 7 will also be closed to public access for two weeks starting the last week of September. Additional SmartPark garages in downtown will be open during construction, including the garages at 3rd &amp; Alder and 4th &amp; Yamhill.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">During the application of surface sealer to the garage floors there will be odors for a short time that should dissipate within a few hours. To mitigate the exposure to odors, the contractor will use fans, work at night and cover the garage&rsquo;s intake grills. However, there may still be some lingering odors in the morning. The surface sealer will not have a hazardous effect to the public. However, the public is advised to stay away from the areas receiving the sealer between the hours of application (approximately 7:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.).</p>
<p class=""gdp"">For additional questions about this construction project, please contact the City of Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Transportation at (503) 823-5185.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/589073
News,589298,News Release: The Portland Bureau of Transportation Announces Members of Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee,1,,2016-09-12 20:48:55 UTC,2016-09-12 20:45:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(September 12, 2016) Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced the members of its newly reconstituted Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee. An important tool for public engagement, PBOT's Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee informs the bureau's annual transportation budget; reviews program priorities and infrastructure project lists; and provides input on the strategy and direction for incorporating equity into PBOT's work and engaging communities that PBOT has traditionally underserved.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">All City of Portland bureaus are required to have Budget Advisory Committees. These committees provide residents the opportunity to provide important input into the budget priorities of the individual bureaus. In 2015, Director Leah Treat expanded the bureau's Budget Advisory Committee into the Bureau Advisory Committee&nbsp;in an effort to offer a more robust avenue for public input.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""PBOT believes that smart policy and programs start with the community,"" said Director Treat. ""That is why we&nbsp;seek a diversity of voices. We want to better understand the people we serve and their concerns. The committee members represent a fantastic cross-section of Portland's transportation stakeholders. Their insights will be of tremendous value and help PBOT create projects and policies that serve all Portlanders.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In July, PBOT asked Portlanders interested in PBOT and transportation policy to apply for the committee. The bureau received over thirty applications and has chosen seventeen Portlanders to serve on the committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The members of the committee are:</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Sept. 15, 2016) Portland Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick, TriMet General Manager Neil McFarlane and Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat gathered today with community leaders to celebrate an agreement that will bring sidewalks, safer crossings and more transit service to East Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After hearing from East Portland community members that improved bus service was a top priority, Commissioner Steve Novick discussed the community&rsquo;s needs with TriMet. Novick found that many of the sidewalk and crosswalk projects in the East Portland in Motion Plan would make it easier to get to transit and potentially improve bus ridership.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;""><br /></span></span><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=589793"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""191"" height=""191"" />The City Council approved Novick&rsquo;s request for $3.1 million from the City&rsquo;s General Fund to build sidewalks and crosswalk safety improvements. The improvements start this fall, with new sidewalks on NE Prescott Street. Improved bus service began Sept. 4, when TriMet created Line 73-122nd Ave. to increase rush hour frequency.</p>
<p>""I heard repeatedly four years ago from residents of East Portland that improved bus service on 122nd was a priority. I first raised the issue with TriMet in February of 2012, and at that point they didn't see an immediate path to more frequent service. Subsequently, however, TriMet said that they could more easily justify service improvements if we were able to make safety improvements along the route to make it easier to access bus stops&mdash;the same kind of safety improvements that East Portlanders have been advocating for years. We have now committed more than $6 million to make those improvements, on last year's budget and through the Fix Our Streets measure&mdash;and TriMet is delivering on its promise. Today, we celebrate years of work and collaboration by TriMet, the City, and especially the people of East Portland.""</p>
<p>On Sept. 4, TriMet rolled out the first phase of service enhancements in this area, which included splitting Line 71-60th Ave/122nd Ave into two bus lines. The renamed 71-60th Ave line continues to run on the same frequency along 60th Avenue between Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center and Clackamas Town Center. The newly created line, named Line 73-122nd Ave, operates at increased rush hour frequency between Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center and SE 94th and Foster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When looking at expanding service, we also look for ways to increase the overall access to transit, including sidewalks and safe crossings,&rdquo; McFarlane said. &ldquo;This partnership is allowing TriMet and PBOT to improve mobility, transit access and safety for riders, who are pedestrians first and last for every trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The improvements are part of PBOT&rsquo;s effort to achieve Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from our streets. The approach includes changing street design so mistakes made while traveling do not result in deaths or serious injuries. It also includes education and enforcement efforts that have been shown to reduce fatalities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commissioner Novick has shown great leadership on Vision Zero,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;The funding he secured from the City Council for sidewalks and safer crossings on this High Crash Corridor will be a great step in our efforts as a Vision Zero city. Thanks to East Portland community advocates and collaboration from TriMet, we are making it safer for people to walk and take transit, which will reduce pollution and give people healthier transportation options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s 122nd Avenue Area Safety Improvements project is investing $3.1 million in sidewalks and safer pedestrian crossings along a 6-mile corridor from NE Prescott Street to SE Foster Road, with construction from fall 2016 through fall 2017. Sidewalk improvements, new pedestrian islands and new rapid flash beacons are targeted at locations that will improve access to public transit and reduce the likelihood of fatal crashes. Learn more at the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70552?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">project web site</a>.</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program will fund additional improvements in the area, with funds approved in May when voters passed Measure 26-173, the four-year, 10-cent Portland gas tax. Over the coming years, as capital investments are completed, TriMet will continue to roll out additional bus service enhancements until Frequent Service levels are reached on the Line 73-122nd Ave. Once complete, the Line 73 will join the MAX and the other 13 designated Frequent Service bus lines that offer 15-minute of better service intervals.</p>
<p>TriMet&rsquo;s Frequent Service lines&mdash;which carry roughly 58 percent of all bus trips&mdash;connect the regional hubs where many riders live and work. In addition to providing more frequency, these lines have a number of features designed to make trips easier, faster and more comfortable including new shelters and sign poles, ADA-compliant landings and curb ramps, bus stop re-spacing and curb extensions, and improved pedestrian access.</p>
<p>PBOT includes 122nd Avenue among the city&rsquo;s 10 High Crash Corridors. The rate of pedestrian crashes is about 50 percent higher than the citywide average. The average distance between pedestrian signals or median islands is more than a quarter mile, or about 1,400 feet.</p>

<p>(September 19, 2016) Commissioner Steve Novick and Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) Director Leah Treat celebrated the first groundbreaking of the&nbsp;Fixing Our Streets program today at a base repair project at the intersection of SE 104th and Bush.</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program is the result of the passage of Measure 26-173, a ten cent tax on motor vehicle fuels and Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to street repair and traffic safety projects. Passed on May 17th, 2016, Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years. $8.6 million of the Fixing Our Streets funding will go towards base repair projects, as per the project list that was passed by Portlanders. In May, the Portland City Council also unanimously passed a Heavy Vehicle Use Tax. This separate tax for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds will also fund the Fixing Our Streets program.</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets&nbsp;includes paving, base repair, sidewalks, crossings, neighborhood greenways, safe routes to school, high crash corridors, protected bike lanes and alternative street design projects that will all have a significant impact on neighborhoods across Portland.&nbsp;An interactive map of Fixing Our Streets projects can be viewed at<a href=""http://map.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">map.fixingourstreets.com</a>.</p>
<p>Base repair projects fix those portions of a street that have failed from top to bottom. The goal of these base repair projects is to prevent the structural failure from spreading to other parts of the street.&nbsp;Thanks to Fixing Our Streets, PBOT will be able to increase the amount of base repair projects it does each year. The project at SE 104th and Bush is a high volume street one block south of Powell Boulevard, adjacent to Ed Benedict Park and the Portland Memory Garden and only a few blocks from Earl Boyles Elementary School.</p>
<img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/09/1017753/1039922/img-2031_crop.jpg"" alt=""FOS Base Repair"" hspace=""7"" width=""449"" height=""252"" align=""right"" />
<p>In addition, Fixing Our Streets will allow PBOT to complete 12 major paving projects over the four years of the program. These projects add up to approximately 30 miles of streets that will be restored to very good condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This groundbreaking is one of my proudest moments as transportation commissioner. For the past 30 years, Portland hasn&rsquo;t made the investments necessary to keep up with basic road maintenance and street repair,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;By approving the gas tax, Portlanders have made a huge statement: they would rather invest resources in improving our streets now, than let our streets continue to deteriorate. I&rsquo;m proud of Portlanders and I&rsquo;m proud of the extensive list of projects we&rsquo;re now going to be able to complete throughout the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of better streets in Portland. Today, we are kicking off the Fixing Our Streets road repair and traffic safety program and delivering on our promise to Portlanders who were willing to tax themselves for better streets and safer neighborhoods,&rdquo; said Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;When voters passed Measure 26-173 in May, they put their trust in PBOT and the City to do what we said and fix our streets. Today, we start proving their trust was well placed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PBOT has negotiated an intergovernmental agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation to collect the fuels tax on behalf of the City of Portland. Fuels tax collection will begin no later than January 1, 2017.</p>
<p>With budget authority from City Council, PBOT has already begun to work on small, but vital projects like the base repair project at SE 104th and Bush. The bureau is also working on the initial design work for the larger paving projects that are set to start next spring and summer.</p>

<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=591717"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />(Sept. 23, 2016) -- The first Speed Safety Cameras in Oregon will start issuing speeding tickets on Saturday, after 30 days of issuing warnings that have already reduced top-end speeding by 93 percent.</p>
<p>The goal of the Speed Safety Cameras is to reduce speeding and save lives. The SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway corridor is part of Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Network of roads. PBOT&rsquo;s recent Vision Zero crash data analysis found that Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway is one of the top roads where people driving are killed or seriously injured. People walking along or crossing on foot are twice as likely to be struck by a car than on the average city street.</p>
<p>Cameras started issuing warnings on Aug. 25, the start of a 30-day period that ends on Saturday. The warnings have already reduced top-end speeding along the corridor, where about 25,000 vehicles travel each day and the speed limit is 40 mph:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Before the cameras were installed, an average 1,417 vehicles a day traveled 51 mph or faster, according to readings by a pneumatic&nbsp;tube laid across the roadway.</li>
<li>During the warning period from Aug. 24 to Sept. 18, an average 93 vehicles a day were found traveling 51 mph or faster -- a 93.4 percent reduction from the tube count.</li>
<li>In the first week of the warning period, cameras recorded an average 115 violations a day. Violations dropped to an average 72 a day by the week of Sept. 12 to 18.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Speed Safety Cameras have a proven track record in other cities, and are already showing their effectiveness in Portland,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat, &ldquo;For us to reach our Vision Zero goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries, we need tools like these cameras. Thanks to the City Council and state Legislature, we can use this proven tool and save lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;It's amazing to see how quickly these safety cameras have reduced dangerous speeding on Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;I'm so glad these cameras have already improved safety&nbsp;on a busy street where pedestrians face a terribly high crash rate.""</p>

<p><em>VIDEO: Safety cameras recorded video of a white SUV traveling at 72 mph, available at the <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTYwOTIzLjY0MTY0NzUxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE2MDkyMy42NDE2NDc1MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MDgwNTg3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://youtu.be/1z9TkkAGgSs?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PBOT YouTube</a> channel.</em></p>
<p>The installation on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway is the first safety camera installation since the City of Portland and community safety advocates convinced the state Legislature in 2015 to pass HB 2621, which allows them to be used on High Crash Corridors in the Portland city limits. The City of Portland has been using other cameras to supplement speed enforcement for years, with police officers in vans enforcing speed limit violations. Portland also uses cameras to increase enforcement compliance with red lights at traffic signals.</p>
<p>Safety Cameras are a proven safety tool that can reduce dangerous speeding and save lives. The cameras are mounted along High Crash Corridors and when people driving past them exceed the posted speed limit, they capture photos and video for review by Portland Police. The Speed Safety Cameras issued warnings for the first 30 days of operation. An officer from the Portland Police Bureau will review violations before a citation is issued. The typical fine will be $160.</p>
<p>HB 2621&nbsp;requires that money received from the speeding tickets can only be spent to cover the cost of the program or pay for safety improvements and programs on High Crash Corridors. Additional cameras will be installed during by spring 2017 at SE 122nd Avenue between Foster and Powell Boulevards, Marine Drive and Outer SE Division Street.</p>

<p><em>Photo by Gabe Graff, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>The Speed Safety Cameras program provides ample warning to people driving in the area. State law requires&nbsp;speed signage and speed reader boards to be installed on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway warning drivers more than 100 yards in advance of the cameras in both directions. PBOT staff also conducted extensive outreach with local neighborhood associations as well as more than 75 businesses and community organizations to raise awareness of the changes along the corridor, before the cameras were installed.</p>
<p>In addition to the new cameras, PBOT is delivering three additional safety and maintenance projects on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway beginning this fall that reflect the goals of the Southwest Community Plan and the Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway High Crash Corridor Safety Plan.</p>
<p>Among the included projects:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Paving maintenance:&nbsp;PBOT will perform a two-inch grind and pave maintenance project, resulting in new pavement from SW 21st/Bertha Court to SW 35th&nbsp;Avenue to be delivered this fall 2016.</li>
<li>Safety Demonstration Project:&nbsp;PBOT will deliver a Safety Demonstration Project on Beaverton Hillsdale Highway in spring 2017. The project includes a new marked pedestrian crossing with a median island with Rapid Flashing Beacons at 35th Avenue, a protected pedestrian/bike lane space, reduced travel lane widths, and new ADA-compliant pedestrian curb ramps.</li>
<li>Stormwater Improvements:&nbsp;PBOT and the Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) are partnering to install stormwater curb extensions on at Shattuck. These will shorten the pedestrian crossings and ADA curb ramps will be constructed at all corners. Construction will be completed in the 2016/2017 fiscal year.</li>

News,591991,"News Release: PBOT booting program nets 21 vehicles with $83,000 in overdue parking citations",1,,2016-09-27 16:31:51 UTC,2016-09-27 16:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Sept. 27, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation's parking enforcement program has applied parking boots to 21 vehicles that had overdue parking citations totaling $82,795 in less than three weeks, the bureau announced today.</p>
<p><img src=""http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/09/1025664/1047271/booting-close-up-white-car_crop.jpg"" alt=""Booting close up white car"" hspace=""7"" width=""188"" height=""151"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>PBOT started using parking boots on Sept. 7. As of Monday, Sept. 26, enforcement officers had booted 21 vehicles, of which 10 were released to the owner by the&nbsp;Multnomah County Circuit Court, nine were towed for lack of payment and two were still remaining on the street with the parking boot applied.</p>
<p>In August, the Portland City Council approved a new policy allowing PBOT parking enforcement to use parking boots. PBOT uses boots to immobilize a vehicle for up to 36 hours, allowing the owner time to settle outstanding citations with the court. This approach allows people to pay their tickets, and avoid towing fees. After booting, the vehicle is towed if the vehicle owner has still not settled with the court for outstanding citations, and normal fees apply.</p>
<p>""Everyone needs to pay their parking tickets,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;I&nbsp;wanted PBOT to start booting largely because the towing and vehicle storage fees are an unnecessary penalty that is particularly burdensome for people with low incomes. In recent weeks, we've heard that people are going to court and settling up their outstanding tickets and that's great. Our parking enforcement program helps make sure everyone is following the rules of the road.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Vehicle owners who have questions about outstanding parking citations can call&nbsp;503-988-3235, option 2 or see the court's&nbsp;<a href=""http://courts.oregon.gov/Multnomah/General_Info/Parking/Pages/ParkingHome.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">web site on parking citations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Booting gives vehicle owners the opportunity to pay their citations or appear in front of a judge at Multnomah County Court to resolve their outstanding citations, before they start getting hit with additional towing charges.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT's parking enforcement operation is a crucial part of the city's management of public space, said Transportation Director Leah Treat.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Parking spaces are an important part of the public space that PBOT manages for Portlanders,"" Treat said. ""Our parking rules are essential to manage public space in the public interest. We issue citations to make sure everyone is following the rules. Enforcement helps our parking system provide Portlanders with the access to homes and businesses that we all enjoy every day.""</p>

News,593297,News Blog: Portland in the Streets: New Stakeholder Advisory Committee to Guide PBOT’s Livable Streets Strategy,1,,2016-10-07 18:51:50 UTC,2016-10-06 22:33:00 UTC,A,,"<p dir=""ltr""><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=593294"" alt=""portland in the streets logo"" width=""350"" height=""110.039177277"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">(Oct. 6, 2016) - Tomorrow, Friday, October 7, is the first Stakeholder Advisory Committee (SAC) meeting for one of PBOT&rsquo;s newest initiatives: the Livable Streets Strategy.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Back in May, City Council proclaimed the summer of 2016 to be Portland in the Streets season. This proclamation highlighted that open streets events and initiatives like block parties, Sunday Parkways and our new Ankeny Plaza offer Portland residents and visitors the opportunity to experience their streets and their city in new and exciting ways. View our <a href=""http://www.portlandinthestreets.com"">Portland in the Streets interactive map</a> to learn more about these community-building events and places.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In response to the recognition of the importance of these community-based places and events, PBOT is now developing our Livable Streets Strategy - a roadmap for the City that will reinforce the idea that public streets are public places to be enjoyed by all ages and abilities.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=593295"" alt=""Ankeny Plaza"" width=""670"" height=""446.666666667"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><em>Portland's newest public space, Ankeny Plaza, at SW 3rd and Ankeny. Photo by Felicity J. Mackay, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The strategy will support innovation in the public right-of-way by opening Portland&rsquo;s streets, parking spaces, plazas, and alleys to a range of events, programming, and physical infrastructure. The Livable Streets SAC is responsible for providing direction to the Project Management Team to guide development of the Livable Streets Strategy vision, goals, policy-recommendations, actions, and performance measures. Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Looking at how we can better open our streets (our largest form of public space) to all Portlanders.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Providing guidance to the Bureau on how we design and manage those spaces in the public right-of-way. A critical piece of the work on the Livable Streets Strategy is the work on the nuts and bolts of the permit process.</p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr"">Making it easier for community organizations to follow and understand the permit process so they can easily activate their own street.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ultimately, our goal is to create a citywide program that helps community groups create and activate their own spaces, that are unique to their own neighborhoods. The SAC will help provide understanding and reflection upon trends in community placemaking, barriers to community involvement, potential for public/private partnerships, and opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=593296"" alt=""intersection repair project"" width=""670"" height=""472.519455253"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Because the Livable Streets Strategy is looking at ways to open our streets to all Portlanders, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee was formed with that broad reach in mind. Artists, community members, the business community, and placemaking experts will come together to advise the program process, as well as provide their expertise on the community experience for implementing placemaking projects and programs. <a href=""/transportation/article/592964"">You can view a list of committee members here.</a> We recognize there are current barriers to implementing these types of projects, and the SAC will help identify these barriers to be addressed in the Livable Streets Strategy. &nbsp;The SAC will meet five times between now through spring 2017. Meeting information will be posted on the <a href=""/transportation/71710"">Livable Streets Strategy project website.</a> Tomorrow&rsquo;s SAC meeting will take place from 1:30 to 3:00 p.m. in the Portland Building&rsquo;s Broadway Conference Room. All meetings are open to the public.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A critical piece of the Livable Streets Strategy is the work on the nuts and bolts of the permit process. This involves coordination and collaboration among a number of City of Portland bureaus. Therefore, in addition to a SAC we are convening a Livable Streets Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) which will be responsible for providing technical expertise on areas including, but not limited to policy goals and language, the permitting process, traffic engineering, implementation, maintenance, enforcement, community outreach, and data collection. The TAC is comprised largely of technical staff from across City of Portland bureaus that are involved in various community and neighborhood event processes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to working with the Livable Streets SAC and TAC, PBOT will be conducting a broader community survey to get input on the broader vision and goals. We want to hear from the community at large about the placemaking projects or programs that are important to them and their community. The survey will also continue to collect information on the barriers community members are facing currently when applying for community event and use permits with the City of Portland. In the meantime, please take a look at some of the existing Livable Streets projects happening in Portland on our <a href=""http://www.portlandinthestreets.com"">Portland in the Streets interactive map</a>. It&rsquo;s the perfect time to start planning next summer&rsquo;s block party and/or street fair!</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/593297

<p>By Dylan Rivera<br />PBOT staff</p>
<p>(Oct. 12, 2016) Dozens of children had a surprise on their way to school at Gilbert Park Elementary last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Commissioner Steve Novick, Transportation Director Leah Treat, David Douglas Superintendent Ken Richardson and safety advocates joined the grade schoolers and their families in walking to Gilbert Park Elementary. The grownups and students celebrated International Walk + Roll to School Day.</p>
<p>And they were able to celebrate something more than symbolism: New sidewalks were completed over the summer, thanks to a state grant the Portland Bureau of Transportation obtained for building safer routes to two East Portland schools.</p>

<h2><strong>VIDEO</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Stacie Moncrief, principal at Gilbert Park Elementary talks about how new sidewalks have opened up new possibilities for students and families.&nbsp;<a href=""https://youtu.be/mA6m3m1Ib9w?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">See her on PBOT's YouTube channel.</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The community and myself were really looking forward to having the sidewalk come in,&rdquo; said Stacie Moncrief, principal at Gilbert Park Elementary. &ldquo;Now I feel comfortable partnering with PBOT Safe Routes, so we can do more activities, and do more events to promote walking and biking to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The $1.5 million Powellhurst-Gilbert Safe Routes to School Project built sidewalks on two east-west corridors. On SE Holgate, the paths run from bustling SE 122nd Avenue to Gilbert Heights Elementary School. On SE Ramona Street, they connect 122nd Avenue to Alice Ott Middle School and Moncrief&rsquo;s Gilbert Park Elementary.</p>
<p>Families at 46 schools across Portland had registered their plans to celebrate the international day for walking, biking and rolling to school last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walking to school makes kids safer and heathier,&rdquo; Novick said. The city will be able to install more sidewalks because voters in May approved a 10-cent gas tax, known as the Fixing Our Streets Program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re celebrating the fact that it&rsquo;s now easier for kids to walk to school in this area,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;With the Fixing Our Streets program, we&rsquo;re going to be able to improve the sidewalk network around David Douglas High School and on 122nd Avenue so it&rsquo;s easier for seniors and students to get to bus stops on that route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treat said that she&rsquo;s proud that Portland students ride to school at eight times the national average. Bicycling and walking to school has increased 35 percent since 2006.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biking and walking to school introduces children to an active lifestyle that can last a lifetime,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;As a mom and a transportation director, making sure children have safe routes to school is a high priority for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danita Wakamatsu, whose daughter Manaia attends kindergarten at Gilbert Park, said she&rsquo;s glad to see so many people celebrating safe routes to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides camaraderie and bonding in the community, it&rsquo;s nice to see people come together and do better for the environment and have fun at the same time,&rdquo; Wakamatsu said. She&rsquo;s hoping to have more facilities for biking and walking in the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she had more space to run and walk around instead of us having to drive,&rdquo; Wakamatsu said.</p>

<h3><em>Clear storm drains in advance of heavy rain; all travelers should use caution</em></h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Oct. 13, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for high winds and heavy rain that could create hazardous traveling conditions tonight and Saturday. The National Weather Service has issued a high wind warning for the Portland area from 2 to 10 p.m., with the strongest winds from 4 to 9 p.m.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Wind speeds are expected to reach 15 to 30 mph, with gusts of 35 to 45 mph.&nbsp;Winds of this strength could make travel hazardous by bringing&nbsp;fallen trees, tree limbs, and power lines into streets. Debris can also block storm drains, leading to street flooding.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT asks the traveling public, residents and businesses to take steps to reduce hazards associated with these conditions.&nbsp;The best way to prevent streets from flooding is for everyone to help keep Portland's 58,000 storm drains clear before a storm arrives. Use a rake, shovel or broom and clear by standing in the sidewalk, not the street. Be aware of passing vehicles and check the drain again during and after a storm.&nbsp;It's also a good idea to clear inlets that lead stormwater to the green street planters in city streets.&nbsp;See more tips at&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/pdxstormdrains?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">http://bit.ly/pdxstormdrains</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">All travelers should be alert, regardless of how they are moving throughout the city:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When driving,&nbsp;go slowly.</strong>&nbsp;Use extra care and look for people walking or biking.&nbsp;Adjust your speed to the road conditions and leave yourself plenty of room to stop.&nbsp;If a storm knocks out power to traffic signals, treat intersections like an all-way stop and proceed with caution. The driver who stops first has the right of way to go first.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Do not drive through standing water or around barricades</strong>&nbsp;on flooded streets. Turn around safely. The wake from your vehicle can cause public and private property damage and flood houses and businesses.</li>
<li><strong>When biking,</strong>&nbsp;allow plenty of stopping distance and avoid road surfaces that are steel, painted or covered in leaves or water. A puddles can disguise a very deep pothole.</li>
<li><strong>When walking,&nbsp;</strong>always cross at a marked crosswalk or at an intersection. Look for oncoming vehicles before stepping down from the sidewalk and make eye contact with drivers when possible.&nbsp;Remember that people driving may have difficulty stopping in rainy conditions. Make sure you are seen by wearing contrasting clothing or retro-reflective materials when it&rsquo;s dark outside.</li>
<li><strong>When taking public transit,</strong>&nbsp;check for service alerts before you go at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.trimet.org/alerts"">trimet.org/alerts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/"">portlandstreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">See more travel tips on PBOT's web site:&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/rainytravel?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">http://bit.ly/rainytravel</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews are prepared to close streets and may set up detour routes for closures of long duration.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Residents are advised to notify PBOT of debris, mud, rocks, trees, or branches blocking a street by calling our 24/7 maintenance dispatch hotline at 503-823-1700. Property owners should keep sidewalks clear of small debris.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">During a severe weather event, many people may report the same incident. Residents may find it more convenient to report using the&nbsp;<a href=""/53613?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PDX Reporter App</a>&nbsp;on Apple and Android smartphones. To report standing water on a roadway, use the category Plugged Storm Drain/Inlet. To report rock or mudslides or other debris blocking a travel lane, use the Debris in Roadway category. We strongly encourage the public to submit photos with their service requests, because that helps PBOT crews assess changing conditions as they respond to reports.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) will continue to monitor the Sycamore gauge for Johnson Creek water levels. See the gauge at&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/2ewbCdK?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">http://bit.ly/2ewbCdK</a>. Bank full is 10 feet; flood stage is 11 feet; and with the restoration work that BES has done in the Foster Floodplain Natural Area, it now takes about 13 feet for Johnson Creek to flood.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The last observed level was about 2.79 feet (11:30 a.m. on Oct. 13), and it is predicted to reach 4.55 feet at midnight tonight and 9.22 feet by 6 a.m. Friday, Oct. 14. So, there is a possibility that Johnson Creek may approach bank full by early Friday morning, but it is not expected to flood.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To help residents and business owners prepare for a flood emergency,&nbsp;sand and sandbags are available at no charge to anyone who wants to use them to protect their property from flood damage. City crews keep the sites stocked with sand and sand bags. No shovels are provided, so the public must bring their own.&nbsp;Locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SE&nbsp;88th Avenue just south of&nbsp;Holgate Boulevard in the parking lot at Lents Park. Enter parking&nbsp;lot at the bottom of the hill, and follow one-way traffic to the sand pile at the exit on the east side of SE 88th;</li>
<li>SE 111th Avenue and Harold Street at the southeast corner of the intersection; and</li>
<li>SW 42nd&nbsp;Avenue and&nbsp;Vermont Street in&nbsp;the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park; enter Gabriel Park from Vermont.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">If travelers encounter downed utility wires or power lines in the Portland area, they should call 911. Never touch a downed power line. In fact, do not even get close. Even if a power line is not sparking, it could still be energized. Remember that water and electricity do not mix. Never try to free lines or to remove tree limbs from lines by yourself.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition, to report power outages or downed lines, contact&nbsp;PGE at 503-464-7777 or Pacific Power at&nbsp;1-877-508-5088. To report traffic signals out, call PBOT's&nbsp;24/7 dispatch hotline&nbsp;at 503-823-1700.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City recommends Portlanders monitor conditions where they are planning to travel, watch the forecast, and use&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.publicalerts.org"">www.PublicAlerts.org</a>&nbsp;as their source for emergency updates. The site provides links to street closures, highway road conditions, transit schedules and service alerts, and other emergency information.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT's Get Home Safe campaign informs the public about what the Transportation Bureau does to help Portlanders travel safely during severe fall and winter weather and what Portlanders can do to prepare for travel during severe weather.<img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/10/1046058/1071863/pbot-gethomesafe-640x295-2016_crop.png"" alt=""Get Home Safe"" width=""592"" height=""272"" /></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/594479

<p dir=""ltr"">The traffic signal will significantly benefit Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/65570"">Colwood Golf Center</a> redevelopment project, which is finishing up construction. The striping work for the updated intersection had to be done in the middle of the night due to very heavy traffic volumes, underscoring the need for the new signal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-adf875d1-e3c6-67d4-947b-00668ba955bf"">&ldquo;This is like Christmas coming early knowing that I will not have to use that intersection during the dark winter, with no traffic lights, again,&rdquo; said area resident Sally Rivard.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=594907"" alt=""Freight on Alderwood/Columbia"" width=""300"" height=""168.75"" /></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The new signal will also help manage traffic for the many freight companies in the area, which had been experiencing backups as a result of a 45-day closure to motorized traffic that began Sept. 26 at NE Cornfoot Road near its intersection with Alderwood.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;This will make the current situation with Cornfoot closed so much better,&rdquo; said Pia Welch, Chair of the Portland Freight Committee. Completing the project ahead of the holiday season will also &nbsp;help freight companies move shipments more efficiently during their busiest time of year.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The new signal is funded by the NE 47th Avenue Phase I Local Improvement District (LID). &nbsp;The LID is a partnership between PBOT, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the Bureau of Environmental Services and the Portland Water Bureau who are all undertaking capital improvement projects in the area.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;This traffic signal is a sign of great things happening in the Cully area,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see PBOT and other bureaus working together to make freight improvements that will also make the Cully area safer for people biking, walking and taking public transit.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">PBOT will also be fully reconstructing NE 47th from Columbia to south of Cornfoot. The current pavement is in some of the worst condition in the city. The Transportation Bureau will also build new sidewalks, protected bike lanes in the form of a multi-use path and install a rapid flashing beacon so that pedestrians can safely cross the street.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Other projects happening as part of the LID include:</p>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">Adding sanitary sewer to serve properties currently on septic.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Adding stormwater sewer to begin properly managing and disposing of stormwater that currently flows untreated into the Columbia Slough.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Replacing a century-old cast iron water main.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">Integrating all improvements with Parks' Whitaker Ponds park project going to construction next year.</li>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>(October 26, 2016) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau will conduct a crosswalk safety education and enforcement action on Thursday, October 27 at the marked crossing on SW 40<sup>th</sup> Avenue and SW Huber Street beginning at 10:30 a.m. to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws. PBOT also reminds Portlanders to use extra caution while using city streets and sidewalks on Halloween.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595673"" alt=""vision zero logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Children all across Portland will take to the streets to trick-or-treat for Halloween on Monday evening. The&nbsp;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that Halloween is consistently one of the top three days for pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that children are four times more likely to be struck by a motor vehicle on Halloween than any other day of the year. Because excited trick-or-treaters often forget about safety, people driving and parents must be even more alert. Everyone should focus on being visible and to watch out for other travelers. Add lights and reflectors to your child's costume - it's a fun and easy way to help keep children safe as they trick or treat.</p>
<p>Drivers can do their part by driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling and being ready to stop as needed.&nbsp;People walking and bicycling are encouraged to be more visible by wearing retro-reflective wear, using a flashlight or blinking strobe, and investing in bright and contrasting outerwear.</p>
<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the October 27<sup>th</sup> event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, people driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=595670"" alt=""SW 40th and Huber"" width=""300"" height=""151.956181534"" />The SW 40<sup>th</sup> Avenue and SW Huber Street crossing has painted lines at the crosswalk and signage to alert drivers to the possible presence of people walking in the crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers or bicyclists who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.&nbsp; PBOT encourages everyone who crosses the street to exercise care and caution when walking, biking or driving. Sharon White, PBOT, will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Thursday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to members of the traveling public. PBOT and PPB partner to conduct education and enforcement actions throughout the year to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

News,595714,News Release: Portland Debuts BIKETOWN for All,1,,2016-11-01 19:15:56 UTC,2016-10-27 07:00:00 UTC,A,,"<h2 class=""content-center"">Portland becomes only the third US city to offer a cash option to purchase a bike share membership</h2>
<p class=""gd_p content-center""><strong>Discounted memberships now available for Portlanders living on low incomes</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Oct. 27, 2016) - Delivering on its promise to develop an equitable bike share system, Portland&rsquo;s bike share program, BIKETOWN, announced a new program today called&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN for All</a>. The program will provide an opportunity for Portlanders living on low incomes to become members of BIKETOWN and pay with cash. It will also provide bike safety education and free helmets to BIKETOWN for All members.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN for All is a partnership between the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.communitycyclingcenter.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Community Cycling Center</a>&nbsp;(CCC), the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Bureau of Transportation</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.motivateco.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Motivate</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://betterbikeshare.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Better Bike Share Partnership</a>, and participating affordable housing communities, social service agencies and local nonprofits.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portlanders living on low incomes and who are affiliated with participating housing, social service and community organizations can sign up and receive a discounted membership for $3 per month.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN for All was first piloted with the residents from Alder House Apartments in partnership with&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.thegivingtreenw.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">The Giving Tree NW</a>, a community building organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Having a cash membership option is a game changer in making bike share accessible for low-income Portlanders,"" said the Giving Tree NW&rsquo;s Heather Morrill. ""I know I will see many of my clients riding BIKETOWN who otherwise would not have access to this transportation and recreation option.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting more exercise and I&rsquo;m getting things done at the same time,&rdquo; said BIKETOWN for All member Jon Horton, who regularly uses BIKETOWN for both errands and getting to work. &ldquo;Now with BIKETOWN, it cuts my commuting time for whatever I&rsquo;m doing or wherever I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland resident Sandy Crutchfield said, &ldquo;I live in senior housing and I don&rsquo;t have a car. I like to get outside as much as possible and I know the bikes will help me venture further. I am looking forward to new adventures thanks to BIKETOWN.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Community Cycling Center (CCC) will arrange with housing, social service or nonprofit organizations to promote BIKETOWN for All memberships with their residents or clients. The CCC will usually hold a workshop at the referring organization&rsquo;s site describing how BIKETOWN works, including how to check out and unlock a bike. The workshop includes a bike ride covering essential skills for city bike riding. At the end of the workshop, participants can purchase a BIKETOWN for All membership at the cost of $9 for three months, or $3 per month. This membership provides the rider up to 90 minutes of daily ride time.&nbsp;To serve Portlanders without credit or debit cards, BIKETOWN has partnered with Portland Parks and Recreation to make cash payments possible.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Since BIKETOWN&rsquo;s launch this summer, we&rsquo;ve heard from &nbsp;Portlanders and visitors being able to use a bike in the city for the first time,&rdquo; said Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;But cost may be prohibitive for many people throughout the city who would like to give it a try. Thanks to the Community Cycling Center, we&rsquo;ve been able to expand BIKETOWN, making it more equitable and accessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;To help ease congestion, reduce our carbon footprint and support healthier lifestyles, we want to encourage Portlanders from all walks of life to enjoy the benefits of biking,&rdquo; said PBOT&rsquo;s Director, Leah Treat. &ldquo;In less than four months, BIKETOWN has proven to be one of our most effective and visible means of spreading our active transportation message. Now with BIKETOWN for All, we&rsquo;re taking a major step forward. By becoming only the third US city to offer a low-cost cash membership option, we are making it even easier for more Portlanders to get out and ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""The launch of BIKETOWN earlier this year served as a powerful and promising beginning to a whole new way of experiencing bicycling in Portland,&rdquo; said Mychal Tetteh, Chief Executive Officer of the Community Cycling Center. &ldquo;At the Community Cycling Center, we believe that Portland&rsquo;s bike share system should provide the highest levels of access and affordability. We are committed to developing the partnerships needed to ensure our bike share system meets the needs of the greatest number of people. We've begun developing cash-based options for Portland's unbanked residents through our BIKETOWN for All program. Creating access to bicycles that people can share remains at a core of our mission. We are excited to work with community partners to ensure that bike share is accessible and affordable to the greatest number of people in Portland.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Initially, BIKETOWN for All memberships will only be available through participating affordable housing, social service and nonprofit organizations. People interested in obtaining a BIKETOWN for All membership should speak to their case manager or resident service manager and ask them to complete an interest form available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.BIKETOWNforAll.org</a>. In the future, BIKETOWN for All workshops will be open to individuals who are not connected with a referral agency. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN for All is funded in part by a grant from the Better Bike Share Partnership. Motivate is providing an in-kind donation of up to $54,000 by reducing the cost of 500 annual memberships to $3 per month.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Housing, social service or nonprofit organizations interested in participating in BIKETOWN for All should complete the interest form available at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.BIKETOWNforAll.org</a>.&nbsp;Memberships are available now.</p>

<h1>News Blog: Leaf Day is coming!</h1>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 3, 2016) - A quarter million trees drop a lot of leaves&nbsp;&ndash; and when they fall in an urban environment, it's necessary to clean them up.&nbsp;That&rsquo;s why PBOT&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/leafday?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Leaf Day</a>&nbsp;program is so important.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">From mid-November to mid-December, removing leaves from our streets is critical because letting them stay&nbsp;on the street can clog storm drains, flood intersections&nbsp;and make streets slippery.&nbsp;Leaf Dayis designed to clear our streets of many of the leaves that fall as the season changes. By participating in Leaf Day, you help to ensure safer and cleaner streets for you, your neighbors and all Portlanders.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>This year we made a number of changes to our program based on the feedback we heard from residents.</strong>&nbsp;Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaf Day is starting later. We heard you. We&rsquo;ll be starting Leaf Day two weeks later this year to allow for more leaves to fall ahead of our first pickup day on November 12.</li>
<li>New Leaf Day districts. We&rsquo;ve reconfigured the Leaf Day service districts to be smaller, which allows for more flexibility and better responsiveness.</li>
<li>Fewer Sunday pickups, no Thanksgiving weekend pickups. That means less noise in neighborhoods on the weekend and a quiet Thanksgiving holiday for all.</li>
<li>Digital reminders! Stay in the loop about Leaf Day by&nbsp;<a href=""https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/subscriber/new?topic_id=ORPORTLAND_81"">signing up for weekly email and/or text message updates</a>&nbsp;with schedules and tips for making the most of your Leaf Day service.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Leaf Day begins on November 12. Here&rsquo;s how you can make the most of your&nbsp;<a href=""/leafday?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Leaf Day</a>&nbsp;service:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visit us online at&nbsp;<a href=""/leafday?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">portlandoregon.gov/leafday</a>&nbsp;to confirm which Leaf Day Service Zone you&rsquo;re in, and when your service will be.</li>
<li>Our regular Leaf Day service clears your street tree leaves, but what about tree leaves on the sidewalk or elsewhere on your property? No problem: we&rsquo;ll take those, too. Simply rake them into the street the day before your Leaf Day(s).&nbsp;<strong>Remember: only tree leaves, not any other kind of yard debris.</strong></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Help us help you! Remove obstacles like basketball hoops from the street, cut tree branches lower than eleven feet from the ground (our machines are tall) and relocate your vehicles off the road on your Leaf Day. By doing these things, you&rsquo;ll make it easier for our machines to hug the curb and get your street cleaner as a result.<img class=""govd_template_image content-center"" style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 12px;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1083491/1097626/move-your-car_crop.jpg"" alt=""Move your car on Leaf Day"" width=""422"" height=""382"" /></li>

News,597383,News Blog: “Be Seen. Be Safe.” Traffic safety during the darker days of the year,1,,2016-11-07 23:06:20 UTC,2016-11-07 20:41:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 7, 2016) - Daylight savings time ended on Sunday, so it&rsquo;s time to step up your visibility and make sure you&rsquo;re doing your part to travel with care.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1087450/1101636/pexels-photo-67088_crop.jpeg"" alt=""night driving"" hspace=""7"" width=""274"" height=""183"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>People driving can increase visibility by using their headlights, leaving a safe distance between vehicles to increase your cone of vision, and continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling. Always be alert and practice extra caution during winter&rsquo;s rain and low light. Depth perception, color recognition and peripheral vision can be compromised in the dark, and the glare of headlights from an oncoming vehicle can significantly impact a driver&rsquo;s vision. Even with high-beam headlights on, visibility is limited creating less time to react to something in the road, especially when driving at higher speeds.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</span>People driving need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to practice patience and slow down</li>
<li>Stay in your lane and beware of drivers who dart from lane to lane</li>
<li>Even though the route may be familiar, don't go on autopilot; stay alert and ALWAYS watch for vulnerable road users such as people walking, biking and rolling</li>
<li>Don't touch your phone, eat, drink or do other things that are distracting</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">Did you know that as we age we have greater difficulty seeing at night? Night vision is the ability to see well in low-light conditions. A 50-year-old driver may need twice as much light to see as well as a 30-year-old. The American Optometric Association recommends older drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have annual vision exams</li>
<li>Reduce speed</li>
<li>Take a driving course; even experienced drivers can benefit from a refresher course, and some of the rules have probably changed</li>
<li>Minimize distractions, like talking with passengers or listening to the radio</li>
<li>Check with your doctor about side effects of prescription drugs</li>
<li>Limit driving to daytime hours if necessary</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 12px;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1087451/1101637/dscn1843_crop.jpg"" alt=""be seen be safe outreach"" hspace=""7"" width=""269"" height=""202"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">People walking and biking can increase their visibility during low-light hours by wearing reflective gear and using safety lights.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Did you know that you&rsquo;re first visible to people driving from 500 feet away when you&rsquo;re wearing reflective clothing? Compare this to just 55 feet away when wearing dark colors with no reflective gear or lights.</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s coordinated &ldquo;Be Seen. Be safe.&rdquo; street teams (volunteers and staff) will be out at busy intersections, high crash corridor roadways, and other key locations this week handing out safety lights and reflective stickers while encouraging Portland&rsquo;s more vulnerable road users to brighten up their attire during the darker fall and winter months.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Find PBOT staff and community volunteers at the following locations this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"">Monday, Nov. 7, 4:30 &ndash; 6:00 PM &ndash; N Williams Ave/NE Morris to NE Going</span></li>

News,619054,News Blog: Better crash data will sharpen Vision Zero focus,1,,2016-11-23 21:00:59 UTC,2016-11-15 20:58:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p""><em>By Matt Ferris-Smith, Portland Bureau of Transportation</em></p>

<p>(Nov. 15, 2016)&nbsp;Crash data helps PBOT decide where and how to invest in safety. But the time between when a crash happens and when the data reach PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero team for analysis can take months.</p>
<p>Reducing that delay, and gathering better data on the role of speed, impairment and distraction in crashes, are key pieces of Portland&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://plan.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">draft Vision Zero Action Plan</a>.</p>
<p>The Action Plan includes&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71739?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">three items</a>&nbsp;that will make crash data faster and more thorough:</p>
<ul>
<li>EA.5&nbsp;Improve timeliness of deadly and serious crash data processing and reporting</li>
<li>EA.8&nbsp;Secure increased funding and personnel to staff timely investigation of deadly crashes</li>
<li>EA.9&nbsp;Improve data collection on speed, impairment, and distraction at serious and deadly crashes</li>
</ul>
<p>Other data-related actions call on PBOT to crosscheck crash data with&nbsp;<a href=""https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EMSTraumaSystems/TraumaSystems/Pages/registry.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">trauma data</a>&nbsp;to identify discrepancies, and to review crash and equity data regularly with Portland Police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vision Zero is data-driven and has a fast timeline, which means we need to have the best data possible, as quickly as possible, guiding our investments,&rdquo; says Clay Veka, PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero Project Manager.</p>
<p>Life of a crash: How data reaches PBOT</p>
<p>Before getting to PBOT, crash data touches as many as four groups: the public, the DMV, Portland Police and the Oregon Department of Transportation (see figure).</p>
<p>Most crash data is self-reported through the DMV. People in Oregon who are involved in a crash must&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/pages/driverid/accidentreport.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">submit a DMV form</a>&nbsp;if that crash (1) involves a motor vehicle, and (2) results in an injury or at least $1,500 in property damage.</p>
<p>Portland Police gather data only on the most serious crashes&mdash;those that result in a crash victim traveling in an ambulance, or when emergency responders enter victims into the trauma system. Compared to self-reported crashes, police gather and report more detailed information on crashes, such as alcohol use. (<a href=""/transportation/article/597512?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">View the DMV form that police use</a>.)</p>
<p>Both self-reported and police data are sent to ODOT for analysis and reporting. ODOT makes the official crash record available to PBOT and the public about 10 months after the end of the year reported; for example, the agency released crash data for the year 2013 in November 2014.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image content-center"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1097117/1110229/how-crash-data-reaches-pbot_crop.png"" alt=""How crash data reaches PBOT"" width=""591"" height=""431"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Vision Zero will reduce delay, fill gaps</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Under Vision Zero, PBOT will work with the DMV, Portland Police and ODOT to accelerate the release of data on crashes that result in deaths or serious injuries.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Vision Zero also needs better data on the role of speed, impairment and distraction in serious crashes. Records from 2004 to 2013 show that speed and impairment were factors in 47 percent and 56 percent of Portland&rsquo;s deadly crashes, respectively. Conversations with traffic investigators and safety experts suggest that the actual numbers are probably higher. Distracted driving is also likely underreported.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Excluded entirely are crashes not involving motor vehicles, which includes incidents in which people biking crash on rail tracks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As Vision Zero moves forward, more timely and comprehensive crash data will help PBOT make smarter, quicker decisions about safety investments, says Veka, who adds that equity will also play a role.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Our Task Force made it clear that they want a process that uses both&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/595691?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">crash data&nbsp;</a>and<a href=""/transportation/71733?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#CommunitiesConcern"">equity data&nbsp;</a>to guide our Vision Zero investments. We&rsquo;ll be using both to prioritize improvements in the areas that need them most.&rdquo;</p>

The work is scheduled for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, when the tram experiences lower than normal use and closes for the national holiday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">During the closure, shuttle buses will run between Oregon Health &amp; Science University&rsquo;s South Waterfront and Marquam Hill campuses. Passengers can catch a shuttle bus from the Center for Health &amp; Healing in South Waterfront and the Kohler Pavilion roundabout on Marquam Hill.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The closure will allow crews to replace the tram&rsquo;s haul rope. The haul rope, used to propel the tram cabins from one station to the other, must be replaced periodically. It was last replaced in 2010.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Portland Aerial Tram is one of the busiest aerial tramways in the world, providing more than 12 million rides since opening in 2007. After more than 21,800 hours and 325,000 trips, the haul rope is near the end of its useful life.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Though shuttles will be available during the tram&rsquo;s normal operating hours, with more running during peak times (7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.), please plan to add as much as 30 minutes to your time in transit. If possible, avoid scheduling meetings and appointments on the hill and at the waterfront on the same days.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Shuttles will be accessible to people using wheelchairs or other mobility devices. The tram is normally closed on the Thanksgiving holiday, and the shuttle service will be closed as well.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">The Go By Bike bike parking service will move to the Whitaker lot (just east of the lower tram station, between SW Bond and SW River Parkway) with temporary fencing from Friday, Nov. 18 until Tuesday, Nov. 22. Additional bike parking will also be added on Marquam Hill during this closure.</span></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This November shutdown could be seen as a trial run for much more intense work happening in Spring-Summer 2018. During that time, the tram will be down for five&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;for a required maintenance service, known as track rope slipping.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Track rope slipping is a labor intensive project that normally takes up to eight weeks, but tram operations staff are committed to completing it in five weeks. With two dozen crew members working up to 14 hours a day, this will be their biggest project yet.</p>

News,619055,News Blog: Safe speeds are key to Portland's Vision Zero strategy,1,,2016-11-23 21:05:28 UTC,2016-11-18 21:01:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p""><em>By Matt Ferris-Smith, Portland Bureau of Transportation</em></p>
<p class=""content-right""><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1097123/1110201/vision-zero-logo_crop.png"" alt=""vision zero logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""112"" height=""112"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>(Nov. 18, 2016)&nbsp;Small changes in motor vehicle speed have a big impact on safety for street users.</p>
<p>In a crash, a person walking is eight times more likely to die when hit at 40 miles per hour compared to 20 mph.</p>
<p>The close relationship between speed and safety explains why Portland&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://plan.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">draft Vision Zero Action Plan</a>&nbsp;makes speed one of the four primary focus areas, joining impairment, dangerous behaviors and street design.&nbsp;Unsafe speeds contributed to 47 percent of deadly crashes in Portland from 2005 through 2014.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An average trip in Portland is less than four miles,&rdquo; says Clay Veka, Vision Zero Project Manager at PBOT. &ldquo;High speeds may shave just a few minutes off of trip time, while greatly increasing the chance of seriously injuring or killing someone in the event of a crash.&rdquo;<img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1097081/1110202/death-due-to-speed-slide_crop.png"" alt=""Death due to speed"" width=""591"" height=""272"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland&rsquo;s draft Vision Zero Action Plan, heading to Portland City Council on December 1, has&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71737?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">three actions to support safe speeds</a>, including adding more&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70763?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">speed safety cameras&nbsp;</a>on High Crash Network streets, gaining local authority to set speeds, and using street design to align posted speeds with actual travel speeds.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Veka says that the goal is to create streets that help all people reach their destination safely, regardless of how they choose to travel. &ldquo;As we travel on Portland streets, let's look out for each other and chose safe speeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>First speed safety cameras show results</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Speeds are safer on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway following installation of speed safety cameras in August.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The automated cameras photograph people driving over the speed limit. After police review, the City issues citations based on these photographs. The new cameras have resulted in a 91 percent reduction in top-end speeders&mdash;people traveling more than 50 miles per hour in the 40 mph zone (see table). Overall speeding is down by 60 percent at SW 39th Ave. near the location of the cameras. Safer speeds extend at least four blocks west for eastbound drivers.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1102929/1115619/speeding-on-bhh_crop.jpg"" alt=""BHH speeds before and after cameras"" width=""578"" height=""98"" /></p>
<div><span class=""gd_p"">Speeding on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway before and after speed safety camera installation.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">Over the next year, PBOT will install speed safety cameras on 122nd Avenue, outer SE Division and Marine Drive, all of which are part of the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71734?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">High Crash Network</a>.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Posted speeds getting safer across Portland</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to enforcing existing speed limits, PBOT looks for opportunities to make posted speeds safer.<img class=""govd_template_image content-center"" style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1097108/1115620/recent-speed-changes-in-portland_crop.jpg"" alt=""recent speed changes in Portland"" width=""473"" height=""198"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">PBOT frequently requests&mdash;and receives&mdash;permission from the Oregon Department of Transportation to lower speeds on street segments (see table). The process is time consuming, however, and speed reduction is based on existing motor vehicle travel speeds rather than recommended safe speeds for all street users.</span>Under Oregon law, the state controls speed limits on all streets, including those in Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">A&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/594740?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">new process</a>, approved by ODOT in October, will help PBOT accelerate changes to speed limits while placing greater weight on the safety of people traveling by all modes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This new method will help us deliver on the promise of Vision Zero,&rdquo; says Dana Dickman, PBOT's Safety Section Manager. &ldquo;Changing posted speeds, in combination with street design improvements, education and enforcement, makes streets safer for everyone.&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 21, 2016) As the bureau responsible for our streets, sidewalks and other transportation assets, we are dedicated to building and managing infrastructure that not only makes it easier and safer for Portlanders to get from place to place, but that also increases the quality of life in our communities.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Today, the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Bureau of Transportation</a>&nbsp;was proud to join community leaders from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.divisionmidway.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Division Midway Alliance (DMA)</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://eastportlandactionplan.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">East Portland Action Plan</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pdc.us/welcome.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Development Commission (PDC)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://racc.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Regional Arts and Culture Council</a>&nbsp;on SE 122nd Avenue and Division Street to celebrate a new community beautification project called Art on the Box: Portland&rsquo;s first public art project on a traffic signal box.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1105104/1117520/img-0291_crop.jpg"" alt=""Leah Treat and Yuliya Kostina"" hspace=""7"" width=""283"" height=""358"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;These signal boxes are a critical part of our transportation infrastructure,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Now, thanks to the dedication of the community and the creativity of the artists, it has become a canvas for art. While this is our first Art of the Box project, we hope it won&rsquo;t be the last. We look forward to working with other communities to replicate this success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland needs a lot of art. It&rsquo;s always busy, always moving. It&rsquo;s good to see colors instead of just the plain colors of buildings,&rdquo; said artist Donald Thille, 19, who graduated from Fir Ridge alternative school in 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love art and I love Portland. I want people to see this and find a little bit of Portland in it and be able to relate,&rdquo; said artist Yuliya Kostina, 18, a Russian immigrant and aspiring tattoo artist who graduated from Fir Ridge alternative school in 2016. &ldquo;I think it will influence other artists to speak up and say &lsquo;I want to put my art out in Portland. I love this city and I want to show them what it's about.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;As part of the visioning process for the Division-Midway business district, the DMA heard from community members that they wanted public art to be a part of the process,&rdquo; explained Lisa Boisen, Executive Director of the Division Midway Alliance. With cost often being a barrier to installing public art, DMA explored low-cost public art options. Their research led them to the Art on the Box concept, which has been used in other cities, including Miami and Boise, as a low-cost public art project and as a way to deter graffiti.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After approval by the DMA board, the project was led by Kem Marks, the DMA&rsquo;s Americorps volunteer. He worked with PBOT and the Regional Arts and Culture Council to shepherd the project through the city processes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">DMA partnered with Morpheus Youth Project, a local nonprofit that connects at risk youth to art, and won a grant from the East Portland Action Plan to pay for a portion of the project. The remaining costs for the project came from the PDC. &nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/619057
News,619058,News Release: Don't get towed when Leaf Day pickup comes to NW Portland next week!,1,,2016-11-28 19:42:22 UTC,2016-11-22 21:17:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 22, 2016) &ndash; ""Don't get towed!"" is the Portland Bureau of Transportation's message this week, as we approach the annual start of Leaf Day pickup in Northwest Portland on Monday Nov. 28, when crews will call in tow trucks to remove vehicles for Leaf Day service.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT's Leaf Day program posts ""no parking"" signs 48 hours in advance of Leaf Day service in areas where neighborhood leaders have asked us to remove vehicles to provide an effective leaf pickup service. Areas include Northwest Portland, Goose Hollow in Southwest Portland and Sullivan's Gulch in Northeast Portland. Anyone who parks a car on the street in those areas -- whether you live, work or shop there -- needs to be on the lookout for ""no parking"" signs. In advance of the Thanksgiving holiday, PBOT will post ""no parking"" signs&nbsp;on Wednesday, Nov. 23&nbsp;in Leaf District NW 4, which will be swept on Monday, Nov. 28.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This year, PBOT is offering text message reminders of Leaf Day service in areas where we tow vehicles.</p>

Photo by Portland Bureau of Transportation.</span></em></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">Here are the scheduled dates for Leaf Day districts where vehicles are towed because of neighborhoods' interest in providing the cleanest sweep possible. Most are in Northwest Portland. To reduce the impact to the public, parking restrictions are limited to two hours, 7 to 9 a.m., in all areas except Sullivan's Gulch, where parking is restricted from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday, Nov. 28: NW 4</li>
<li>Wednesday, Nov. 30: NW 2</li>
<li>Friday, Dec. 2: NW 3</li>
<li>Monday, Dec. 5: NW 7</li>
<li>Wednesday, Dec. 7: NW 9</li>

<li>Monday, Dec. 12: SW 1&nbsp;(Goose Hollow)</li>
<li>Wednesday, Dec. 14: SW 2&nbsp;(Goose Hollow)</li>
<li>Friday, Dec. 16: NW 8&nbsp;</li>
<li>Friday, Dec. 16: NE 14 (Sullivan's Gulch) 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">Any cars on the street during Leaf Day in these neighborhoods will be towed at their owners' expense.&nbsp;The current contractual cost of a tow is $168. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.&nbsp;To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044.</p>
<h3>Browse our interactive map to locate your Leaf District's boundaries and service dates</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Click on a Leaf District to see details of service dates and district boundaries. District numbers that say ""clean sweep"" on the pop up details are areas where we call tow trucks if you are parked on a block where ""no parking"" signs are posted. For example, NW 3 is labeled&nbsp;Northwest 3 (Inner West Clean Sweep).</p>

<h3><strong>Live or work in a Leaf District?</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Check your Leaf Day brochure for more details</strong></h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Each year, PBOT sends Leaf Day brochures to thousands of addresses in leaf districts. Those brochures include maps and information about towing in areas where we call for towing to get the most effective sweep possible.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">From mid-November to mid-December, removing leaves from our streets is critical because letting them stay&nbsp;on the street can clog storm drains, flood intersections&nbsp;and make streets slippery. Our Leaf Day Pickup program is about getting the leaves cleaned up in a way that makes a better, healthier and safer Portland.</p>

<p>(Nov. 29, 2016)&nbsp;Bright orange yard signs are blossoming on Portland streets. The signs, free to borrow from PBOT, reflect a shared desire for people to drive safely in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are requesting these signs because they feel unsafe on their street,&rdquo; says Donna Herron, interim chair of the SWNI Public Safety Committee, who has helped distribute at least 40 yard signs in the last year.</p>
<p>Herron says the demand is a result of people &ldquo;driving like crazy,&rdquo; including texting, speeding and rolling through stop signs.</p>

News,619459,News Release: Traffic volumes significantly reduced on SE Clinton Street following safety and design improvements by the Portland Bureau of Transportation,1,,2016-11-30 20:41:21 UTC,2016-11-30 20:37:00 UTC,A,,"<h2>PBOT releases findings of SE Clinton Neighborhood Greenway Enhancement Project</h2>
<h2>Will make diverter at SE 32nd Avenue and SE Clinton Street permanent as part of City&rsquo;s Vision Zero initiative</h2>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1097123/1126258/vision-zero-logo_crop.png"" alt=""vision zero logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""139"" height=""139"" align=""right"" />(Nov. 30, 2016)&nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) released its findings today after six months of testing and observation of design improvements on the SE Clinton Neighborhood Greenway. Citing traffic count data, PBOT declared the project a success saying that safety conditions have improved significantly thanks to the installation of diverters and speed bumps that have lowered traffic volumes and vehicle speeds along the Greenway. Due to its success, in the coming week PBOT will replace the temporary diverter installed at SE 32nd and Clinton with a new, permanent diverter (weather permitting).</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1116292/1127843/permanent-diverter-at-se-32nd_crop.jpg"" alt=""permanent diverter design"" width=""591"" height=""292"" /></p>
<div><span class=""gd_p"">Illustration of the permanent design for the SE 32nd Ave diverter on SE Clinton Street.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">After holding public meetings with residents in the neighborhood in the fall of 2015 as well as conducting an online survey, the bureau installed two diverters along the greenway - a median diverter at SE 17th Avenue and a temporary semi-diverter at SE 32nd Avenue - in January 2016. PBOT also restriped SE 34th Avenue between SE Clinton and SE Division Streets to a one-way northbound with a contraflow southbound bike lane to improve safety. Testing was done on these improvements after a period of six months, to allow for traffic conditions to adjust to the changes. Volume and speed traffic counts were collected in May and June of 2016 at 35 different locations within the project area which stretched from SE 12th Avenue to Cesar Chavez Boulevard.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Before the test, all six monitoring locations within the test area were either near or above 2,000 cars a day, the maximum performance guideline for total auto volumes on a neighborhood greenway as defined in the City&rsquo;s Neighborhood Greenways Assessment Report which was adopted by City Council in 2015. Traffic count results following the six month test period found that auto volumes on SE Clinton were reduced significantly across the entire test area, with reductions in volume between 900 and 1400 cars per day (-34% to -75%) thanks to the design improvements. The street segment between SE 21st and SE 26th Avenue that still exceeds the 2,000 car per day threshold is slated to get additional speed bumps in 2017 as part of an upcoming paving project.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/11/1116336/1127844/greenway-signs_crop.jpg"" alt=""greenway signs"" width=""466"" height=""470"" /></p>
<div><span class=""gd_p"">Four lawn sign messages were developed to raise awareness of SE Clinton Street&rsquo;s classification as a neighborhood greenway, and the how greenways are supposed function.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Neighborhood Greenways are the backbone of Portland&rsquo;s bike infrastructure and the SE Clinton Neighborhood Greenway is one of the oldest and most used of them all. If people don&rsquo;t feel safe using our Greenways, they won&rsquo;t use them,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick. &ldquo;I am proud that we were able to find a cost-effective solution to improve the traffic conditions on SE Clinton and maintain its status as one of Portland&rsquo;s most popular and loved Neighborhood Greenways for people walking and biking.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The results of this project show that small improvements can have big safety impacts,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Thanks to the strong neighborhood support for this project, we were able to achieve the results we were hoping for in a short period of time. I look forward to continuing to build strong community relationships across the city as we implement additional safety improvements to help us reach Vision Zero.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to diverter installation and restriping of SE 34th Avenue, speed bumps were added on SE Clinton between SE Cesar Chavez Boulevard and SE 50th Avenue, new &lsquo;Bikes May Use Full Lane&rsquo; signage was installed and the speed limit on Clinton was reduced to 20 mph where auto volumes are below 2,000 cars per day. The total project cost was $215,000. Installation of the permanent diverter at SE 32nd Avenue will cost an additional $15,000.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland has joined cities around the country in embracing Vision Zero &ndash; the notion that the death of even one person on our roads is one too many.

News,619701,News Release: End of an era as Portland's last single space parking meter is retired,1,,2016-12-02 21:19:42 UTC,2016-12-01 17:58:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/12/1118247/1129593/img-4817_crop.jpg"" alt=""the last parking meter"" width=""591"" height=""394"" /></p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(December 1, 2016) Commissioner Steve Novick, community stakeholders and PBOT representatives officially closed an era in Portland parking history today as they retired the city's last remaining single space parking meter.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Officials retired the meter in dramatic fashion, using an electric saw to separate the meter head from its post. Commissioner Steve Novick then presented the meter to Kerry Tymchuk, Executive Director of the Oregon Historical Society, for inclusion in the society's collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""These meters have served the city well,"" said Commissioner Novick. ""They have been an integral part of our parking management system. But they have reached the end of their useful life, and it is time to completely transition to 21st Century parking technology, like paystations and pay by phone, which are more efficient and make it easier and more convenient for Portlanders to park.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""We are very excited that the Portland Bureau of Transportation&nbsp;has implemented new technologies to manage transportation and parking demand in the Central City,"" said Felicia Williams, President of the Downtown Neighborhood Association. ""These advanced&nbsp;systems make it easier for everyone to enjoy visiting downtown, especially now that people don't have to carry around spare change to feed the meters.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""The retirement of single-space meters is a signal that Portland is moving towards more effective, efficient, and flexible on-street parking management solutions,"" said Tony Jordan of Portlanders for Parking Reform. ""By leveraging advances in plate-reading technology and mobile communications Portland can develop and implement a revolutionary citywide performance based parking solution that will provide greater convenience for consumers who drive while supporting our city's mode share, climate action, and traffic safety goals.""&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland installed its first single-space parking meter in 1938. At the time, an hour of parking cost a nickel. At the height of the meter era, Portland had over 7,000 single space meters in Downtown and other parts of the city. In 2002, Portland become one of the first cities in the country to adopt the next generation of parking technology when it began to install paystations. The paystations allow&nbsp;customers to use credit cards or coins to pay for parking at any space on a block.&nbsp;Since then, PBOT has been gradually replacing single space parking meters with paystations. In the past year, PBOT has been removing the last 453 single-space meters.&nbsp;The meters, which do not take credit cards, have become obsolete and replacing them with paystations is more cost effective, promotes better parking management and provides a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The removal of single space meters is part of PBOT's overall effort to modernize the tools the agency uses to manage on-street parking spaces. In the first half of 2017, the agency expects to introduce two new parking solutions: mobile pay and pay by plate technology. Both tools are expected to make it easier and more convenient for users to pay for parking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(December 2, 2016) Forecasters are still uncertain about the timing and amount of snow we could get in the Portland area on Monday morning, but it never hurts to be prepared! Safety is the Portland Bureau of Transportation's number one priority and, with that in mind, we've prepared some tips to make sure you get home safe in winter weather.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The best advice for traveling in bad winter weather is not to travel at all if you can avoid it. Wait until conditions improve before venturing out in winter weather. Allow the snow plows,&nbsp;sanding trucks, and other emergency vehicles&nbsp;to get out ahead of you to treat conditions. Allow yourself extra time to reach your destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Safety tips for driving</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland&rsquo;s Snow and Ice Plan discourages private vehicle use and encourages public transit use instead. But we understand some neighborhoods at high elevation may encounter snow or ice unexpectedly and everyone should be prepared for winter conditions. The Portland Bureau of Transportation offers these tips. See more at:<a href=""/transportation/47307?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/47307</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Chains - your link to safety!</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Buy chains, practice putting them on your car, carry them in your vehicle, and use them. You may need them unexpectedly, especially at areas higher than 500 feet above sea level in Portland. PBOT sometimes requires chains or traction devices on West Burnside and SW Sam Jackson Parkway.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Carry an emergency weather kit</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Have a well-stocked emergency kit in your vehicle to keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, shovel, bag of sand, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, mittens), flashlight, and a cell phone or CB Radio.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Expect slippery sidewalks; clear your own as well</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In a winter storm, the sidewalk in front of your neighbor&rsquo;s house may be the slickest surface you encounter. PBOT applies anti-icer and uses snow plows to clear streets along bus routes, but property owners are responsible for ensuring safe passage on sidewalks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Look out for people on bike or out walking</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for pedestrians and bicyclists who are also trying to get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions. Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image content-right"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/12/1120940/1132106/screen-shot-2016-12-02-at-3-09-04-pm_crop.png"" alt=""winter weather"" hspace=""7"" width=""220"" height=""633"" align=""left"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Watch for black ice</strong></p>
<p>Black ice can occur when roadways are not subjected to direct sunlight in freezing temperatures. It looks ""black"" because it is clear, not frosty. This makes it almost invisible to the naked eye.&nbsp;Black ice commonly forms on roads that wind around lakes and rivers, in tunnels, on overpasses and in highly shaded, rural areas. Be especially careful when driving or riding into shaded areas, on bridges and overpasses, and on infrequently traveled roads. Slow down during your approach.</p>
<p><strong>You are responsible for your vehicle</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm. Any abandoned vehicle is subject to being cited and impounded. To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044. &nbsp;If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Any vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to towing. The current contractual cost of a tow is $168. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.</p>
<p>Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets. If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives. While you wait for help to arrive, open a window slightly for ventilation, run your motor sparingly, and use your emergency flashers.</p>
<p><strong>You may be towed on West Burnside and Sam Jackson Parkway</strong></p>
<p>PBOT sets up chain-up areas in the shoulder heading uphill on West Burnside and SW Sam Jackson Parkway. They are set aside as a safe place for people to attach snow chains during a storm. Parking is not allowed in these areas and vehicles abandoned there are subject to towing.</p>
<p><strong>Recover your vehicle as soon as possible</strong></p>
<p>Parking regulations and other road safety regulations remain enforceable during a winter storm. If you leave your vehicle parked in a metered parking space or other time zone during a winter storm, recover your vehicle as soon as possible when conditions improve. If you receive a citation, follow the instructions on the back of it to resolve it or contest it with the County Circuit Court.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">People abandoned their cars on West Burnside during a snow storm in 2014. Most of these vehicles were towed to provide a safe chain-up area for drivers heading into the hills on West Burnside. (Photo by Dylan Rivera, Portland Bureau of Transportation.)</span></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Drive safely on wet and icy roads</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Travel gently - drive, turn, and brake slowly.&nbsp;Adjust your speed to the road conditions and leave yourself plenty of room to stop. You should allow at least three times more space than usual between you and the car in front of you.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you get stuck in snow, do not spin your wheels. This will only dig you in deeper. Use a shovel to clear snow away from the wheels and the underside of the car. Pour sand, kitty litter, gravel, or de-icing granules in the path of the wheels to help get traction. Shift from forward to reverse, and back again. Each time you're in gear, give a light touch on the gas until the vehicle gets going.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Turn on your lights to increase your visibility to other travelers.&nbsp;Keep your lights and windshield clean.&nbsp;Don't use cruise control or overdrive on icy roads.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Do not&nbsp;pass snow plows and sanding trucks. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Biking in snow</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Stay warm and dry. For more visibility, wear bright clothing, an orange vest, or use reflective tape. Use front and rear bicycle lights. Lights are required by law when riding after dark - a white light visible at least 500 feet to the front, and a red light or reflector visible at least 600 feet to the rear. Brake early and often. Avoid some painted and steel road surfaces. Steel plates, sewer covers, grates and other metal can be very slick in the rain and snow. Stay out of puddles and off of black ice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Slow down, give yourself longer stopping distances, and keep a firmer grip on your handlebars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Do not pass snow plows and sanding trucks. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Remember, bicyclists have the right to take a full lane and/or use sidewalks which may be used if bike lanes are blocked by snow from snow plows.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Take transit</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City&rsquo;s Snow and Ice Plan discourages private vehicle use and encourages mass transit use instead. In most Portland neighborhoods, residents are within four to six blocks of a transit stop or covered bus shelter. Some neighborhoods have great access to MAX light rail or the Portland Streetcar. To plan your commute by public transit, call 503-238-RIDE (7433) or visit&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.trimet.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.TriMet.org</a>&nbsp;for bus and MAX light rail schedules. In snow and ice, plan for bus delays of 20 to 30 minutes. Know where your transit stops are before venturing out.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/619821

<p class=""gd_p""><br class=""shift"" />(3:50 p.m., Tuesday, Dec. 13, 2016)&nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for severe winter weather that may create hazardous traveling conditions during the Wednesday evening rush hour.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The National Weather Service has advised the City of Portland to expect 1 inch to 2 inches of snow over a six-to-eight-hour period, starting around noon to 1 p.m. While neighborhoods at elevations above 500 feet often experience more snow and ice accumulation than the rest of Portland, forecasters say the snow accumulations could vary widely at low elevations across the metropolitan area. Some low-elevation sites may have more snow than high-elevation areas, because forecasters expect narrow bands of heavy snow to move across the region throughout the afternoon and early evening.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">There is some uncertainty in the forecast. There is a 20 percent or less chance that the Portland area sees less than 1 inch or more than 3 inches of snow, the Weather Service says. The Wednesday afternoon forecast also could change by Wednesday morning.</p>

<ul>
<li>NW Cornell Road is expected to remain closed through the upcoming storm and freezing conditions, staying closed potentially through the weekend. Trees remain in the landslide area, and heavy equipment creates risk for pedestrians who violate the work zone. The site still lacks electricity for street lights and lighting in the tunnel. Damage to power lines and telecommunication infrastructure needs to be repaired. No through traffic is allowed, and only local access is allowed on Cornell east of NW Thompson and west of NW Westover.</li>
<li>PBOT dispatch received 687 phone calls and created 426 service requests, nearly all for downed trees, from 6:30 a.m. Thursday,&nbsp;Dec. 8 through 6 a.m. on Saturday Dec. 10, according to figures the bureau is releasing today.<br class=""shift"" /><br class=""shift"" /></li>

<h1><strong>Advice for the public:<br class=""shift"" /></strong>Be prepared, expect conditions to vary</h1>
<p class=""gd_p"">While the snow forecast may still be uncertain, it never hurts to be prepared!</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The best advice for traveling in bad winter weather is not to travel at all if you can avoid it. Wait until conditions improve before venturing out in winter weather. Allow the snow plows,&nbsp;sanding trucks, and other emergency vehicles&nbsp;to get out ahead of you to treat conditions. Allow yourself extra time to reach your destination.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland&rsquo;s Snow and Ice Plan discourages private vehicle use and encourages public transit use instead.&nbsp;Plan ahead for your public transit commute by calling 503-238-RIDE (7433), visiting&nbsp;<a href=""https://admin.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/www.trimet.org"">TriMet.org</a>&nbsp;for bus and MAX light rail schedules and alerts or&nbsp;<a href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PortlandStreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for streetcar schedules and alerts. In snow and ice, plan for bus delays of 20 to 30 minutes. Know where your transit stops are before venturing out.PBOT provides tips for winter travel for people walking, biking or driving.

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Do not bike, walk or drive in front of a snow plow. Do not pass snow plows or sanding trucks, which are focused on the city's busiest streets. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.</strong></p>

<h1>PBOT last Thursday-Saturday storm response:<br class=""shift"" />'By the numbers'</h1>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews worked overtime during last week's snow and ice storms. PBOT crews&nbsp;worked mainly on storm response from 6:30 a.m. Thursday,&nbsp;Dec. 8 through 6 a.m. on Saturday Dec. 10.&nbsp;Crews set up trucks with plows, sanders and chains by 3 p.m. on Wednesday, in case the storm came early. Some staff also worked through the weekend and are still working to clear streets of tree debris.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">For Thursday through Saturday, PBOT staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applied 22,000 gallons of anti-icer (MgCl) and 868 cubic yards of sand.</li>
<li>Covered plow routes totaling 1,120 lane miles with a separate 260 lane miles of anti-icing. Each route was plowed or anti-iced many times by various trucks.</li>
<li>Handled 687 phone calls and created 426 service requests, nearly all for downed trees. PBOT Dispatch at 503-823-1700 handles all after-hours and weekend calls for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation's Urban Forestry Division.</li>
<li>As of Monday, most of the 260 &ldquo;tree down&rdquo; locations still have debris in place and PBOT is coordinating with Parks to assist them in tree debris removal.</li>
<li>Used at least $16,000 in materials. Labor costs are still being tallied.</li>
<li>Work continues to clear the landslide on NW Cornell as quickly and safely as possible.</li>

<h1>Winter travel safety tips</h1>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Carry an emergency weather kit</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Have a well-stocked emergency kit in your vehicle to keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, shovel, bag of sand, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, mittens), flashlight, and a cell phone or CB Radio.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Expect slippery sidewalks; clear your own as well</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In a winter storm, the sidewalk in front of your neighbor&rsquo;s house may be the slickest surface you encounter. PBOT applies anti-icer and uses snow plows to clear streets along bus routes, but property owners are responsible for ensuring safe passage on sidewalks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Look out for people on bike or out walking</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for pedestrians and bicyclists who are also trying to get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions. Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>You are responsible for your vehicle</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm. Any abandoned vehicle is subject to being cited and impounded. To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044. &nbsp;If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Any vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to towing. The citation for ""preventing free passage"" is $80 and the current contractual cost of a tow is $168, so motorists can expect to pay at least $248. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets. If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives. While you wait for help to arrive, open a window slightly for ventilation, run your motor sparingly, and use your emergency flashers.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>You may be towed on West Burnside and Sam Jackson Parkway</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT sets up chain-up areas in the shoulder heading uphill on West Burnside and SW Sam Jackson Parkway. They are set aside as a safe place for people to attach snow chains during a storm. Parking is not allowed in these areas and vehicles abandoned there are subject to towing.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Recover your vehicle as soon as possible</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Parking regulations and other road safety regulations remain enforceable during a winter storm. If you leave your vehicle parked in a metered parking space or other time zone during a winter storm, recover your vehicle as soon as possible when conditions improve. If you receive a citation, follow the instructions on the back of it to resolve it or contest it with the County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>PBOT is prepared, with crews working in tough conditions</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews applied 8,100 gallons of anti-icer on Monday night, and expect to apply more to try to prevent snow or ice accumulation. Leaf Day service will be provided as scheduled Wednesday morning, for as long as conditions allow. The city's fleet of more than 50 snow plows will be ready by noon. Parking enforcement officers will be in place to tow abandoned vehicles during the evening rush hour.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Plows are not able to move snow accumulations of 1 inch or less, so people who insist on driving should be prepared to drive on snow.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Chains - your link to safety!</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Buy chains, practice putting them on your car, carry them in your vehicle, and use them. You may need them unexpectedly. During snow storms, PBOT often requires chains or traction devices on West Burnside and SW Sam Jackson Parkway.</p>

News,621432,Alert: City of Portland prepares for possible flooding on Johnson Creek,1,,2016-12-21 18:00:16 UTC,2016-12-20 01:05:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gdp"">(Dec. 19, 2016) The potential for heavy rain, combined with melting snow, could cause limited flooding along Johnson Creek between midnight tonight and&nbsp;early afternoon&nbsp;on Tuesday, Dec. 20.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The City of Portland continues to monitor the forecast and flood gauges. While we expect minor street flooding because of heavy rain in the area, we do not expect streets to be flooded by the creek. Flooding could affect some low-lying areas along the creek where homeless individuals camp and some private properties in the area.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Sycamore Gauge on Johnson Creek near 152nd Avenue and Foster Road is at&nbsp;2.59 feet as of 4 p.m. At 11 feet it is considered flood stage, when the creek overtops its banks in some places.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The gauge is expected to reach&nbsp;11 feet at about&nbsp;5 a.m. and crest at&nbsp;11.8 feet&nbsp;by late morning&nbsp;on Tuesday. The flooding threat is expected to be reduced by&nbsp;early afternoon.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The bureaus of Transportation (PBOT), Parks &amp; Recreation, Emergency Management (PBEM), Environmental Services (BES) and the Portland-Multnomah County Joint Office on Homelessness are working together, with support from 211info, to warn residents, businesses and property owners along Johnson Creek that of the potential for flooding overnight.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Today, as a precaution, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation park rangers joined area social service providers to do outreach.&nbsp; Rangers and social service staff contacted people experiencing homelessness - near areas along Johnson Creek that are likely to flood &ndash; and issued warnings about the potential dangers of tonight&rsquo;s rain and possible flooding.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Joint Office of Homeless Services is working with shelter providers to identify available shelter beds for individuals displaced due to the flooding. Individuals seeking additional information about the flooding risk and available shelter should call 211info. (Dial 2-1-1 or visit the website, <a href=""http://www.211info.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.211info.org</a>.)</p>
<h2>Sandbag locations are stocked and ready</h2>
<p class=""gdp"">To help residents and business owners prepare for a flood emergency,&nbsp;sand and sandbags are available at no charge to anyone who wants to use them to protect their property from flood damage. PBOT crews keep the sites stocked with sand and sand bags. No shovels are provided, so the public must bring their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Sandbag locations are:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>SE&nbsp;88th Avenue just south of&nbsp;Holgate Boulevard in the parking lot at Lents Park. Enter parking&nbsp;lot at the bottom of the hill, and follow one-way traffic to the sand pile at the exit on the east side of SE 88th;</li>
<li>SE 111th Avenue and Harold Street at the southeast corner of the intersection; and</li>
<li>SW 42nd&nbsp;Avenue and&nbsp;Vermont Street in&nbsp;the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park; enter Gabriel Park from Vermont.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Restoration projects have reduced severity of flooding</h2>
<p class=""gdp"">To reduce the severity and frequency of flooding along Johnson Creek, the Bureau of Environmental Services is continuing to implement a number of restoration projects along Portland&rsquo;s portion of the 26-mile creek. Most notably, the Foster Floodplain Natural Area, completed in 2012, transformed a flood-prone neighborhood into a natural area that absorbs and filters excess rainwater.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">On Tuesday, Environmental Services field science teams will monitor water levels along the creek and evaluate the performance of restoration areas in absorbing and channeling this event&rsquo;s snowmelt and rainfall. Environmental Services web site offers more information about the <a href=""/bes/32201?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Johnson Creek area</a> and the <a href=""/bes/article/286175?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Foster Floodplain Natural Area</a>.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">In the event that streets are closed, PBOT asks the traveling public to obey all road closed signs. Do not move them or drive around them. The roads have been closed because of hazardous conditions. If drivers ignore the signs, they are potentially putting themselves, other travelers and PBOT crews at risk.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">To report downed trees or street flooding that are causing a hazard and covering a travel lane, call PBOT's maintenance dispatch at 503-823-1700.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Release:</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center"">Commissioner Steve Novick and PBOT celebrate Fixing our Streets milestone; release 2017 project schedule in advance of the start of fuels tax collection</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Dec. 29, 2016)&nbsp;Today, Transportation Commissioner Steve Novick and Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat celebrated the first twenty base repair projects completed as part of the Fixing our Streets program. Commissioner Novick and Director marked the milestone at a recently completed base repair project near the intersection of SE Milwaukie and Romona Streets. At this location, PBOT crews fixed a failing section of street and installed a new concrete bus pad along TriMet bus route 19. Director Treat also released the list of Fixing our Streets street repair and safety projects that are slated to begin in 2017.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Last May, Portland voters decided to pay a higher gas tax in order to fix the streets and make them safer,"" said Commissioner Novick. ""With the 20 base repair projects, PBOT has already started to fix the streets. In 2017, Portlanders will see more streets repaved, dangerous intersections fixed, sidewalks installed, and greenways improved. They&rsquo;ll also see strong emphasis on creating safe routes to schools<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;In short, they&rsquo;ll see their dime in action.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;2017 is going to be an exciting year for the Fixing our Streets program,&rdquo; said Director Treat. &ldquo;After completing 20 small, but significant projects all across Portland this fall, we will now start major paving and safety projects in 2017. We are delivering what voters expected when they passed Measure 26-173: projects that will make their roads better and their city safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Fixing Our Streets program is the result of the passage of Measure 26-173, a ten cent tax on motor vehicle fuels and Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to street repair and traffic safety projects. The collection of the tax is set to begin on January 1, 2017.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Passed on May 17th, 2016, Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years. In May, the Portland City Council also unanimously passed a Heavy Vehicle Use Tax. This separate tax for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds will raise an estimated $10 milllion over four years for the Fixing Our Streets program.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Fixing Our Streets includes paving, base repair, sidewalks, crossings, neighborhood greenways, safe routes to school, high crash corridors, protected bike lanes and alternative street design projects that will all have a significant impact on neighborhoods across Portland. In 2017, PBOT will undertake the following projects:</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>About Base Repair</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Base repair projects are reserved for streets with sections that are in poor or very poor condition. The repairs address those portions of the street that have failed from top to bottom. The goal of these base repair projects is to prevent the structural failure from spreading to other parts of the street. $8.6 million of the Fixing Our Streets funding will go towards base repair projects. The 20 base repair projects completed in 2016 cost a total of $426,000.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The recently completed base repair project at SE Milwaukie and Ramona Streets for Thursday&rsquo;s event is at a bus stop for the #19 TriMet bus. Over time, the asphalt pavement had deformed where the buses stopped. Thanks to Fixing Our Streets, PBOT was able to repair the roadway and install a concrete bus pad. By installing a durable concrete pad, this section of roadway will now be less likely to become damaged by the force and heat generated by braking buses and trucks, thereby making travel safer and more efficient for all road users.</p>

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>About Fixing Our Streets</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On May 17th, 2016, Portland voters passed Measure 26-173, Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to fixing our streets. Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT is investing this money in a wide variety of street improvement and safety projects across the entire city. Fixing Our Streets will help PBOT expand preventive street maintenance that saves money and prevents potholes. It will support our work to make it safer for children to walk to school.

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>About the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In Oregon, Heavy Vehicles (over 26,000 lbs)&nbsp;don&rsquo;t pay gas taxes, they pay a weight-mile tax that is based on their mileage in the state. To make sure that local transportation funding is collected in a way that accounts for freight as well as residential use of the transportation system, the City Council passed a heavy vehicle use tax on May 11, 2016. The heavy vehicle use tax that charges companies based on a percentage of the state weight-mile tax they pay. It is only charged to companies who pay the state weight-mile tax and also have a license to do business in Portland.&nbsp;Businesses will pay 2.8% of their Oregon Weight-Mile tax.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The estimated revenue to be generated from the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax is $2.5 million per year or $10 million over 4 years. Per City Council Ordinance, the funds are to be allocated for 56% street repair and 44% traffic safety.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/622454

<p class=""gd_p"">(Dec. 30, 2016) Portland&rsquo;s Transportation Director Leah Treat, Fire &amp; Rescue Chief Mike Meyers and Police Captain Michael Crebs gathered at Fire Station #7 on SE 122nd Avenue today for a look ahead to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero</a>&nbsp;actions taking place in Portland in 2017 and to remind the public to travel safely this upcoming holiday weekend.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Director Leah Treat shared a list of safety projects on<a href=""/transportation/54892?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;the city&rsquo;s&nbsp;High Crash Network</a>&nbsp;streets and intersections that will go to construction 2017 as part of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action Plan. &ldquo;Our partnership with the Fire Bureau and Police Bureau is absolutely paramount to the success of Vision Zero,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland Fire &amp; Rescue Chief Mike Meyers reiterated his bureau&rsquo;s commitment to partnering with PBOT and supporting Vision Zero by using safety messages and education to reduce the likelihood of serious injuries and fatalities on Portland's streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;There is nothing more to the Portland Fire Department than to reduce deaths in general and reduce these traffic deaths,&rdquo; said Chief Meyers.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This weekend, do not drink and drive. If you cause a crash while drinking and driving and someone is seriously injured or killed, you will be going to prison,&rdquo; said Captain Mike Crebs of the Portland Police Bureau. &ldquo;I see the tragedy involved in these crashes. It is devastating to walk to someone&rsquo;s house and let them know their loved one was killed in a crash.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Police Bureau has pledged their continued commitment to partner with PBOT on crosswalk enforcement efforts as well as traffic safety missions, partnering with each of the three police precincts. Additionally, the Police Bureau will continue to proactively message safety information to reduce the likelihood of injuries and fatalities on Portland streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Officials urged the public to make good choices when celebrating the new year this weekend by taking TriMet, a taxi or ride-hailing service or choosing a designated driver for the evening.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Looking ahead to the 2017, the biggest safety improvement will take place on Southeast Foster Road between 50th&nbsp;Avenue and 90th&nbsp;Avenue. The Foster project is a $5.8 million, federally funded project that will add wider sidewalks, safer crossings, street trees and bike lanes to improve safety, especially for people walking, biking and using mobility devices.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Enhanced sidewalks and crossings are nearly complete on<a href=""/transportation/70554?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;East Burnside Street</a>, and will be finished by next summer on<a href=""/transportation/70552?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;122nd&nbsp;Avenue, Southeast Foster Road and Northeast Sandy Boulevard</a>&nbsp;Portland City Council provided $5.6 million in<a href=""/cbo/article/18178?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_Toc44398653"">&nbsp;general funds</a>&nbsp;for the work in 2015. In addition, safety projects are wrapping up on<a href=""http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/REGION1/Pages/82nd-Avenue-Intersection-Safety-Projects.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;82nd&nbsp;Avenue</a>&nbsp;and<a href=""http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/REGION1/Pages/US26CesarChaveztoSandy.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;Southeast Powell Boulevard</a>&nbsp;Both projects include additional lighting, updated curb ramps and signals, and enhanced crossings. ODOT is planning<a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/REGION1/pages/projectpage.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#US26"">&nbsp;two additional safety projects</a>&nbsp;for Powell Boulevard that will be constructed after 2017.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Next year on North/Northeast Marine Drive, PBOT will buffer the existing bike lanes, add missing multiuse path links, improve crossings at key locations and install a new traffic signal at 122nd&nbsp;Avenue. The $1 million project uses a combination of city and federal funds. Marine Drive will also receive speed safety cameras in 2017.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On<a href=""/transportation/article/621551?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;Southeast Division Street</a>, PBOT will install speed safety cameras and speed reader boards, begin filling sidewalk gaps, enhance crosswalks, add lighting and more. PBOT will also coordinate signal timing from 82nd&nbsp;Avenue to city limits to help reduce the risk of serious and deadly crashes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On West Burnside, PBOT will make<a href=""/transportation/article/618152?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;significant safety improvements</a>&nbsp;where 18th&nbsp;Avenue, 19th&nbsp;Avenue and Alder Street meet. PBOT is also<a href=""/transportation/article/618150?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;building a new sidewalk</a>&nbsp;in 2017 along the north side of West Burnside between 24th Avenue and Uptown Terrace. Both projects use $3.6 million in<a href=""/transportation/46210?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;system development charges</a>. In 2018, PBOT will<a href=""/transportation/article/618151?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;install a new traffic signal at West 20th&nbsp;Pl.</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On Southeast Hawthorne Boulevard and 43rd&nbsp;Avenue, PBOT will install new crosswalk signage and markings and a temporary median island in the coming weeks, and will construct a permanent median island in the spring when warmer weather allows. The changes follow a traffic death at this location in 2016.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;program, the result of the passage of Measure 26-173, will also help move forward safety projects across the city. PBOT will spend $200,000 on sidewalk infill along Northeast 102nd&nbsp;Avenue from Sandy Boulevard to Interstate 84, with construction set for 2017. A $330,000 corridor treatment, yet to be scoped, is planned for 2018 along Northeast 102nd Avenue. Both projects are funded through&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Next spring, PBOT will<a href=""/transportation/article/589007?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;construct safety improvements</a>&nbsp;on Southwest Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway from Southwest 30th&nbsp;Avenue to Southwest 39th&nbsp;Avenue, including sidewalks, protected bike lanes, narrowed motor vehicle lanes and additional rapid flashing beacons. PBOT is paying for the $446,000 project through Fixing Our Streets and other funds. Southwest Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy. received speed safety cameras in 2016.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Fixing Our Streets will provide an additional funding for better lighting and enhanced crossings in 2017, including street lighting infill for multimodal safety to provide street lights at up to 25 locations to improve safety for vulnerable street users traveling on Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Network.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Friday, Jan. 6, 2017)&nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for severe winter weather that may create hazardous traveling conditions Saturday and Sunday, potentially also affecting the Monday morning commute.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The National Weather Service has advised the City of Portland to expect 1 inch to 2 inches of snow on Saturday, following by freezing rain that could produce .25 to .6 inches of ice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Freezing rain is snow that melts into water and freezes upon contact with the ground, causing a glaze of ice. This is the worst type of precipitation to drive in since ice offers almost no traction at all. Freezing rain on bare pavement creates an ice rink on the roadway.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Everyone in Portland should prepare today for winter weather to ensure their safety,"" Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman said. ""We encourage everyone to pay close attention to the weather forecast, understanding that conditions can change quickly and vary from place to place within Portland. Delay your travel to avoid the worst conditions and take public transit if you must travel.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">While neighborhoods at elevations at 500 feet above sea level often experience more snow and ice accumulation than the rest of Portland, forecasters say the snow accumulations for this storm could vary widely at low elevations across the metropolitan area. Some low-elevation sites may in fact have more snow than high-elevation areas.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=""content-center"">PBOT announces police enforcement of traction devices requirement for West Burnside Street, Sam Jackson Park Road</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the first time, PBOT will implement a traction devices requirement on two key snow routes where the city has found dozens of abandoned vehicles during past snow and ice storms.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Motorists will be required to have chains or other traction devices in order to drive on West Burnside starting at NW 23rd Avenue and Sam Jackson Park Road starting at SW Terwilliger Blvd. The requirement will be enforced by the Portland Police Bureau and the OHSU Police.<br /><br /></li>
<li>People driving will be required to show they have traction tires on their vehicles. An area where they can apply snow chains will be provided.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Traction tires are studded tires, retractable studded tires or other tires that meet the tire industry definition as suitable for use in severe snow conditions.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The requirement will go into effect when conditions warrant. Electronic message signs will alert drivers at that time.<br /><br /></li>
<li>OHSU will remain open. The Portland Aerial Tram is expected to extend its hours in snow or icy conditions, operating on Saturday night until midnight.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Drivers who ignore this requirement will be subject to a citation by Portland Police in the amount of $160. If drivers abandon their cars in travel lanes, they could be subject to additional fines and costs.<br /><br /><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=623038"" alt=""Saltzman at news conference"" width=""250"" height=""375"" />

<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">While the snow and ice amounts may vary,&nbsp;it never hurts to be prepared!</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The best advice for traveling in bad winter weather is not to travel at all if you can avoid it. Wait until conditions improve before venturing out in winter weather. Allow the snow plows,&nbsp;sanding trucks, and other emergency vehicles&nbsp;to get out ahead of you to treat conditions. Allow yourself extra time to reach your destination.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland&rsquo;s Snow and Ice Plan discourages private vehicle use and encourages public transit use instead.&nbsp;Plan ahead for your public transit commute by calling 503-238-RIDE (7433), visiting&nbsp;<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/www.trimet.org"">TriMet.org</a>&nbsp;for bus and MAX light rail schedules and alerts or&nbsp;<a href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PortlandStreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for streetcar schedules and alerts.

<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=""content-center"">Winter travel safety tips</h2>
<p class=""content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Carry an emergency weather kit</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Have a well-stocked emergency kit in your vehicle to keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, shovel, bag of sand, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, mittens), flashlight, and a cell phone or CB Radio.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Expect slippery sidewalks; clear your own as well</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In a winter storm, the sidewalk in front of your neighbor&rsquo;s house may be the slickest surface you encounter. PBOT applies anti-icer and uses snow plows to clear streets along bus routes, but property owners are responsible for ensuring safe passage on sidewalks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Look out for people on bike or out walking</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for pedestrians and bicyclists who are also trying to get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions. Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>You are responsible for your vehicle</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm. Any abandoned vehicle is subject to being cited and impounded. To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044. &nbsp;If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Any vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to towing. The citation for ""preventing free passage"" is $80 and the current contractual cost of a tow is $168, so motorists can expect to pay at least $248. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets. If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives. While you wait for help to arrive, open a window slightly for ventilation, run your motor sparingly, and use your emergency flashers.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Recover your vehicle as soon as possible</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Parking regulations and other road safety regulations remain enforceable during a winter storm. If you leave your vehicle parked in a metered parking space or other time zone during a winter storm, recover your vehicle as soon as possible when conditions improve. If you receive a citation, follow the instructions on the back of it to resolve it or contest it with the County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Chains - your link to safety!</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Buy chains, practice putting them on your car, carry them in your vehicle, and use them. You may need them unexpectedly!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Do not bike, walk or drive in front of a snow plow. Do not pass snow plows or sanding trucks, which are focused on the city's busiest streets. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.</strong></p>

News,623820,"Winter Weather Travel Advisory: PBOT urges public to use caution this weekend, releases initial impressions of road salt test, stats from three days of severe conditions",1,,2017-01-17 01:47:12 UTC,2017-01-14 00:42:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;<img style=""width: 720px; height: 150px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=623822"" alt=""Get Home Safe Banner"" width=""250"" height=""45"" /></p>
<p>(Jan. 13, 2016) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public to expect continued challenging travel conditions this weekend. The National Weather Service has also warned the City of Portland to expect the possibility of severe flooding in the Johnson Creek area by&nbsp;the afternoon hours of&nbsp;Tuesday Jan. 17.</p>
<p>Since the afternoon of Tuesday Jan. 10, PBOT crews have been working 24 hours a day to clear the city&rsquo;s 518 miles of plow routes, which cover critical routes for hospitals, police and other first responders and public transit service. Continued freezing temperatures, including a record low 11 degrees early Friday morning, refroze many streets that had previously thawed. PBOT equipment can only plow down to 1 inch above the street surface. PBOT crews attempt to rough up the surface and apply gravel in critical places to provide traction, but slick areas may linger through the weekend, until temperatures rise and rain clears the streets. People driving or biking are urged to use caution.</p>
<p>Everyone is urged to continue to clear sidewalks adjacent&nbsp;their home or business, as required by city code.</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s plowing has cut the number of road closures by two-thirds and made many roads passable in severe subfreezing conditions. Earlier in the week, the City of Portland had up to 25 road closures. With plowing and continued de-icing, that number was reduced to eight closures by 2 p.m. on Friday.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""; margin: 1em 0px 5px; text-align: left; color: #000000; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">The City&rsquo;s 518 miles of designated plow routes make up about 26 percent of city streets, as measured by the centerline distance from one point to another on a given street. That does not account for the multiple lanes on city streets.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""; margin: 1em 0px 5px; text-align: left; color: #000000; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">PBOT snowplows, service vehicles and deicing trucks make multiple passes on each street to clear snow from all the travel lanes. Including multiple passes on the many lanes on the routes, these vehicles drove more than 6,000 miles in aggregate since Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""; margin: 1em 0px 5px; text-align: left; color: #000000; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">Working in conjunction with the Seattle Department of Transportation crews, PBOT conducted a test of road salt in three locations Thursday afternoon: SW Terwilliger between SW Sam Jackson Park Road and SW Capitol Highway; SW Broadway between West Burnside and Interstate 405; and N Going Street from Interstate, west on the N Lagoon Ave-Dolphin Ave-Channel Ave loop on Swan Island. The Seattle road crews applied road salt in one lane and PBOT crews applied Portland's standard liquid de-icer in the lane to the left of the Seattle crew.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""; margin: 0px 0px 5px; text-align: left; color: #000000; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">In the initial assessment, the effect of the road salt was limited and did not provide significant improvement compared with the bureau&rsquo;s standard de-icer. Since this experiment was limited in both duration and the number of locations, PBOT will continue to look for opportunities to assess alternative treatment options, including road salt, in the future.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""; margin: 1em 0px 5px; text-align: left; color: #000000; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"">PBOT is very grateful to the Seattle Department of Transportation for the opportunity to conduct this test.

<p>(5 p.m., Monday, Jan. 16, 2017) The National Weather Service has issued a freezing rain advisory for the Portland metropolitan area. The current forecast calls for freezing rain to start early Tuesday morning and last at least into Tuesday afternoon. Up to 0.4 inches of ice accumulation is likely. Based on this forecast, the Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to be prepared for severe winter weather that may create hazardous traveling conditions during the Tuesday morning commute.</p>
<p>The Weather Service has also advised that freezing rain is likely to last the longest, with more ice accumulation, in areas East of Interstate 205.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; color: #000000; margin: 15px 0px 5px;"">Drivers should be aware that freezing rain creates treacherous travelling conditions.

<p class=""gdp"">(January 18, 2017) In five and a half short months, the bright orange bikes of BIKETOWN have reduced automobile use, increased access to local businesses and expanded tourism opportunities. Those are some of the key findings of a survey of more than 2,400 people who have used Portland&rsquo;s bike share system since it launched July 19.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The survey, which included one-time users as well as annual members, found 26 percent of Portlanders using BIKETOWN said they used it instead of driving a car and 64 percent said they are biking more.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The survey shows BIKETOWN supports local businesses. Among tourists using BIKETOWN, 71 percent said they rode an orange bike to reach stores or restaurants. Also, 69 percent of local residents using BIKETOWN said they were more likely to patronize a business near the colorful orange stations.</p>
<p class=""gdp""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=624029"" alt=""Survey graphic image of data"" width=""561"" height=""370.525337838"" /></span></p>
<p class=""gdp""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Since the launch of BIKETOWN on July 19, there have been over 160,000 trips taken on the City&rsquo;s bike share system totaling 312,690 miles (the equivalent of 49 round-trip rides from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine).</span></p>
<p class=""gdp"">In 2016, 38,000 people have used BIKETOWN in Portland and 3,000 of them have committed to annual memberships. The average trip length for all users is 1.57 miles and the average trip time is 24 minutes.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;We are thrilled with how quickly BIKETOWN has been embraced by Portlanders and visitors alike,&rdquo; Portland Transportation Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;This survey shows BIKETOWN makes it easy for people to use bikes instead of cars for short trips, reducing congestion, pollution and carbon emissions. We are incredibly proud that this new transportation option has helped increase biking in Portland while at the same time strengthening the local economy and supporting local business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The survey, sent to all BIKETOWN users in November 2016, provided additional insight into the usage and popularity of the service. Among the survey&rsquo;s findings:</p>
<p class=""gdp""><strong>BIKETOWN is delivering on its promise to increase biking and reduce car trips:</strong></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>26% of BIKETOWN trips eliminated car trips (among locals)</li>
</ul>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>64% of resident/commuters surveyed said they&rsquo;re biking more</li>
<li>20% of locals reduced their car ownership or have considered it</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gdp""><strong>BIKETOWN strengthens the local economy and supports local businesses</strong></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>56% of BIKETOWN tourist riders surveyed said that bicycling opportunities were a factor in their decision to visit Portland.</li>
<li>71% of out-of-town BIKETOWN users reported using BIKETOWN to reach shopping or restaurant destinations.</li>
<li>69% of local BIKETOWN users said they were more likely to patronize a business near a BIKETOWN station.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gdp""><strong>BIKETOWN users rated BIKETOWN&rsquo;s system performance highly, rating all aspects of performance good or excellent. </strong></p>
<p class=""gdp"">Said survey respondent and BIKETOWN user Megan Cwiklinski, &ldquo;I ride a bicycle all the time now because of the convenience of BIKETOWN. I use them everyday to and from work and just to get around in the Portland area. BIKETOWN is so easy to use and I love not having to worry about locking and storing my own bike!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;My family moved back to Portland in August of this year after having been out of the country for 6 years. We decided to buy one car when we came back and see if we needed a second,&rdquo; said BIKETOWN user Erik Swanson. &ldquo;I was not aware of BIKETOWN bikes before moving back, but was pleased to find stations both a block from my house and a block from my work. I have been using your bikes every day to get to and from work and to work meetings downtown, and I love it! My family does not need to purchase a second car, and biking through the city is such a nice way to start and end my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The most popular BIKETOWN station is SW Salmon at Waterfront Park, with a total of 12,387 trips starting or ending at the location. BIKETOWN continues to be popular even as rain and snow fall in Portland. During a recent snow event on Wednesday, December 14, five people joined BIKETOWN as new members with single ride passes, presumably as an alternate means of travel during winter weather conditions.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Looking forward, PBOT will continue to enhance its partnership with the Community Cycling Center to provide discounted memberships to Portlanders living on low incomes through its BIKETOWN for ALL program. The Community Cycling Center partners with affordable housing, social service and community organizations to connect those in need with BIKETOWN memberships, including cash membership options for those without a credit or debit card. In 2016, BIKETOWN for All members took 776 trips.</p>
<p class=""gdp""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">In 2017, PBOT hopes to increase both the number of trips and number of people using BIKETOWN. As a new service, BIKETOWN&rsquo;s usage is expected to grow as more people become familiar with this transportation option. Half of respondents said that bringing BIKETOWN to new areas would help them use the service more. PBOT and its partners will continue to review ridership demographics and to look for opportunities to encourage more Portlanders to use the bikes and bring BIKETOWN to new neighborhoods while staying a financially sustainable public service.</span></p>

Travelers should consider U.S. 26 or NW Cornell Road as alternative routes for through traffic. Expect delays on area roads during rush hour and consider public transit. Check trimet.org/alerts for information about public transit schedules and delays. <br /> <br /> Given the size of the slide and its location adjacent to the roadway, and with a house right above the slide, it is important for PBOT engineers to ensure the stability of the hillside in order to protect the safety of the traveling public and city workers. <br /> <br /> Numerous downed trees must be cleared before PBOT engineers have a clear view of the scene and can fully assess what is needed to make the roadway safe for city crews and the public. A 100-foot tall Douglas fir tree adjacent to a home must be removed. Crews from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation urban forestry crews must remove other trees in the slide area. <br /> <br /> Debris was still falling from the slide last night and Thursday morning. <br /> <br /> An estimated at least 75 cubic yards of material must be removed by PBOT crews, potentially taking six to 12 dump truck loads. <br /> <br /> We will provide an update on Friday. <br /> <br /> Avoid the area. Use alternate routes. Obey street closed and detour signage. Use caution and travel slowly on detour routes and area streets. <br /> <br /> Local access for residents only is permitted westbound to NW Uptown Terrace and eastbound to NW Maywood Drive and NW Hermosa Blvd and nearly streets.</p>

At this time, there is no estimate for when the additional westbound travel lane may be reopened.&nbsp;<br /><br />PBOT crews cleared more than 200 cubic yards of fallen soil and vegetation from the area, which had been closed since about 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 18, 2016.&nbsp;<br /><br />Given the size of the slide and its location adjacent to the roadway, and with a house right above the slide, it is important for PBOT engineers to ensure the stability of the hillside in order to protect the safety of the traveling public and city workers.&nbsp;<br /><br />Numerous downed trees were cleared before PBOT engineers could get a clear view of the scene and assess what was needed to make the roadway safe for city crews and the public.&nbsp;<br /><br />A 100-foot tall Douglas fir tree adjacent to a home was removed by a contractor for the homeowner. Crews from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation urban forestry removed other trees in the slide area.&nbsp;<br /><br />(Photos by Portland Bureau of Transportation)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gdp"">(4:35 p.m. Jan. 23, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) advises the traveling public that NW Cornell has been reopened after crews cleared a landslide that was reported on Sunday evening between the Audubon Society of Portland and NW 30th Avenue.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">PBOT engineers and maintenance crews, and tree crews from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation worked to clear the site and make it safe.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">It will take weeks for PBOT maintenance crews to clean up debris and damage to the public right of way after recent snow and ice storms and freezing temperatures. Crews are filling potholes, patching water main breaks, cleaning up landslides and rockslides, removing debris from drainage ditches and sweeping gravel from city streets. Tree crews from Parks &amp; Recreation continue to assess hundreds of tree emergencies and clear debris after several winter storms.</p>
<h2 class=""gdp""><strong>VIDEO:&nbsp;</strong>See a video of a large tree being felled and tumbling down the NW Cornell landslide at PBOT's YouTube channel:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;v=TtPA-sb_giQ"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtPA-sb_giQ</a></h2>

<p class=""gdp"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp""><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">The NW Cornell landslide undercut several large trees in the area, so foresters were called in to remove those trees to prevent them from causing a safety risk for the public.</span></p>
<p class=""gdp"">PBOT crews removed four dump truck loads of branches, dirt and rock from the area, including some debris from a smaller nearby landslide that could have caused drainage problems in rainstorms. During the street closure, PBOT crews also swept gravel that had accumulated after recent storm events.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">There is no update on last week's landslide on West Burnside. That road was reopened on Friday, after it had been closed on Wednesday evening. West Burnside is open for travel with one lane in each direction, down from a normal two lanes westbound and one lane eastbound.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Blog: 10 years after Portland Aerial Tram's debut, Portlanders are still discovering the thrilling ride, breathtaking views</h2>

<p>By Brian Armada</p>
<p>Despite being in Portland for the better part of four years, it is to my shame that I had never taken the Aerial Tram! I had definitely seen it every time that I ventured into the South Waterfront, taking its commuters 500 feet into the air as it traverses 3,300 feet towards OHSU, but never once took it myself.</p>
<p>That was the case until a few weeks ago when I took the aerial commute to OHSU accompanied by Rich Eisenhauer, PBOT&rsquo;s SDC Program and Portland Aerial Tram Manager. Rich explained that the Aerial Tram is one of only two commuter aerial trams in the United States, the other being in New York City&rsquo;s Roosevelt Island. Portland&rsquo;s Tram is owned by the Portland Bureau of Transportation and operated in partnership with OHSU.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/01/1187690/1191787/img-9803_crop.jpg"" alt=""Tram selfie"" hspace=""7"" width=""264"" height=""353"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>I got on the Aerial Tram at the South Waterfront terminal and was surprised by how spacious the Tram itself was &ndash; even with all the people inside, it felt very comfortable. The windows inside are huge and offer amazing views from every angle. The tram started moving slowly and smoothly at first, but gradually increased its speed. As I ascended, the tram itself was very steady and the ride felt like the climb right before a rollercoaster drop. Once I could see the OHSU terminal clearly, I felt the need to pop my ears!</p>
<p>I got off the tram at OHSU and walked over to the observation deck, to take a couple pictures and I could not believe the view. The day was very clear and I was able to see Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens and Mount Tabor, along with downtown Portland and the South Waterfront. At the observation deck there&rsquo;s a plaque that has a picture of Portland from 100 years ago and one of contemporary Portland &ndash; it was stunning to look down at that and see how the city has changed and then look back at the city and see how it is still changing.</p>
<p>The ride down from OHSU to the South Waterfront is much more fun, the Tram accelerates slightly as it descends and the drop at the terminal is a very satisfying payoff. The whole way down I could see Mount Hood right in between the South Waterfront&rsquo;s towering structures. I could definitely get used to this as a daily commute!</p>
<p>I also learned that the Tram carries over 9,000 riders a day and sometimes even more during inclement weather. Rich from PBOT explained that although people may think the Tram is susceptible to snowy conditions &ldquo;these things were made for traversing the alps!&rdquo; and are considerably resilient.</p>
<p>The Tram&rsquo;s 10-year anniversary is coming up and I can certainly see the need to celebrate the service it provides - I&rsquo;m just looking for excuses to take it again!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Release:&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center"">The Portland Tram turns 10! Elected leaders, OHSU officials and community members celebrate the Portland transportation icon's 10th Anniversary</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Jan. 27, 2017) U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer joined Mayor Ted Wheeler, Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman, former U.S. Rep. Darlene Hooley, officials with Oregon Health &amp; Science University and Doppelmayr USA and community members to celebrate the 10th&nbsp;anniversary of the Portland Aerial Tram.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Since it launched Jan. 28, 2007, the tram has been a catalyst for the local economy by enabling the growth of housing and bioscience jobs on a former brownfield site. The tram provides an essential public transit link between OHSU&rsquo;s Marquam Hill and South Waterfront campuses.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The Portland Aerial Tram is the quintessential example of the private and public sector working together to build a vibrant, livable community,&rdquo; Blumenauer said. &ldquo;Thanks to the tram, Portland has added thousands of jobs and created a world-class bioscience education hub with OHSU. The tram has been essential to the transformation of South Waterfront into a vibrant, livable community where people can live without a car because they can walk, bike, or go by streetcar or tram.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Before the tram was opened, the South Waterfront area was a little used industrial area, cut off from the rest of the region by Interstate 5.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The Portland Aerial Tram has become an iconic symbol of our city&rsquo;s long tradition of transportation innovation,&rdquo; Wheeler said. &ldquo;It has made our economy stronger by helping us grow the downtown area and grow the bioscience jobs and talent of the future. This anniversary offers all Portlanders a chance to reflect on what a tremendous accomplishment it was to build the tram and how much it has done for Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Since opening, the tram has provided 16 million trips, with about 9,500 trips a day on an average weekday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The tram has become vital to Portland&rsquo;s transportation system,&rdquo; said Saltzman, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;It has provided millions of trips in the last decade. In the recent snow and ice storms, the tram was the only link in the region&rsquo;s transportation system that did not suffer any service disruptions. In fact, the tram expanded its hours of operation, offering service around the clock, and becoming a true lifeline for people to reach OSHU, the VA and Shriners&rsquo; hospitals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;When I realized that the Gibbs Neighborhood would not have access to the Tram or the bike path or the river, I went to work to find the funds so that we could build a bridge over the 13 lanes of traffic and connect them to their neighbors and public services,&rdquo; said former Congresswoman Darlene Hooley.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The Portland Aerial Tram has been a key component in the development of the South Waterfront and the continued growth of OHSU as a major health and science research university. Since the Tram opened 10 years ago, OHSU has added more than 4,000 jobs and invested more than $1 billion in new buildings in the South Waterfront. Without the rapid and reliable transportation provided by the Tram, OHSU&rsquo;s expansion to the South Waterfront would not have been possible,&rdquo; said Brian Newman, OHSU vice president for campus development and administration.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The dignitaries were joined by dozens of people who use the tram on a daily basis. They gathered at the Center for Health &amp; Healing, the first OHSU medical building in South Waterfront, located next to the lower tram landing.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As part of the celebration, the Portland Aerial Tram will throw a Community Day Celebration on Saturday, January 28th, featuring family activities, historical displays, and presentations on the construction of the Tram and the future of South Waterfront. Members of the public will also be able to participate in guided walks, enjoy expert talks and view special Tram Anniversary memorabilia. The event is free and takes place from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">As the City of Portland continues its work to reach 25% bicycle mode split, have you ever wondered where all the bikes will park? We&rsquo;ve seen the public, blue staple racks along the right-of-way, but what about the office worker &ndash; where do they park their bike for the 8+ hours during the work day; or what about people who live in apartment buildings &ndash; where do they store their bikes every evening?</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is currently in the middle of reviewing and updating the Bicycle Parking code requirements to ensure the provision of adequate, comfortable, accessible and secure bicycle parking for new buildings and major redevelopment throughout Portland. The current text of the Bicycle Parking section of City Code (<a href=""/bps/article/53320?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Chapter 33.266 Parking and Loading</a>) was largely written and adopted in 1996 [there was a significant update in 2004 for short-term bicycle parking; and in 2010 to update the amount of required long-term bicycle parking spaces for multi-family dwellings].</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT has convened a Stakeholder Advisory Committee to help guide the process and address key issues around short and long term bicycle parking in new buildings. While the committee is grappling with a number of key issues, one of the current focus areas is on apartment/ multi-family dwelling bicycle parking, and specifically how and where to provide long-term, secure bicycle parking for residents.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">We have developed an&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/apartmentbikeparking?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">online community survey regarding apartment bicycle parking</a>, because, at this time, the Stakeholder Advisory Committee doesn&rsquo;t feel that it has enough user input on this topic. The survey addresses questions regarding the types of bicycles people own, where they are able to park their bicycle (long-term, secure), and their personal preferences for bicycle parking. A popular statement is that, &ldquo;Portlanders love their bicycles so much that they want to sleep with them as close by as possible.&rdquo; While there might be some truth to that statement, we want to hear from users about their issues with bike parking and where they would prefer to store their bicycles.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Please weigh in on the bicycle parking and rack usability of your apartment by taking our survey here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/apartmentbikeparking?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/apartmentbikeparking</a></strong></p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Release: Saltzman expands Portland&rsquo;s winter storm strategy with 100 tons of road salt, expanded PBOT plow routes, more resources</h2>
<p class=""gd_p content-left"">(Feb. 1, 2017) Commissioner Dan Saltzman today announced a broad strategy to boost the City of Portland&rsquo;s winter weather response, including increasing the use of road salt and expanding the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s plow routes to include more school bus routes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p content-left"">&ldquo;I share the frustration Portlanders have expressed over recent snowfalls that lingered for far too long,&rdquo; said Saltzman, the commissioner who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;PBOT crews performed admirably during the several storms that covered the city with an exceptional snowfall and record low temperatures. But when slick roads lingered for a week, businesses lost sales and children missed time in class. We need a broader strategy to address winter storms, starting this week and continuing into next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The strategy announced today will help increase Portland&rsquo;s ability to clear snow and ice, starting with preparation for a storm that is forecast for Thursday evening. The National Weather Service has told the City of Portland to expect as much as 1 to 2 inches of snow on Thursday evening, potentially during the evening rush hour, followed by 0.10 to 0.30 inches of freezing rain overnight continuing into Friday morning&rsquo;s peak commute hours. Thawing is not likely until Friday afternoon or evening.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The storm may bring between a trace and 1 inch of snow to low elevations such as downtown Portland. Conditions are expected to be worse and linger longer, east of Interstate 205, where Columbia River Gorge winds bring colder temperatures. Drivers should be aware that freezing rain creates treacherous travelling conditions. If freezing rain occurs, travelers should avoid all travel unless absolutely necessary and continue to monitor conditions throughout the day. The public is advised to prepare to adjust travel plans, delaying travel or taking public transit if necessary. If using transit, plan extra time and expect delays as trains and buses will likely not be on schedule. Check<a href=""http://trimet.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#alerts/"">&nbsp;trimet.org/alerts</a>&nbsp;before you head out. Monitor weather forecasts closely through the weekend and adjust plans as warranted.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The strategy also includes several elements that will be in place, pending City Council budget approval, in time for winter 2017-18.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This has been an exceptional winter,&rdquo; Saltzman said. &ldquo;While we can&rsquo;t keep winter weather from hitting the Portland area, we as a community can do more to provide clearer, safer passage sooner in the aftermath of these winter storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>To address storms this week, PBOT will:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use up to 100 tons of road salt on at least three busy corridors to help clear snow and ice. This is the largest use of road salt in the modern history of Portland. It will also help PBOT test the effectiveness of road salt in a variety of locations that could indicate how it may be more effectively used citywide in the future.</li>
<li>Expand the city&rsquo;s 1,120 lane miles of plow routes to include up to 340 lane miles of additional public school bus routes. This is a 30 percent increase in the number of lane miles covered by PBOT.</li>
<li>Reinstate the requirement for chains or traction tires on West Burnside and SW Sam Jackson Park Road, as conditions warrant. These two routes serving regional hospitals have often been blocked by vehicles that were abandoned when drivers found themselves unprepared for winter conditions. A first-time implementation of this requirement in January resulted in far fewer abandoned vehicles.&nbsp;Drivers who ignore this requirement will be subject to a citation by Portland Police in the amount of $160.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>PBOT is also seeking additional public and private resources to expand the City&rsquo;s winter weather response next winter by:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Negotiating a Mutual Aid Agreement with the Seattle Department of Transportation that would make it easier and faster for the two cities to share resources in response to severe winter weather events.</li>
<li>Seeking information from the private sector about potential plows and other resources the city could hire to address winter storms. A formal Request for Information is being prepared to send to the contracting community, so companies can describe what services they may be able to provide in future storms.</li>
<li>Working with the Portland Water Bureau to see if their planned equipment purchases could include trucks that could accommodate a snow plow attachment, as PBOT dump trucks are equipped currently.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition, PBOT on Tuesday filed a budget request for $2.8 million from the City&rsquo;s General Fund Budget for 2017-18 to expand the bureau&rsquo;s ability to clear roads during winter storms. Pending City Council approval, the $2.8 million would be available in the budget year starting July 1.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>The budget request includes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>$1.2 million in one-time General Fund investment for equipment, including:</p>
<p>- $342,000 for a grader that will allow PBOT crews to clear hard packed snow from the pavement on critical public safety routes. This will provide a different level of service from snow plows, which only plow to about 1 inch above the pavement.</p>
<p>- $50,000 to convert two six yard dump trucks into de-icing vehicles.</p>
<p>- $12,000 for two aerial drones for use in evaluating landslides and floods;</p>
<p>- $45,000 for three covered storage units to store different de-icing materials such as road salt</p>
<p>- $200,000 for eight drop in sanders/salters to expand de-icing and sanding capacity;</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Advice for the public:</strong></h2>
<h2 class=""content-left"">Be prepared, expect conditions to vary</h2>
<p class=""gd_p content-left"">While the snow and ice amounts may vary,&nbsp;it never hurts to be prepared!</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The best advice for traveling in bad winter weather is not to travel at all if you can avoid it. Wait until conditions improve before venturing out in winter weather. Allow the snow plows,&nbsp;sanding trucks, and other emergency vehicles&nbsp;to get out ahead of you to treat conditions. Allow yourself extra time to reach your destination.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland&rsquo;s Snow and Ice Plan discourages private vehicle use and encourages public transit use instead.&nbsp;Plan ahead for your public transit commute by calling 503-238-RIDE (7433), visiting&nbsp;<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/www.trimet.org"">TriMet.org</a>&nbsp;for bus and MAX light rail schedules and alerts or&nbsp;<a href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PortlandStreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for streetcar schedules and alerts.

<h2>Winter travel safety tips</h2>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Carry an emergency weather kit</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Have a well-stocked emergency kit in your vehicle to keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, shovel, bag of sand, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, mittens), flashlight, and a cell phone or CB Radio.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Expect slippery sidewalks; clear your own as well</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In a winter storm, the sidewalk in front of your neighbor&rsquo;s house may be the slickest surface you encounter. PBOT applies anti-icer and uses snow plows to clear streets along bus routes, but property owners are responsible for ensuring safe passage on sidewalks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Look out for people on bike or out walking</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for people walking and bicycling who are also trying to get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions. Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>You are responsible for your vehicle</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you choose to drive, stay with your vehicle in a snow and ice storm. Any abandoned vehicle is subject to being cited and impounded. To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044. &nbsp;If you are driving and visibility and conditions are getting worse rapidly, do not stop in a travel lane. Any vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to towing. The citation for ""preventing free passage"" is $80 and the current contractual cost of a tow is $168, so motorists can expect to pay at least $248. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $25 per day.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Look for an opportunity to pull off the road into a safe parking area and wait for conditions to improve. If you cannot reach your home, move your vehicle off a major street or plow route onto a side street so that plows can completely open up major streets. If you become stuck or stranded in severe weather, stay with your vehicle for warmth and safety until help arrives. While you wait for help to arrive, open a window slightly for ventilation, run your motor sparingly, and use your emergency flashers.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Recover your vehicle as soon as possible</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Parking regulations and other road safety regulations remain enforceable during a winter storm. If you leave your vehicle parked in a metered parking space or other time zone during a winter storm, recover your vehicle as soon as possible when conditions improve. If you receive a citation, follow the instructions on the back of it to resolve it or contest it with the County Circuit Court.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Chains - your link to safety!</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Buy chains, practice putting them on your car, carry them in your vehicle, and use them. You may need them unexpectedly!&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Do not bike, walk or drive in front of a snow plow. Do not pass snow plows or sanding trucks, which are focused on the city's busiest streets. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.</strong></p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Release:</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center"">Sunday Parkways announces 10th&nbsp;Anniversary Season of the popular open streets event. New route in Outer Northeast Portland is debuted.</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Feb. 14, 2017) - The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and presenting sponsor Kaiser Permanente announced the schedule for the tenth season of Sunday Parkways today. The milestone season will include five traffic-free events highlighting five different Portland neighborhoods and will include a new route in the Gateway area of outer northeast Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Since 2007, Portlanders have been able to explore their neighborhoods by walking, biking and rolling thanks to Sunday Parkways,&rdquo; said Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;In every neighborhood and at every event, we discover a new reason to fall in love with our city all over again. But what makes it truly wonderful is that Sunday Parkways is open to everyone. I look forward to celebrating ten years of Sunday Parkways this year with Portlanders of all ages and abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland Sunday Parkways presented by Kaiser Permanente kicks off its tenth year on May 21, 2017 in Southeast Portland. The 10th summer of celebrating Portland&rsquo;s open streets will finish on September 24, 2017 with the Sellwood/Milwaukie event. Portlanders will have the opportunity to officially wish Sunday Parkways a happy tenth birthday at the North Portland Sunday Parkways on June 25, 2017.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Not only is it Valentine&rsquo;s Day, it&rsquo;s American Heart Month so there&rsquo;s no better time to think about ways to improve your heart health,&rdquo; said Ruth Chang, MD, a family practice physician with Kaiser Permanente Northwest. &ldquo;Sunday Parkways offers two great things for your heart &ndash; physical activity, and the chance to spend time with your family and neighbors exploring our beautiful city. My kids, husband, and I will be out there and we hope you will be too!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After nine successful seasons of Sunday Parkways, organizers know that Sunday Parkways participants are incorporating biking and walking into their everyday mobility as a result of the events. All five Sunday Parkways routes showcase low-traffic streets called neighborhood greenways as well as City parks ideal for bicycling and walking. The new Outer Northeast route in August will introduce participants to an often overlooked neighborhood with majestic parks and quiet, livable streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sunday Parkways chose to work with the outer northeast neighborhoods as part of the Gateway to Opportunity program. Thanks to Gateway to Opportunity, this area will see new investments in pedestrian and bike facilities in the next few years. These projects include the 130&rsquo;s neighborhood greenway, the Holladay-Oregon-Pacific (HOP) neighborhood greenway, the Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project and Outer Halsey Streetscape Project among other improvements to make it safer and more comfortable to get around the area. The new Sunday Parkways route will highlight five beautiful parks including Knott, John Luby, Thompson, East Holladay, and Hazelwood Hydro Parks and five different schools.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;We really have something to celebrate this year,&rdquo; said Leah Treat. &ldquo;10 years of Sunday Parkways! 10 years of opening our streets and helping Portlanders discover the joys of walking, biking and rolling through their neighborhoods. Like so many other Portlanders, Sunday Parkways is one of the things I love best about our city. I can&rsquo;t wait to get out there with my family and friends this summer.&rdquo;</p>

News,629948,News Release: PBOT launches Patch-a-thon to address potholes caused by winter storms,1,,2017-02-24 17:25:23 UTC,2017-02-24 17:24:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(Feb. 23, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) has launched Patch-a-thon, a new initiative to fill the numerous potholes caused by this season's many winter storms.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As of Wednesday, PBOT had a backlog of more than 1,000 potholes that have been identified by residents and city crews. During Patch-a-thon, PBOT dedicates extra crews and resources to address the backlog. During normal operations, PBOT has two to three crews repairing potholes. During Patch-a-thon, this number will rise to 12 to 15 crews.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman helped kick off the effort by helping a crew fill a pothole on Thursday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""PBOT crews worked through record snow and low temperatures this winter,"" Saltzman said. ""Those winter storms left us with hundreds of potholes all over the city that residents are rightly concerned about. I encourage Portlanders to report potholes with as much detail as possible. And please be patient as we work through this backlog.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The first two days of Patch-a-thon are Thursday, Feb. 23 and Friday, Feb. 24. In the coming weeks, PBOT will hold a Patch-a-thon on those days when the weather permits effective and safe pothole repair. PBOT will continue Patch-a-thon until the winter pothole backlog has been cleared.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews fill more than 8,000 potholes a year, working throughout the year. The work is weather dependent and crews are sometimes diverted to emergencies such as landslides. Heavy rain can cause potholes to fill with water, making the repairs less durable.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portlanders are encouraged to report potholes by sending a detailed description and photos to PBOT dispatchers by email&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:pdxroads@portlandoregon.gov"">pdxroads@portlandoregon.gov</a>&nbsp;or by using the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/405043?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PDX Reporter App.</a>&nbsp;They can also call 503-823-1700, PBOT's 24 hour maintenance line.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT has also published&nbsp;<a href=""http://arcg.is/2l9qAGt?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">an interactive pothole map</a>, so that Portlanders can track Patch-a-thon's progress. The map shows potholes reported since Dec. 1, 2016, showing the backlog created by winter storms and low temperatures.</p>

<div class=""content-center""><span class=""gd_p"">Starting tomorrow morning, PBOT crews will begin switching out the 35 mph signage on Outer Division to 30 mph signs. Photo by Dylan Rivera, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(March 2, 2017) In a unanimous vote, Portland City Council approved an ordinance that will establish emergency speed limits for portions of Southeast Division Street from SE 82nd Avenue to SE 174th Avenue at the city limits. The new speed on Outer Division will change from 35 to 30 mph.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Under Oregon law, a road authority may establish an emergency speed on any road that is different from the existing speed. In 2016 alone, five people died in traffic crashes on SE Division &ndash; four people walking and one person driving &ndash; and three people sustained life altering injuries. Seven of the collisions occurred on a two-mile stretch between 124th and 156th. For that reason, City Council declared an emergency speed limit on Outer Division.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Starting tomorrow morning, PBOT crews will begin switching out the signage on Outer Division to reflect the new speed of 30 mph. Pursuant to ORS 810.180(9), the new speed of 30 mph will go into effect as soon as all new signs have been posted along the corridor.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The correlation between speed and serious injury or death is clear,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;We must ensure that all streets in our city are safe for people walking, biking, rolling or driving. I am grateful to my colleagues on City Council for understanding and supporting this urgent situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;I deeply appreciate City Council&rsquo;s leadership on the issue of traffic safety on Outer Division and throughout East Portland,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;The need for this action is clear. A person walking struck by a person driving 40 mph is twice as likely to die as a person struck by someone driving at 30 mph. What is more, people walking in East Portland are 2.5 times more likely to be killed in traffic crashes than in the rest of the city. It&rsquo;s time to put aside the desire to get somewhere quickly because doing so can mean the difference between life and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Over 10 years, SE Division has had more crashes that caused fatalities or serious injuries to people driving than any other corridor in the city with a total of 13 deaths and 117 serious injuries. It had the fourth highest total for people walking, and the second highest total for people riding bicycles.&nbsp;Outer SE Division is on the designated High Crash Network due to the high rate of crashes on the street. The traffic deaths and injuries on Outer Division greatly affect the diverse communities in the Jade District, Division Midway Alliance and other communities in East Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The ordinance passed at City Council today was an emergency ordinance. Emergency Ordinances take effect immediately. They must be unanimous and at least four Council members must be present to vote.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The changes are the first step in the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s<a href=""/transportation/article/621551?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;Outer SE Division Near-Term Safety Strategy</a>. The strategy was developed as part of a previous ordinance passed by City Council on December 21st, 2016 in response to the deaths of two pedestrians who were killed in Outer Division traffic crashes within hours of each other on December 7, 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Each step in the plan implements an action identified in Portland&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71730?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero Action Plan</a>&nbsp;while also upholding&nbsp;<a href=""/oehr/68111?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PBOT and the City of Portland&rsquo;s commitment to racial equity</a>. The steps include: increasing multilingual and multi-cultural traffic safety education; decreasing speed through automated enforcement; decreasing speed through speed reader boards; decreasing speed through lowering posted speed; and decreasing speed through street design.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to the speed change, the city has also accelerated the installation of speed safety cameras on SE Division at SE 151st and on SE 122nd at SE Steele and SE Reedway. Safety cameras are proven safety tools that can reduce dangerous speeding and save lives. The cameras are mounted along High Crash Corridors and when people driving past them exceed the posted speed limit, they capture photos and video for review by Portland Police.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The speed safety cameras on SE Division and SE 122nd will be activated on Monday, March 6, 2017. The cameras will issue warnings for the first 30 days. Thereafter, people can avoid citations by traveling the posted speed limit. Any money received from the tickets pays for the program and safety improvements on the corridor.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/630967
News,631566,News Release: Speed Safety Cameras start issuing warnings today on two East Portland high crash corridors,1,,2017-03-07 22:14:41 UTC,2017-03-06 22:12:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""content-left""><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/08/986097/1010291/visionzerologo_crop.png"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""260"" height=""260"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(March 6, 2017) --&nbsp;East Portland's first Speed Safety Cameras are now operational on SE Division Street and SE 122nd Avenue and will begin issuing warnings today to drivers who exceed the posted speed limits on those high crash corridors, the Portland Bureau of Transportation announced.</p>
<p>The goal of the Speed Safety Cameras is to reduce speeding and save lives. Safety cameras along SE 122nd&nbsp;Avenue and SE Division Street in East Portland start issuing warnings today to drivers who exceed the posted 30 mph&nbsp;speed limit along SE Division Street and the 35 mph speed limit along SE 122nd&nbsp;Avenue. The 30-day warning period will end on April 4, with citations starting the following day.</p>
<p>The safety cameras activation on SE Division comes just four days after the Portland City Council unanimously approved an emergency speed reduction from 35 mph to 30 mph that was proposed by Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT.</p>
<p>""Last year, we had more fatal crashes on our streets than we have had in more than a dozen years,"" Saltzman said. ""That&rsquo;s unacceptable, and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way. The emergency speed reduction on SE Division, coupled with these safety cameras and more improvements coming soon, will save lives.""</p>
<p>Transportation Director Leah Treat said the safety cameras are a key initiative in helping Portland reach Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating fatal and serious injury crashes.</p>
<p>""Safer streets for all Portlanders is my number one priority,"" Treat said. ""Since we installed safety cameras on Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, we&nbsp;have seen people begin to change their behavior, which is key to really moving the needle on safety.&nbsp;And when people drive more slowly, our streets get safer.""</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson, Portland Fire Chief Mike Myers and Capt. Michael Crebs, of the Portland Police Traffic Division joined&nbsp;Saltzman and Treat at a news conference today to mark the activation of the cameras.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Cameras are being installed on SE Division sooner than expected, because the Portland City Council passed&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/621551?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">an emergency ordinance in December</a>, calling for PBOT to fast-track safety improvements in the corridor after two fatal crashes there on Dec. 7.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">More than half of deadly crashes occur on just 8 percent of Portland streets. These streets make up the<a href=""/transportation/54892?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;High Crash Network</a>. SE<a href=""/transportation/59289?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;122nd</a>&nbsp;Avenue and SE<a href=""/transportation/59284?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;Division</a>&nbsp;Street in East Portland are among 30 High Crash Network corridors.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The rate of pedestrian crashes on SE 122nd&nbsp;Avenue is about 50 percent higher than the citywide average. &nbsp;Analysis of a decade&rsquo;s worth of crash data found that more Portlanders were seriously injured or killed while driving on SE Division than on any other street.</p>
<h2>Safety cameras cut top-end speeding by more than 90 percent on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway last year</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">Safety cameras have already proven their ability to dramatically reduce speeding in Portland. The first safety cameras in Oregon started issuing tickets on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway on Sept. 24, 2016, after a 30-day warning period.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The warnings&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/591687?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">reduced top-end speeding</a>&nbsp;along the corridor, where about 25,000 vehicles travel each day and the speed limit is 40 mph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the cameras were installed, an average 1,417 vehicles a day traveled 51 mph or faster, according to readings by a pneumatic&nbsp;tube laid across the roadway.</li>
<li>During the warning period from Aug. 24 to Sept. 18, an average 93 vehicles a day were found traveling 51 mph or faster -- a 93.4 percent reduction from the tube count.</li>
<li>In the first week of the warning period, cameras recorded an average 115 violations a day. Violations dropped to an average 72 a day by the week of Sept. 12 to 18.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Safety Cameras are a proven safety tool that can reduce dangerous speeding and save lives. The cameras are mounted along High Crash Corridors and when people driving past them exceed the posted speed limit, they capture photos and video for review by Portland Police. The cameras will issue warnings for the first 30 days of operation, and issue citations starting April 5. An officer from the Portland Police Bureau will review violations before a citation is issued.&nbsp;Penalties are the same as any other speeding violation. The typical speeding citation in Oregon is a Class C violation (11 to 20 mph in excess of the speed limit) resulting in a $160 fine.</p>
<p>By state law, any money received from the tickets can only be spent to pay for the program or for safety improvements.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/03/1246822/1245499/commish-and-team_crop.jpg"" alt=""Saltzman and PBOT sign crew"" width=""590"" height=""443"" /></p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The Speed Safety Cameras program provides ample warning to people driving in the area. State law requires&nbsp;speed signage and speed reader boards to be installed, warning drivers more than 100 yards in advance of the cameras in both directions. PBOT staff also conducted extensive outreach with local neighborhood associations as well as businesses and community organizations to raise awareness of the changes along the corridor, before the cameras were installed. Outreach will continue during the warning period.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to the new cameras, PBOT is delivering additional safety and maintenance projects. For example, PBOT will<a href=""/transportation/article/589856?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;enhance SE 122nd&nbsp;Avenue</a>&nbsp;crossings by installing a rapid flashing beacon with pedestrian island and a crossing with a pedestrian hybrid beacon (also known as the High Intensity Activated crossWalK or HAWK) as well as construct new sidewalk and perform sidewalk repair.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Along SE Division,<a href=""/transportation/article/621551?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;projects</a>&nbsp;include:</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Accelerate the timelines for federally-funded safety projects on outer SE Division, including the East Portland Active Transportation (EPAT) and Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) projects, for construction in 2017. The projects include pedestrian crossings with median islands and Rapid Flashing Beacons or Pedestrian Hybrid Signals to complement sidewalk infill.</li>
<li>Expand the East Portland In Motion (EPIM) buffered bike lane project on outer SE Division St to a multi-modal safety project, with focus in the Jade District and Division Midway Alliance district, that includes additional street lighting, enhanced crossing treatments, and vehicle access management.</li>
<li>Install additional speed reader boards at four locations from SE 82nd to the city limits to educate drivers and reduce speeding.</li>
</ul>

<p class=""gd_p"">The first Speed Safety Cameras in Oregon were installed on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway last fall after the City of Portland and community safety advocates convinced the state Legislature in 2015 to pass HB 2621, which allows them to be used on High Crash Corridors in the Portland city limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The fourth fixed speed safety cameras installation will be on NE Marine Drive later this year.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland has been using other cameras to supplement speed enforcement for years, with police officers in vans enforcing speed limit violations. Portland also uses cameras to increase enforcement of red lights at traffic signals.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>PBOT partners with City, County, State and transit agencies to launch regional construction coordination initiative, Get Portland Moving.</strong></h2>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>Initiative aims to lessen travel impacts of multiple upcoming construction projects in the Central Business District and Cully neighborhood.</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>PBOT will partner with Waze, the free, real-time crowdsourced traffic and navigation app powered by the world&rsquo;s largest community of drivers to provide public with more complete congestion information.</strong></h2>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong><br /></strong><strong>BIKETOWN to offer discounts for first-time riders during major closures</strong></h2>
<p class=""gd_p content-center""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(March 9, 2017) Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation, the Bureau of Environmental Services, the Portland Water Bureau, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Multnomah County, the Oregon Department of Transportation, TriMet, and Portland Streetcar announced&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.movepdx.net/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Get Portland Moving</a>, an ambitious effort to bring a new level of coordination to construction and maintenance projects on the streets of the Central Business District and Cully neighborhood.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Throughout 2017 and into 2018, the Central Business District will be the site of multiple projects to repair and replace aging streets, sewers, rail track beds and machinery, bridge structures and other important community assets throughout downtown.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">While these important improvement projects will result in long-term gains for Portland and the greater region, the work will cause temporary disruptions for residents, businesses, and visitors in the short-term.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To lessen the construction impacts and to work more efficiently, the Get Portland Moving partners have come together to coordinate planned work on city streets, state highways, county bridges and transit lines. The partner agencies are aligning construction schedules to minimize competing demands and to maximize the opportunity to get as much work done in a specific area at the same time, saving time and avoiding the need to disrupt travel multiple times. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">An example of this coordination is the retiming of the Bureau of Environmental Services&rsquo; major sewer repair work along SW Yamhill and SW Morrison streets, Multnomah County&rsquo;s Burnside Bridge project and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s project at the Pioneer Square South MAX Station. All of this work will be aligned with TriMet&rsquo;s planned Morrison-Yamhill MAX Improvements project. This coordination will limit MAX service interruption to a single disruption from Sunday, April 30th through Saturday, May 20th. Members of the public can learn more at&nbsp;<a href=""https://trimet.org/bettertransit/maximprovements.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">trimet.org/maximprovements</a>. Portland Streetcar service will be disrupted during the first two weeks of the project.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In accordance with the City&rsquo;s administrative rule on the&nbsp;safe accommodation of pedestrians and cyclists in and around construction zones, all partners have pledged to make safe access for people walking, biking and rolling a priority.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To provide the travelling public with up-to-date information about construction impacts, PBOT has partnered with Waze, the free, crowdsourced traffic and navigation app that helps users plan their trips. PBOT will share road closure information with Waze to communicate to its more than 175,000 monthly drivers in Portland. Road closures and suggested travel routes, as provided by Waze, will be available on the Waze app (available on smartphones) and online. Road closures, major project details, and additional information about Get Portland Moving can be found at:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.movepdx.net/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.movepdx.net</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To encourage commuters and visitors who are seeking alternatives to driving,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN</a>, Portland&rsquo;s bike share system, will be offering discounts to new riders during major closure events, such as the MAX disruption in downtown Portland in April - May.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This construction season we&rsquo;re going to have to go through some short-term pain for some long-term gain,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;That is why Get Portland Moving is so critical. With eight agencies working together -- a really unprecedented level of coordination -- we minimize the disruptions and maximize the results for Portlanders. I am also very happy to have a private-sector partner like Waze on board to help us get Portlanders information they can use to plan their travels.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;As the steward of our streets, PBOT has a responsibility to ensure that when construction work is done, it is done safely and efficiently. That is why we have spearheaded Get Portland Moving,&rdquo; said Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;I am especially pleased that all of the partners will be prioritizing safe access for people walking, biking and rolling during their projects in support of our regional Vision Zero initiative.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""We will be working on repairs to three downtown bridges this year,"" said Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson. &nbsp;""We're working to minimize inconvenience to commuters by coordinating schedules so lanes will be closed on only two bridges at a time. We are also working with TriMet so that both agencies can complete repairs when the MAX station under the Burnside Bridge is closed this spring.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;By coordinating with TriMet, we will minimize disruption to the public and be able to condense several months of urgent repairs along Yamhill and Morrison streets into just nine weeks this spring,&rdquo; said Environmental Services Director Mike Jordan. &ldquo;Coordination allows us to maximize the amount of critical work we can get done on this corridor. Our investment to repair sewers that were built as long ago as 1880 will improve the reliability of our system in the downtown core, prevent disruptive sewer failures and protect the public, businesses and our environment.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""TriMet thanks our partners for their cooperation and efforts to further reduce the impact to our riders by tackling their projects during our MAX improvements as their work would have otherwise led to separate disruptions,&rdquo; said TriMet Chief Operating Officer Doug Kelsey. ""We also want to thank our customers for their patience as we work to rejuvenate this 30+ year section of the MAX system, especially at SW 11th Avenue, which was originally the end of the community&rsquo;s first ever MAX line. This work is necessary to improve the ride while increasing the resiliency of the system as we work to make MAX - and our entire transit system - better for our customers.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This summer ODOT is widening U.S. 26, constructing safety projects across the region and will be installing more RealTime signs to provide drivers with up to the minute traffic info to choose the most efficient route,&rdquo; said ODOT Region 1 Manger Rian Windsheimer. &ldquo;Visit&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.tripcheck.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">TripCheck.com</a>&nbsp;to review your route and &ldquo;Know Before You GO!&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The Portland Water Bureau is pleased to work alongside our partners to make necessary infrastructure upgrades that will improve our city for the next generation of Portlanders,&rdquo; said Portland Water Bureau Director Mike Stuhr.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The long-awaited restoration of Pioneer Courthouse Square is underway and on schedule,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;More than 70% of Portland voters approved the Parks Replacement Bond which makes the project possible. It is exciting to see the project proceed for the benefit of the 11 million visitors who visit and use the Square each year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Cully neighborhood is also included as part of Get Portland Moving. Critical freight routes are located in Cully and a significant number of pavement restoration and signal and safety improvement projects will be undertaken in the area. By including Cully in the Get Portland Moving effort, partner agencies can improve coordination with neighborhood residents and Portland&rsquo;s freight community.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Based on the results of the Get Portland Moving program in the central city and Cully, PBOT and its partners will plan how to expand this effort citywide in 2018.</p>

News,632853,"PBOT Traffic Advisory: West Burnside to remain closed through at least Tuesday, as landslide risk continues",1,,2017-03-22 01:30:47 UTC,2017-03-17 00:25:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=632854"" alt=""Crack above West Burnside"" width=""654"" height=""364"" /><br /><em>White markers indicate a crack at the top of a landslide widened from about 6 inches wide on Wednesday afternoon (at left) to about a foot wide on Thursday morning (at right). This is an indication of continued risk of additional slides at the site. Photos by Linda Goheen and Shawn Castrapel, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>(5:15 p.m., Thursday, March 16, 2017) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that West Burnside Road is expected to remain closed at least through Tuesday, March 21, as a hillside continues to threaten the roadway with the risk of more landslides. Work to clear the largest slide to affect a Portland street this winter is weather dependent, so the closure may last longer.</p>
<p>PBOT crews were executing a controlled slide of the area on Thursday, removing mud and large root balls piece by piece. PBOT rented an excavator with an extra-long arm, so crews could remove debris from the highest points of the 45-foot tall landslide, while keeping personnel a safe distance away. Foresters from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation removed trees all morning and paused their work as PBOT crews with the excavator removed higher up debris to make the site safe.</p>
<p>""We're trying to pull the material down carefully and slowly,"" Suzanne Kahn, maintenance operations group manager. ""Hopefully it doesn't decide to come down on it's own, like it did Wednesday morning. We don't want to take any more of the hillside down than needs to come down.""</p>
<h2>VIDEO of PBOT<strong></strong> crews using a long excavator to remove rootballs, soil and other debris from the landslide. See <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?edit=vd&amp;v=dD64I7jJdq0"">PBOT's YouTube account</a>.</h2>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=632855"" alt=""Excavator on West Burnside"" width=""250"" height=""186.728395062"" /></p>
<p>The public should stay away from the area until PBOT crews decide to reopen it next week. West Burnside is closed to people biking, walking or driving between NW Skyline Blvd and SW Barnes Road, near the Mount Calvary Cemetery. People driving through the area are encouraged to use U.S. 26 or NW Cornell Road as alternate routes, or consider public transit.</p>
<p>A signed detour guides westbound traffic to use SW Skyline to Barnes Road, then to West Burnside. Eastbound traffic is directed to SW Barnes, then SW Skyline before returning to West Burnside.</p>
<p>A number of factors require an extended road closure as crews deal with the largest landslide of the winter season:<br />&bull; A crack at the top of the slide, about 45 feet above the roadway, widened from about 6 inches to about a foot, from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday morning. The slide area extends about 50 feet from the roadway, and about 120 feet long.<br />&bull; Forecast weekend rain could increase the risk of landslides at the site, increasing the risk to City workers and the public.<br />&bull; Water from the landslide has damaged the roadway. PBOT plans to make road repairs before reopening West Burnside. Permanent fixes, such as permanent pavement, may be scheduled for a later date, depending on weather conditions.<br />&bull; The work is weather dependent, so the schedule may continue to change. Removal of more debris may reveal more risk and a need for more time to remove material.</p>
<p>PBOT crews removed 744 cubic yards of debris on Wednesday, 456 cubic yards on Thursday and expect to remove another 400 cubic yards or more on Friday. With more than 1,000 cubic yards of debris, this is by far the largest of the 42 landslides PBOT crews have responded to this winter. A landslide on SW Skyline Blvd in February displaced more than 600 cubic yards of debris.</p>
<p>PBOT crews using 12-yard dump trucks have hauled scores of loads from the site, and forestry crews have also hauled woody debris.<br />Winter storms and spring rain have taken a toll on hills in the Portland area. PBOT crews have responded to 42 landslides this season, through Wednesday.</p>
<p>The public should stay away from the area. We ask travelers to observe all street closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.</p>
<p>PBOT rented an extra long excavator to remove large rootballs debris piece-by-piece on Thursday, and allow crews to remain a safe distance away.

<p>We look forward to seeing YOU at your high school cluster open house. We need to hear from you how to spend $8 million on safety projects near schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;program, Safe Routes to School is expecting to make a large investment in safety improvements around Portland schools in the next few years. This spring we're asking families to help us figure out what is needed most in your high school cluster.</p>

<p>The Safe Routes to School program is hosting open house events across the city to listen to families about their routes to school and the barriers they face. At the most recent events, families from the Grant and Roosevelt High School clusters talked about speeding drivers, difficult crossings and arrival/dismissal traffic concerns. While at the open house, parents expressed why they walked or rolled...or didn't; what was their number one safety concern; and how far they would go out of their way for a safer crossing. They also drew their routes on school maps and learned just how much it costs to create their perfect intersection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Public Schools was also there to share information about their&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.saferoutespdx.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.SafeRoutesPDX.org</a>&nbsp;web app that lets families share their safety&nbsp; concerns online.

<h3>About Fixing Our Streets</h3>
<p>On May 17th, 2016, Portland voters passed Measure 26-173, Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to fixing our streets. Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years.</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation will invest this money in a wide variety of street improvement and safety projects across the entire city. Fixing Our Streets will help PBOT expand preventive street maintenance that saves money and prevents potholes. It will support our work to make it safer for children to walk to school. It will allow us to build more sidewalks, traffic signals, street lights and bike lanes.</p>
<p>In approving Measure 26-173, voters also voted for a transparent, accountable and efficient program.

<h2 class=""content-center"">PBOT Traffic Advisory:</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center""><strong>West Burnside may reopen at 4 p.m. Friday, after PBOT crews fix landslide damage, sinkholes and pavement</strong></h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">(4 p.m., Tuesday, March 21, 2017) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that West Burnside Road is expected to remain closed at least through Friday afternoon. The soonest the roadway will be reopened is 4 p.m. on Friday, March 24, after crews work to repair and improve the road after a recent landslide.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Crews may reopen Burnside at 4 p.m. Friday, but the work is weather dependent, so the schedule may change and the closure may last longer.</p>
<h2><strong>Sinkhole repairs and pavement improvements</strong></h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">Crews undertaking multiple repairs to improve the condition of West Burnside this week. They are&nbsp;repairing two sinkholes and several potholes. They are improving drainage in areas where stormwater was not draining properly into roadside storm drains.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition, there&nbsp;are several places where the base underneath the pavement has been compromised and needs to be replaced. When roads need such&nbsp;base repairs, they often appear&nbsp;to have wavy surfaces that&nbsp;distract drives,&nbsp;collect rain and form potholes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT is also using this closure as an opportunity to replace the top&nbsp;layer of pavement. Repaving the&nbsp;street will prevent potholes from occurring and prevent the need for a more&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;rebuild later on.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""We don't want to have to come back and repair West Burnside again in two weeks,&rdquo; said Suzanne Kahn, maintenance operations group manager for PBOT.&nbsp;&ldquo;With a few more days, we can leave the road in condition that will last&nbsp;one more decade&nbsp;rather than a few&nbsp;more&nbsp;weeks.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Crews are assessing what damage resulted from the slide and what stems from poor pavement condition. Crews from Portland General Electric and other utilities have been in the area this week, locating and protecting their infrastructure as PBOT crews dig into the roadway to make street improvements.</p>

<h2><strong>Closure area &amp; detour</strong></h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">The largest landslide to affect a Portland street this winter occurred at about 7 a.m. Wednesday, March 15. The road has been closed since then.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The public should stay away from the area until PBOT crews decide to reopen it. West Burnside is closed to people biking, walking or driving between NW Skyline Blvd and SW Barnes Road, near the Mount Calvary Cemetery. People driving through the area are encouraged to use U.S. 26 or NW Cornell Road as alternate routes, or consider public transit.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">A signed detour guides westbound traffic to use SW Skyline to Barnes Road, then to West Burnside. Eastbound traffic is directed to SW Barnes, then SW Skyline before returning to West Burnside.</p>
<h2>1,380 cubic yards removed</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews removed 1,380 cubic yards of debris on Wednesday through Friday. This is by far the largest of the 42 landslides PBOT crews have responded to this winter. A landslide on SW Skyline Blvd in February displaced more than 600 cubic yards of debris.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT crews using 12-yard dump trucks have hauled scores of loads from the site, and forestry crews have also hauled woody debris.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Winter storms and spring rain have taken a toll on hills in the Portland area. PBOT crews have responded to 42 landslides this season, through March 15.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The public should stay away from the area. We ask travelers to observe all street closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.</p>

<p>(9:15 a.m., Friday, March 24, 2017) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation has reopened West Burnside Road the traveling public earlier than expected, after the largest landslide of the season led to a closure March 15. The road had been expected to be reopened by 4 p.m. today.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; color: #000000; margin: 15px 0px 5px;""><span style=""background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"">After removing 1,380 cubic yards of debris from the road and hillside late last week, crews kept the road closed to make repairs to broken parts of the street. They also extended the closure several days to be able to repave the street, preventing the need for more road closures in coming weeks and more costly reconstruction years later.</span></p>
<p class=""gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #000000;"">PBOT maintenance crews worked 14-hour days to clear the slide, and continued 12-to-14 hour shifts in rain showers this week to get the street ready for a forecast sunny day on Thursday. Dry conditions are necessary for new pavement to cure properly.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #000000;"">""Our crews never cease to amaze me with their dedication to the public,"" said Leah Treat, director of PBOT. ""Many of the same people who drove snow plows for 12 hours a day this winter have continued to work extraordinary shifts to make the most of the handful of dry days we have had this spring. As we did on West Burnside, we will continue to work strategically, as long as the weather cooperates, to fill the backlog of potholes that have been frustrating Portlanders across the city.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #000000;"">PBOT would also like to thank Multnomah County for providing access to its disposal yard near West Burnside.

But with overtime and additional staffing drawn from other work, PBOT was able to repave nearly two lane miles of roadway in three days. One lane mile is equivalent to one 12-foot wide lane, one mile long.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #000000;"">PBOT combined two paving crews and used other staff who normally do other Maintenance Operations work to help with the effort, which included:</p>

<div class=""content-center""><span class=""gd_p"">A new crosswalk and median refuge island at SE 43rd and Hawthorne. Photo by Kirstin Byer, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">(March 31, 2017) The speed limit on SE Hawthorne Boulevard from SE 30th Avenue to SE 50th Avenue has changed from 25 mph to 20 mph and a new crosswalk is in place at SE 43rd Avenue as part of a series of safety improvements completed by the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) Traffic Maintenance and Operations crews along the business corridor.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/08/986097/1283800/visionzerologo_crop.png"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""166"" height=""166"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>The changes are the result of recommendations from a traffic crash investigation in 2016, after a young person was struck and killed while legally walking across SE Hawthorne at SE 43rd Avenue. In addition to a new crosswalk and speed change, PBOT crews constructed new ADA compliant curb ramps and a median refuge island at SE 43rd. They also moved parking away from corners at key intersections along SE Hawthorne to increase visibility and provide bike access to pedestrian signal buttons. Finally, striping crews restriped street markings throughout the corridor early this morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is another important step towards making Portland safe for all,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;I appreciate the Hawthorne business community&rsquo;s support for this project and look forward to working with other business districts to create safer conditions for people walking, biking, rolling and driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawthorne is one of the more deadly streets in the City. This was underscored by the tragic loss of a young and shining star in our community last year,"" said Transportation Director Leah Treat. ""PBOT is committed to Vision Zero and continues to deploy known methods to create safer streets across the city. This includes lowering speeds, building pedestrian refuge islands, and partnering with the police for enforcement of the most dangerous driving behaviors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new median refuge island at SE 43rd supports safety for people walking. The new midpoint crosswalk focuses crossing activity in one location, making crossing simpler. Left turns onto SE Hawthorne from SE 43rd will no longer be allowed and will reduce crash risk for all street users at the intersection.</p>
<p>More than half of deadly crashes occur on just 8 percent of Portland's streets.&nbsp;Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action Plan identifies 30 streets and 30 intersections across the city that make up the High Crash Network. SE Hawthorne is one of the streets on Portland&rsquo;s high crash network. From 2005 to 2014, one person died and nine people were seriously injured while traveling on the one-mile stretch of SE Hawthorne between SE 30th and SE 50th Avenue. In all,&nbsp;there were 420 crashes involving 881 people on the&nbsp;one-mile segment of Hawthorne from SE 30th Ave to SE 50th Ave.</p>
<p>Under state statute (<a href=""https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors811.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">see ORS 811.111</a>) PBOT has the authority to&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/594740?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">request speed limits</a>&nbsp;of 20 mph in business districts and 25 mph in residential areas. As part of its Vision Zero effort, the bureau is using that authority where needed to meet both Vision Zero goals and the intent of the statute, in this case a business corridor. PBOT&rsquo;s request to rescind the set speed and replace it with the statutory speed on SE Hawthorne was granted by the Oregon Department of Transportation in mid-March.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>About Vision Zero: &nbsp;</strong>The death or serious injury of even one person on Portland streets is one too many. Vision Zero is the bold goal to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries from Portland streets by 2025. On December 1, 2016, Portland City Council unanimously adopted the Portland Vision Zero Action Plan, which was developed by a 26-member task force made up of agency and community leaders. &nbsp;The Action Plan includes 32 data-driven actions that address the top factors that contribute to fatal and serious injury crashes.&nbsp;Learn more about Vision Zero by visiting&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.visionzeroportland.com</a>.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/634400

<p class=""gd_p"">This morning, users of the public bike sharing system found that more than 200 bicycles had been vandalized, with tires and seats slashed, and spokes cut. Graffiti obscured control screens on the bikes, as well as informational panels at stations and also screens of electronic kiosks used to check out bikes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;All Portlanders should be saddened and outraged by this senseless act of vandalism,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;The Transportation Bureau created BIKETOWN, with bikes owned by the public, to make bicycling easier and more convenient for everyone. Unfortunately, because of this criminal act, dozens or perhaps hundreds of Portlanders were not able to ride a bike this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Vandalizing a BIKETOWN bike is just as offensive as vandalizing a public bus or any other public property,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, director of PBOT. &ldquo;We will work with police and pursue all legal remedies to bring the perpetrators of this act to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Motivate, the City contractor that operates the BIKETOWN system, was cleaning up graffiti and repairing damaged bicycles within minutes of the first reports of the vandalism this morning.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN is key to Portland&rsquo;s effort to expand bicycling, fight climate change and create 20-minute neighborhoods called for in the city&rsquo;s long range plans. Since launching July 19, 2016, BIKETOWN has grown to 2,745 annual members and has been enjoyed by 45,542 people, who have taken 189,320 trips totaling 375,121 miles. People can sign-up for BIKETOWN membership via the BIKETOWN app or by visiting BIKETOWNPDX.com.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Anyone who sees someone in the act of vandalism or other crime in progress should call 9-1-1 immediately.</p>

News,634736,News Release: Speed Safety Cameras on SE Division and SE 122nd Avenue to start issuing tickets on Wednesday,1,,2017-04-05 16:12:51 UTC,2017-04-04 23:11:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(April 4, 2017) --&nbsp;The Speed Safety Cameras on SE Division Street and SE 122nd Avenue will start issuing speeding tickets on Wednesday, April 5, after 30 days of issuing warnings.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/08/986097/1010291/visionzerologo_crop.png"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""260"" height=""260"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>The goal of the Speed Safety Cameras is to reduce speeding and save lives. Both SE Division Street and SE 122nd Avenue are part of Portland&rsquo;s High Crash Network of roads. On these roads, people walking along or crossing on foot are twice as likely to be struck by a car than on the average city street.</p>
<p>The Speed Safety Cameras started issuing warnings on March 6th, and the 30-day warning period ends today, April 4th. Those drivers who exceeded the speed limit and were photographed by the cameras during this period received warning letters alerting them to their violation of the speed limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is already evidence that&nbsp;the average speeds of vehicles travelling on SE 122nd Avenue and SE Division have decreased substantially.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#9679; Before the cameras were installed, an average of 715 vehicles traveled 45 mph or faster on SE 122nd Avenue.</p>
<p>&#9679; &nbsp;After the cameras were installed, an average of 61 vehicles drove 45 mph and faster along SE 122nd Avenue reflecting a&nbsp;91% decrease&nbsp;from the speed survey.</p>
<p>&#9679; &nbsp;Before the cameras were installed, an average of 1,762 vehicles traveled 10 mph and more over the posted speed limit on SE Division Street.</p>
<p>&#9679; &nbsp;After the cameras were installed, an average of 514 vehicles drove 40 mph and faster along SE Division Street reflecting a&nbsp;71% decrease&nbsp;from the earlier count.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;I am very heartened by the early results from the speed safety cameras on Outer Division and SE 122nd,"" said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. ""These cameras work. They reduce speeding and by doing so, they are helping to make some of our most dangerous streets safer for all users.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Like the speed safety cameras we installed last fall on Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, the cameras on SE Division and SE 122nd have had an immediate impact,"" said Transportation Leah Treat. ""We are so focused on reducing speeding because it is one of the most significant contributing factors to deadly and serious crashes on our streets. If we can get people to slow down, we can save lives. It's that simple.""</p>

<div><span class=""gd_p"">On March 6, 2017, Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman installs warning signage near the Speed Safety Camera on SE Division. Photo credit: PBOT</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">The speed safety cameras on SE Division and on SE 122nd are the result of the 2015 passage of HB 2621, which allows them to be used on High Crash Corridors in the Portland city limits. The first cameras in Portland were installed on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway in the fall of 2016. The City of Portland has been using other cameras to supplement speed enforcement for years, with police officers in vans enforcing speed limit violations. Portland also uses cameras to increase enforcement compliance with red lights at traffic signals.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">When people exceed the posted speed limit while driving past the safety cameras, the camera systems capture photos and video for review by Portland Police. An officer from the Portland Police Bureau will review violations before a citation is issued. Penalties are the same as a speeding violation initiated by any other means. The typical speeding citation in Oregon is a Class C violation (11 to 20 mph in excess of the speed limit) resulting in a $160 fine. HB 2621 requires that money received from the speeding tickets can only be spent to cover the cost of the program or pay for safety improvements and programs on High Crash Corridors. PBOT plans to install additional speed safety cameras on NE Marine Drive later this year.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Speed Safety Cameras program provides ample warning to people driving in the area. State law requires speed signage and speed reader boards to be installed on the street warning drivers more than 100 yards in advance of the cameras in both directions.&nbsp; Speed&nbsp;reader board displays a driver&rsquo;s current rate of speed providing immediate feedback in advance of the fixed speed safety camera.&nbsp;PBOT staff also conducted extensive outreach with local neighborhood associations, community organizations and businesses through mail, meetings, visits and community radio to raise awareness of the changes along the two corridors, before the cameras were installed.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to the new cameras, PBOT is delivering additional safety and maintenance projects. For example, PBOT will<a href=""/transportation/article/589856?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;enhance SE 122nd Avenue</a>&nbsp;crossings by installing rapid flashing beacons, pedestrian islands, a pedestrian hybrid beacon as well as new sidewalks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Along SE Division,<a href=""/transportation/article/621551?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;projects</a>&nbsp;include:</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&#9679; Accelerated timelines for federally-funded safety projects on outer SE Division, including the East Portland Active Transportation (EPAT) and Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) projects. The projects now slated for construction in 2017 include pedestrian crossings with median islands and Rapid Flashing Beacons or Pedestrian Hybrid Signals to complement sidewalk infill.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&#9679; Expansion of the East Portland In Motion (EPIM) buffered bike lane project on outer SE Division St to a multi-modal safety project, with focus in the Jade and Division Midway Alliance Districts.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&#9679; Installation of additional speed reader boards at four locations from SE 82nd to the city limits to educate drivers and reduce speeding.</p>

News,636444,"News Release: Mayor Wheeler, Commissioner Saltzman launch Smart Autonomous Vehicles Initiative",1,,2017-04-19 16:35:02 UTC,2017-04-19 01:00:00 UTC,A,"With this initiative, they directed the Portland Bureau of Transportation to develop autonomous vehicle policies and solicit proposals from companies that would test autonomous vehicles on Portland streets by the end of the year.","<p>(April 19, 2017) Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and City Commissioner Dan Saltzman today announced the Smart Autonomous Vehicles Initiative (SAVI). With this initiative, they directed the Portland Bureau of Transportation to develop autonomous vehicle policies and solicit proposals from companies that would test autonomous vehicles on Portland streets by the end of the year.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">At the Portland Business Alliance&rsquo;s April Forum Breakfast: &ldquo;The Road to Autonomous Vehicles,&rdquo; sponsored by Portland General Electric, Wheeler made the announcement. At a news conference after the breakfast, Wheeler and Saltzman signed a directive telling Leah Treat, director of PBOT, to launch the initiative.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s long history of transportation innovation is about to enter a new chapter,&rdquo; Wheeler said. &ldquo;My goal is to have an autonomous vehicle pilot program in Portland, working for Portlanders, by the end of the year. To the inventors, investors and innovators, I&rsquo;m here to say that Portland is open for business. By working with private industry, we can make sure that cutting edge technology expands access to public transit and reduces pollution and congestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">It&rsquo;s important for autonomous vehicles to improve safety, said Saltzman, the commissioner who oversees PBOT.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Good rules allow business and government to work together, rather than at odds,&rdquo; Saltzman said. &ldquo;Autonomous vehicles can make our streets safer by taking human error out of the equation. As we work towards our Vision Zero goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries, the public has a right to expect that the city will help make sure that safety standards are met. Autonomous vehicles should help us meet our safety, equity, climate change and economic goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In crafting this initiative, we will build on the experience and know-how we gained as a finalist in the USDOT&rsquo;s Smart City challenge last year, said Treat, the director of PBOT.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This directive sets the framework for making smart choices about emerging technology,&rdquo; Treat said. &ldquo;Realizing the potential of autonomous vehicles starts with making smart choices and setting clear standards that support the interests of the autonomous vehicle industry and our community. We will look to the first autonomous vehicle pilots for valuable information about the performance of AVs and how we can harness this technology to increase affordable transportation, reduce congestion and fight pollution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The directive tells PBOT to take four actions to advance SAVI within the next 60 days:</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Propose for City Council and public consideration Interim Transportation System Plan (TSP) policies that ensure connected and autonomous vehicles will serve Portland&rsquo;s safety, equity, climate change, and economic goals;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Publish a Request for Information (RFI) that invites AV testing specific to advancing safety, equity, climate, and economic goals;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adopt an Interim Administrative Rule that provides a clear path to permit innovators to apply to test, pilot or deploy AVs in Portland; and</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop public engagement, reporting, and evaluation plans that ensure Portland residents, workers, and businesses have opportunities to shape the &ldquo;rules of the road&rdquo; for AVs in Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland General Electric (NYSE: POR), the largest electric utility in the metropolitan area, said the initiative could help grow the local economy and reduce emissions with electric vehicles.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Evolving our transportation infrastructure is one of the great challenges, and the great opportunities, we face in the Portland region,&rdquo; said Charlie Allcock, Business Development Director for Portland General Electric.&nbsp; &ldquo;The transportation sector contributes over 40 percent of greenhouse gas emissions here in Oregon. And increased traffic and congestion could put a damper on economic growth. We applaud Mayor Wheeler&rsquo;s decision to make Portland a mecca for innovative solutions and new jobs, and will work closely with the city area as we move towards a smart, shared, self-driving and emission-free transportation future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Portland announcement was praised by Transportation for America, a Washington, D.C-based alliance of elected, business and civic leaders from communities across the country that advocates for investment in smart, homegrown, locally-driven transportation solutions.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reshape our cities, and we&rsquo;re excited to see that Portland is taking proactive steps to ensure that this coming transformation in urban mobility is harnessed effectively to move them closer to their economic, safety, equity and environmental goals,&rdquo; said Russ Brooks, Director of Smart Cities for Transportation for America. &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s commitment to engaging the public to shape this future together should be a model for other cities. And their push to work together with other local, regional and state leaders to flesh out state legislation that works for cities should be a model for the federal government as they progress toward making national policy for autonomous vehicles.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/636444
News,637200,News Release: Better Naito upstart spirit lives on in City-supported project,1,,2017-04-27 21:10:32 UTC,2017-04-27 01:16:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=637258"" alt=""Better Naito"" width=""250"" height=""375"" /></p>
<p>(April 27, 2017) City, community and business leaders gathered at Tom McCall Waterfront Park today to celebrate the third annual Better Naito street transformation. The project, which creates a safe space for people to travel to and along Waterfront Park during the busy summer months, will last for five months from April 28 to September 30, 2017.</p>
<p>After two successful summers of Better Naito run by volunteers from Better Block PDX and other community partners, City Council unanimously voted in November 2016 to make Better Naito an official City program, directing the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) to implement it, and provided funding to sustain the project for five summers.</p>
<p>This year, the bureau has implemented additional safety features and protections to make access to Waterfront Park safer for all users. Thanks to Fixing Our Streets funding, the bureau installed a new pedestrian signal at SW Naito Parkway and SW Main St for improved safety and updated the traffic signal at NW Naito and NW Davis St to reduce conflicts at the Steel Bridge ramp by installing a right turn signal and bike signal. The bureau also installed white plastic posts to the north of the Better Naito installation between NW Davis and NW Ironside Terrace to better delineate the existing bike lanes.</p>
<p>Instead of the temporary construction cones of previous years, PBOT has installed removable white plastic posts to delineate one northbound motor vehicle lane on SW Naito Parkway, converting it to open space for the public to walk and bike and roll safely to Waterfront Park&rsquo;s festivals and community events. The posts are installed the entire one-mile length of Better Naito, between SW Main and NW Couch St.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safety for Portlanders should always be our top priority,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman, &ldquo;I thank my colleagues on City Council for their support of Better Naito, particularly Commissioner Amanda Fritz and her staff at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, for their support of this project. I look forward to seeing how Better Naito continues to improve access to Waterfront Park over the next five months and the next five summers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been rewarding to watch Better Naito mature from a student-led pilot project to a seasonal fixture,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;Community driven projects like these are emblematic of Portland's rich history of embracing public spaces for people. Better Naito also provides a solution to mobility challenges as people flock to the westbank throughout the summer to enjoy our many festivals and beautiful riverfront. This project would not be here today without the countless hours of volunteer work by dozens of people from Better Block PDX, Rose Festival and other community events at Waterfront Park.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the largest of many events that use Waterfront Park, we are grateful that the City has embraced the Better Naito concept for a safer and more family friendly access to the Festival,&rdquo; said Jeff Curtis, Rose Festival Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;The installation of the new crossing and bike signals, plus adding a designated loading zone are huge improvements to public safety access along Naito and help make it safer for everyone responsible for operations as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Block PDX is so proud to have been involved with this project and the process that it has spurred. Our goals as a group are to show what can happen when we consider designing our public spaces for people, and Better Naito does just that,&rdquo; said Better Block PDX core volunteer, Gwen Shaw. &ldquo;When we first put this idea out there, we didn&rsquo;t know what people would think, but we&rsquo;ve been able to use this amazing space as a living workshop and really experiment in ways that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t be possible. And we thank City Council and PBOT for allowing us to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=637259"" alt=""Better Naito"" width=""250"" height=""166.625"" />Every year the festivals in Tom McCall Waterfront Park draw hundreds of thousands of people. During the peak season between April and November an additional 15,000 more people per day visit the Waterfront. Better Naito creates a new multiuse path on the west side of Waterfront Park, providing another connection for people walking and biking between the Hawthorne and Steel bridges.</p>
<p>The addition of <a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/"">BIKETOWN </a>to Portland&rsquo;s streets last year means that people will have another way to travel to and on Better Naito this summer. <a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/map"">Two BIKETOWN stations</a> are conveniently located adjacent to the installation at SW Salmon and Naito and SW Naito at Ankeny Plaza. In addition, BIKETOWN users will be able to park within many of the festivals at Waterfront Park this summer, including Portland Rose Festival CityFair, Pride NW, the Waterfront Blues Festival and Oregon Brewer&rsquo;s Fest.</p>
<p>Loading and unloading of passengers and freight will be managed by PBOT and enforced by the Parking Enforcement division. The bureau has <a href=""/transportation/article/635459"">designated a passenger drop off and pick up zone</a> on the north side of SW Taylor, closest to SW Naito. PBOT&rsquo;s Parking Enforcement officers will be citing vehicles stopped in Better Naito without loading permits.</p>
<p>The Better Naito project was first piloted in 2015 to help manage this influx of visitors, create a safe space for people to travel to these events, and to reduce conflicts between people walking and biking and driving along the Waterfront in the summer months. The first Better Naito was a 2-week pilot project developed by Better Block PDX, Portland State University, and a host of community partners. Prior to Better Naito, people were often forced to walk in the bike lane, squeeze into narrow dirt paths, or bike in a travel lane with motor vehicles to reach Waterfront events. The volunteer-led effort championed by the non-profit Better Block PDX improved the Waterfront Park experience during its busiest season and was implemented again in the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>Feedback is welcomed via email at NaitoParkway@PortlandOregon.gov. You can also leave a voice message at 503-823-4321. The public is encouraged to share their feedback on social media with the hashtag #BetterNaito.</p>

I can&rsquo;t wait to see the ideas we get from Portland students!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Libraries are all about sharing, whether that means ideas, resources or support,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Library Director Vailey Oehlke. &ldquo;With Bike to Books, we&rsquo;re teaming up with important partners in PBOT and Metro to share the joy around reading, learning and biking with an eye toward safety and sustainability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making our streets safe for people of all ages and abilities is a cornerstone of Metro's transportation work,&rdquo; said Metro Councilor Bob Stacey. &ldquo;Ensuring that kids like my grandsons can safely pedal to and from the library is what it's all about!&rdquo;</p>

News,637907,"PBOT Traffic Advisory: Parking restricted on SE Division Street Wednesday, Thursday morning for surveying",1,,2017-05-03 17:41:12 UTC,2017-05-03 17:38:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(May 2, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that surveying for upcoming safety and public transit improvements will require on-street parking to be restricted for a few hours on SE Division on Wednesday and Thursday morning.</p>
<p>On Wednesday May 3, on-street parking will be prohibited from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. in various locations along SE Division from SE 10th Avenue to 82nd Avenue. On Thursday, May 4, on-street parking will be prohibited from 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. along SE Division from 82nd Avenue to the city limits, near SE 174th Avenue.</p>
<p>No-parking barricades will be placed along the curb in areas where parking will be restricted. Areas without barricades are not restricted. The barricades will be removed after the work is completed, so the restriction might not last as long as expected.</p>
<p>The effort will save time and money for transportation improvements, by allowing the data to be shared by PBOT and TriMet as the agencies design upcoming projects. Removing parking to scan the street will help reduce the need to close travel lanes or sidewalks for surveying. Engineers making plans for upcoming improvements will use a car-mounted camera to gather comprehensive survey and mapping data of the right-of-way, gathering the precise locations of curbs, sidewalks and storm drains.</p>

News,639438,"PBOT Traffic Advisory: Street improvements require overnight closure of SE Belmont, lane closures on SE Cesar Chavez Blvd Friday night",1,,2017-05-16 18:53:02 UTC,2017-05-16 18:51:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(May 16, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that installation of new traffic signals and repaving a busy intersection will require overnight closures of SE Belmont Street at SE Cesar E Chavez Blvd overnight Friday night. SE Cesar E Chavez Blvd will be open for travel at all times, but lanes will be reduced from four to two during the work hours.</p>
<p>The work is funded by the Major Maintenance and Asset Replacement Program, which reserves half of all one-time, surplus general fund dollars for improvements that maintain or replace critical infrastructure. The work is part of a $1 million Traffic Signal Rebuilds project. The new signal will replace a traffic signal that was built in 1950.</p>
<p>As part of the project, the contractor will repave the intersection. The paving work will take place overnight, from 10 p.m. on Friday, May 19, until the work is completed, potentially as early as 5 a.m. on Saturday, May 20. The work has been scheduled to minimize the impact on the traveling public.</p>
<p>Eastbound and westbound SE Belmont Street will have detours from 10 p.m. on Friday through 5 a.m. on Saturday. Travel on SE Cesar E Chavez Blvd will remain open, with one lane in each direction. The paving work during this time will occur in 2 phases, with different detours for each phase. The detours are as follows:</p>
<p>Phase 1 Detour<br />Eastbound traffic on SE Belmont St will be detoured south at SE 30th Ave to eastbound on SE Hawthorne Blvd and northbound on SE Cesar Chavez Blvd back to SE Belmont St. Westbound traffic will be detoured south at SE Cesar Chavez Blvd to westbound on SE Hawthorne Blvd and northbound on SE 30th Ave back to SE Belmont St.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase 2 Detour<br />Eastbound traffic on SE Belmont St will be detoured north at SE Cesar Chavez Blvd to eastbound on SE Stark St and southbound on SE 49th Ave back to SE Belmont St. Westbound traffic will be detoured north at SE 49th Ave to westbound on SE Stark St and southbound on SE Cesar Chavez Blvd back to SE Belmont St.</p>
<p>After 5 a.m. on Saturday until the work is completed, there are expected to be no detours. Flaggers will accommodate one lane of travel for east and westbound traffic on SE Belmont St.</p>
<p>The traveling public is advised to travel cautiously, observe the closure signage and directions by reader boards and detour signage.</p>
<p>This work is weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>

<p class=""gdp"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">As presenting sponsor of Sunday Parkways, Kaiser Permanente and its employees put health and safety first, so Dr. Manalo says she especially appreciates how safe the rides are for families. &ldquo;We have a sense of security riding on the routes with young kids, and not having to worry about cars. The community volunteers and neighbors we pass are always very welcoming. We&rsquo;ve been able to explore and appreciate different parts of Portland, and the kids love the fun freebies along the way, like T-shirts and bike bells. They&rsquo;re especially excited about this year&rsquo;s scavenger hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">While Dr. Manalo usually rides with her family, she often enjoys bringing friends along for the ride. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been great to ride and hang out with friends, and take our lunch break together to sample some of the great food trucks along the way.

<p class=""gd_p"">Users who download Parking Kitty onto their smart phones will no longer need to pull a paper receipt from a City of Portland parking kiosk. Users simply need to enter the parking zone and their license plate number into the app. The app also allows users to remotely monitor how much time they have left and extend their parking time up to the maximum allowed in the parking zone.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">""We want it to be easy to pay for parking in Portland. We also want it to be fun. Parking Kitty helps us do both. As a mobile app, it makes it convenient for Portlanders and visitors to pay for parking. We chose the name to reflect some of our city&rsquo;s creativity and hopefully bring a smile to Portland&rsquo;s drivers,&rdquo; said Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We want it to be simple and efficient to find and pay for parking because well-managed on-street parking is good for drivers, good for business and good for our transportation system.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has seen great success with Passport Parking's app used in our&nbsp;Washington Park, and we're excited to join PBOT in rolling out the second generation app, Parking Kitty,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;With this new app, visitors can park and enjoy all the world-class attractions of&nbsp;Washington Park&nbsp;without running back to the meter to add more time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Portland State is very excited to be a partner in this innovative new app that creates a simple and efficient way for our students, faculty, staff and guests to pay for parking,"" said Ian Stude, PSU Transportation and Parking Services Director. ""Parking Kitty makes on-demand parking easier for the PSU community -- many of whom drive infrequently and walk, bike, or use public transportation to get to campus.""</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">News Release:</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center"">PBOT announces BIKETOWN expansion in North, Northeast and Southeast Portland</h2>
<p class=""gd_p content-left"">(June 1, 2017) With sunny skies and prime biking weather returning to Portland, Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman along with PBOT officials and Alberta Main Street representatives announced a substantial expansion of the BIKETOWN service area today.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In North Portland, the service area is expanding to the west to North Gay Avenue and will bring BIKETOWN to the Overlook neighborhood&rsquo;s main street, N Killingsworth. A satellite expansion is also being piloted on Swan Island around the Daimler Trucks North America campus. The Northeast expansion will extend north to Jarrett Street and north east to NE 33rd Avenue north of Prescott and to NE 21st Avenue south of Prescott. It will encompass the Alberta Street business district along with businesses on N and NE Killingsworth. Two expansions in Southeast Portland will include Brooklyn's main street district and extend the boundary east to SE 43rd Avenue and 44th Avenue between SE Alder and Harrison.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""We launched BIKETOWN just over ten months ago,"" said Commissioner Dan Saltzman, ""and already we are expanding it. That is a testament to BIKETOWN's popularity. I am especially glad that this expansion is possible without any additional cost to the public.""&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Starting on day one, we received questions about when we would be expanding BIKETOWN,"" said Director Leah Treat. ""That is why today is so exciting. With this expansion, we're delivering for our fellow Portlanders and bringing the benefits of BIKETOWN to more neighborhoods and businesses.""&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT opened a public comment period on the expansion on May 2nd, 2017. Over 800 Portlanders provided input, and the response was overwhelmingly in support of the proposed expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As part of the changes to the BIKETOWN service area, PBOT has also created two super hubs where users may park a BIKETOWN bike at any public rack without an additional charge. The hubs are located in the Central Eastside Industrial District and the PSU campus. Launched in May, PBOT has already seen a rise in the number of trips taken within the super hub areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(June 5, 2017)&nbsp;Providing places for people to securely lock their bicycles is one small, but important, way that the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) encourages people to ride. PBOT has installed and maintains over 7,000 bike racks throughout the city. We have two new bike parking developments we&rsquo;re excited to share with you.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/06/1390681/1376178/6752203911-01a958750f-o_crop.jpg"" alt=""bike corral in Portland"" hspace=""7"" width=""346"" height=""247"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>PBOT currently has more on-street bike parking spaces than any other North American city &ndash; over 2,000! In Portland, we call them &ldquo;bike corrals,&rdquo; groups of bike racks installed in place of an auto parking spot. Most of our bike corrals can accommodate 12 to 18 bikes in the place of about two cars.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">We want to know how many people are using the bike corrals and&nbsp;we&rsquo;re hoping the community can help us collect the data. We&rsquo;ve launched a&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bikecorrals?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">quick online reporting</a>&nbsp;site where you can tell us how many bikes are parked at a bike corral. The next time you park or see a bike corral please take a few brief moments to tell us how many bikes you see parked. This will help us evaluate how well we&rsquo;re meeting the community&rsquo;s bike parking needs.&nbsp;<strong>Check out the online reporting site at&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=""http://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bikecorrals?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.surveymonkey.com/r/bikecorrals</a>&nbsp;</strong><strong>and add it to your bookmarks so you&rsquo;ll be able to quickly report bike corral usage when you are out and about.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve had over 150 reports thus far, but we&rsquo;re aiming for thousands! The more data the better!</p>

<p>PBOT is also pleased to announce our newly updated bike rack design (see picture). The newly designed and fabricated bike racks have additional security features inside and out to make it more difficult for potential thieves to cut through the racks and remove a bike that&rsquo;s locked. Our partners at Radius Pipe Bending in Junction City, OR&nbsp;manufacture these racks for us. We&rsquo;ve just got our first shipment, but you&rsquo;ll be seeing more of them on the streets soon. While we can&rsquo;t replace all 7,000 of the existing racks with the new design, all new rack installations and any maintenance work will include the updated design.</p>

The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions throughout the year in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane. Drivers should continually scan their environment watching for people crossing or about to cross and stop according to Oregon law.</p>

Idling your car during school drop-off and pick-up is a toxic health hazard that harms our children. Idling also gets zero miles to the gallon.</p>
<p><br />Vehicle exhaust is the leading source of toxic air pollution in Oregon. It seems counter intuitive, but we actually pollute our own immediate air quality &mdash; inside the vehicle &mdash; when we idle. And, vehicle exhaust is associated with worsening symptoms for children with asthma.</p>
<p><br />What you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the car off if idling for more than 10 seconds (except in traffic of course!). You&rsquo;ll save money, the environment, and our student&rsquo;s lungs.</li>
<li>Ask your school&rsquo;s principal to post a no idling sign, like the one at right, at your school.</li>

News,645028,PBOT News Blog: City Council commits $1.4 million annually to Vision Zero street safety (en español),1,,2017-06-30 01:31:49 UTC,2017-06-30 01:30:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gdp"">(Para leer en espa&ntilde;ol, lea a continuaci&oacute;n)</p>
<p class=""gdp"">By Brian Armada</p>
<p class=""gdp""><em>PBOT staff</em></p>
<p class=""gdp"">(June 29, 2017)&nbsp;Portland City Council&rsquo;s newly adopted 2017-18 budget includes $1.4 million in annual funding, plus $125,000 in one-time funding, for street safety fixes that support Vision Zero.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The new funding is from tax revenue associated with local sales of marijuana. With strong support from Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Commissioner Amanda Fritz proposed committing the funds for Vision Zero at a council session on May 16. Her budget amendment was unanimously adopted. City Council formally approved Portland&rsquo;s 2017-18 budget on June 8.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Mayor Wheeler and each of the other City Council members have consistently backed Vision Zero, a citywide initiative to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2025. PBOT and partners are six months into a 32-step Action Plan that addresses the top four causes of deadly crashes: street design, speed, impairment, and other dangerous behaviors, including distracted driving.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;It is gratifying to work with commissioners who understand the importance of safe streets,&rdquo; PBOT Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;These additional funds will accelerate our work to redesign streets to help keep people safe, especially our most vulnerable road users.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">PBOT will move quickly to invest the new funds in street safety projects. Staff solicited feedback on 27 options for street safety fixes during the latest Vision Zero Task Force meeting on June 15. Task Force members expressed strong support for projects in Communities of Concern, a set of 10 equity indicators that include income, access to transit and race/ethnicity. PBOT staff will use the Task Force feedback to finalize a project list for design and construction over the next two years.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">All 27 of the project options would improve safety on the High Crash Network, the 30 highest-crash streets in Portland. Project options include the planning and construction of enhanced crosswalks at transit stops, improved lighting, protected bike lanes and rumble strips. In addition to street safety, PBOT is investing $300,000 of the new marijuana revenue in an outreach campaign to support safe driving speeds.</p>

<h1>News Blog:&nbsp;El ayuntamiento asigna $1.4 millones en fondos anuales para la seguridad de las calles Vision Zero</h1>
<p class=""gdp"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">By Brian Armada</p>
<p class=""gdp""><em>PBOT Escritor</em></p>
<p class=""gdp"">El nuevo presupuesto aprobado por el ayuntamiento de Portland para el a&ntilde;o fiscal 2017-18 incluye fondos anuales de $1.4 millones, m&aacute;s $125,000 de financiaci&oacute;n &uacute;nica, para los arreglos de carretera que formaran parte de Vision Zero.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Los nuevos fondos ser&aacute;n recaudados con los ingresos de los impuestos de ventas de marihuana. Con el apoyo firme del comisario Dan Saltzman, quien supervisa el Burea de Transportaci&oacute;n de Portland, la comisaria Amanda Fritz propuso comprometer los fondos para Vision Zero en una sesi&oacute;n de ayuntamiento el 16 de mayo. Su enmienda presupuestaria fue adoptada de manera un&aacute;nime. El ayuntamiento aprob&oacute; el presupuesto el 8 de junio.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">El alcalde Wheeler y todos los comisarios han apoyado Vision Zero a toda fuerza desde su incepci&oacute;n. El objetivo de esta visi&oacute;n es reducir y eliminar las fatalidades de tr&aacute;fico, junto con las heridas graves, por el a&ntilde;o 2025. El Bureau de Transportaci&oacute;n y sus socios est&aacute;n en el proceso de implementar un plan de acci&oacute;n con 32 pasos que aborda las cuatro causas principales de accidentes y colisiones. Las causes incluyen: el dise&ntilde;o de las carreteras, la velocidad, la discapacidad, y otros h&aacute;bitos peligrosos como manejar distra&iacute;do.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Es gratificante trabajar con los comisarios que entienden la importancia de la seguridad de nuestras carreteras&rdquo; calific&oacute; la directora del Bureau de Transportaci&oacute;n, Leah Treat. &ldquo;Estos fondos adicionales aceleraran nuestros esfuerzos para redise&ntilde;ar las calles y ayudaran a mantener las callas seguras, especialmente para nuestros m&aacute;s vulnerables.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">El bureau actuara r&aacute;pidamente para invertir los nuevos fondos en proyectos de seguridad. Durante la &uacute;ltima junta del equipo operativo de Vision Zero, el personal solicit&oacute; comentarios e informaci&oacute;n sobre 27 opciones para proyectos que mejoraran la seguridad de las carreteras. Los miembros de este grupo expresaron su firme apoyo para los proyectos en las &ldquo;Communities of concern&rdquo; &ndash; un t&eacute;rmino utilizado por el bureau para denominar las comunidades en m&aacute;s necesidad de inversiones. Una comunidad es designada &ldquo;community of concern&rdquo; bas&aacute;ndose en diez indicadores de equidad, por ejemplo: los niveles de ingresos, acceso al transporte, y raza. El Bureau de Transportaci&oacute;n utilizara esta informaci&oacute;n para finalizar una lista de proyectos que ser&aacute;n dise&ntilde;ados y construidos en los pr&oacute;ximos dos a&ntilde;os.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Las 27 opciones mejoraran la seguridad en lo que es designado como el &ldquo;high crash network&rdquo; que significa &ldquo;la red de colisiones&rdquo; donde principalmente se concentran los accidentes. Esta red incluye las 30 calles de Portland con m&aacute;s accidentes. Las opciones de proyectos incluyen mejorar los paseos de peatones en paradas de tr&aacute;nsito, mejorar la iluminaci&oacute;n en las paradas, e instalar carriles de bicicleta protegidos. Adem&aacute;s de inversiones en seguridad, el bureau tambi&eacute;n invertir&aacute; $300,000 de los nuevos fondos en una campa&ntilde;a comunitaria para informar y concienciar la importancia de manejar a niveles de velocidad seguros.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">This past May, PBOT and Multnomah County Library, with support from Metro, invited students living in Multnomah County from Pre-Kindergarten to 12th Grade to&nbsp;design bike lane art for&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73492?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;Bike to Books&rdquo; Bike Month coloring contest</a>. For years Portlanders have enjoyed the smile-inducing bike lane art designed by PBOT&rsquo;s striping crews. The designs are created by crew members and can be found in bike lanes and on neighborhood greenways across the city.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Coloring pages were available for pick up at all Multnomah County Library branches (<a href=""https://multcolib.org/hours-and-locations?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">click here for locations</a>) or&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73492?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">downloaded online</a>.

News,646262,"News Release: State transportation bill makes big investment in safety, public transit and Safe Routes to School",1,,2017-07-12 18:54:11 UTC,2017-07-10 23:47:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(July 10, 2017) The transportation package passed by the state legislature will invest in critical safety and maintenance improvements that will make a big difference for Portlanders and all Oregonians, said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">""This is an exciting and impressive package of transportation projects and maintenance funds for our entire state but also the City of Portland,"" Saltzman said. ""I look forward to working with community partners, our employees and the private sector in bringing good projects and needed maintenance to Portland&rsquo;s streets due to this unprecedented level of investment. Thank you Oregon legislators and Governor for working hard and making this happen.""</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Highlights of the transportation package's investments in Portland include:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Reconstruction and safety improvements for a 4-mile section of <strong>Powell Boulevard,</strong> from SE 99th Avenue to the city limits near SE 174th Avenue. The&nbsp;$110 million project will completely rebuild this high crash corridor, transforming it from a crash-prone highway to an urban main street with safe access for people biking, walking and taking public transit. The Oregon Department of Transportation will rebuild the street, and as crews complete segments in coming years, they will transfer them to City ownership.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The statewide <strong>Safe Routes to School Program </strong>will have $10 million a year, growing to $15 million a year in 2022. Portland would be able to compete for grants to build sidewalks, crosswalks and bike lanes that make it safer for families to bike and walk to school.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Renovation of Interstate 5</strong> and city streets in the Rose Quarter to improve safety on NE Broadway, the street with the highest bicycle crash rate in Portland and the fifth highest pedestrian crash rate. It would provide a lid over the freeway to improve bicycle, pedestrian and public transit access and safety. Shoulders and other highway fixes would reduce the rate of crashes on this key corridor by 50 percent.<br /><br /></li>
<li>An investment of $35 million to $40 million a year for <strong>TriMet bus operations and purchases,</strong> providing greatly expanded service in line with the City&rsquo;s longstanding transportation goals, and also providing a low-income fare for the first time. PBOT also has plans to make more bus-only lanes and transit priority traffic signals that will improve bus service by helping buses get through rush-hour congestion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The City of Portland strongly supports investment in transportation infrastructure to improve public safety, grow the economy and help reduce carbon pollution. The $5.3 billion package is the first new funding for transportation since the legislature approved House Bill 2001 in 2009.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(July 11, 2017)&nbsp;Portland summers are a welcome respite from the rainy days that occur for most of the year. It is during the summer that Portlanders take full advantage of the sun, and come together to celebrate their communities. Such was the case on Friday, the June 23, when artists, families, and community leaders gathered at a block party in front of the Emerson Street House, which opened about a year ago under the coordination of Diane Freaney and Sabin CDC,&nbsp;in Northeast Portland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">This was the second year that Nikki Sandoval, also known as Nikki Brown Clown, a Portland-raised jack-of-all-trades, has coordinated a block party for her former neighborhood on Emerson Street.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nikki is currently based in California, but was able to apply for her block party remotely using Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s <a href=""http://www.pbotblockparty.com"">new online application</a>. For Nikki, her Portland community is greatly important to her; the same can be said for the families and creatives that have been touched by her passion and dedication to empower local youth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The block party on Emerson Street happened on a hot Friday afternoon. The street was closed off to vehicles allowing for sprinklers, performances, and face painting (among other activities) to occur in a space that is otherwise perceived as site for moving cars. Hosting a block party is a great way to empower communities who can reclaim their neighborhoods for pedestrian use. Block parties such as these remind us that creativity, diversity, and community are truly what makes Portland such a special place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">On Friday, July 21, Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman, PBOT, BIKETOWN, and advocates and members of Portland&rsquo;s disability community will come together to launch the newest program in the BIKETOWN family,&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73371?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Adaptive BIKETOWN</a>, an adaptive bicycle rental pilot program.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;BIKETOWN has been transformational for Portland,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;The orange bikes have made it easy for locals and visitors alike to experience the world class network of comfortable bike routes that generations of Portlanders have built. I look forward to watching BIKETOWN continue to grow in the coming years.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This past year, 75,521 BIKETOWN riders have biked 602,266 miles. Among the riders enjoying the bright orange bikes are some of Portland&rsquo;s star athletes,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BIWixgGjUS6/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">CJ McCollum</a>&nbsp;of the Portland Trail Blazers and Portland Thorns&rsquo; Goalkeeper&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BVdipBKFE4i/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Adrianna Franch</a>. Other notable riders have included Grimm star&nbsp;<a href=""https://twitter.com/mistergiuntoli/status/755617108558360577?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">David Giuntoli</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BV8V-kZjXk6/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Mayor Ted Wheeler</a>, who rode a special Pride-themed bike in this year&rsquo;s Pride Parade. And dozens of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dogsofbiketown/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&ldquo;dogs of BIKETOWN</a>&rdquo; have taken rides in the famous BIKETOWN basket. On social media, people have shared their experiences riding around the city, some&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BIVvSQGjYHr/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">learning to ride a bike for the first time</a>, others discovering&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BUGNcsohpZC/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">new neighborhoods and businesses</a>, and some even using BIKETOWN bikes to&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BPN9tFWgv9p/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">haul cargo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BOBHiqdAiC1/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">get around town</a>&nbsp;during this past winter&rsquo;s many snow storms.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The city is already seeing the impact of the bike share system on its modal goals. According to the most recent user survey, 26 percent of BIKETOWN trips made by Portlanders replace auto trips. 64 percent of BIKETOWN&rsquo;s local users say they&rsquo;re biking more since joining. Five percent of BIKETOWN&rsquo;s local users say they&rsquo;ve reduced the number of personal vehicles because of the bike share program.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;BIKETOWN is helping Portlanders make the shift to cycling,&rdquo; said Leah Treat, director of PBOT. &ldquo;Not only is it bringing in new riders (as well as adorable dog and cat passengers), but BIKETOWN has already become a part of Portland&rsquo;s many bicycle traditions, like Sunday Parkways, Pedalpalooza and the World Naked Bike Ride. That tells me that this program is here to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In the course of its first year, BIKETOWN has already grown and spread its reach to new communities.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The launch of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/pricing/biketown-for-all?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN for All</a>, a membership program that offers discounted memberships to Portlanders living on low incomes, in the fall of 2016 added 130 new members to the system. Three of the top ten BIKETOWN riders for both mileage and trips are BIKETOWN for All members, a testament to its value. The BIKETOWN for all program is a partnership between the Community Cycling Center (CCC), PBOT, Motivate, the Better Bike Share Partnership, and participating affordable housing communities, social service agencies and local nonprofits.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This May, BIKETOWN launched two super hubs where users may park a BIKETOWN bike at any public rack without an additional charge. The hubs are located in the Central Eastside Industrial District and the PSU campus.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In June, BIKETOWN launched its first service area expansion. In North Portland, the service area expansion brought BIKETOWN to the Overlook neighborhood&rsquo;s main street, N Killingsworth. The Northeast expansion extended BIKETOWN north to Jarrett Street and northeast to NE 33rd Avenue north of Prescott and to NE 21st Avenue south of Prescott. It also added the Alberta Street business district along with businesses on N and NE Killingsworth. Two expansions in Southeast Portland added Brooklyn's main street district and extended the boundary east to SE 43rd Avenue and 44th Avenue between SE Alder and Harrison. A satellite expansion pilot on Swan Island around the Daimler Trucks North America campus is also underway.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Nike believes in the power of sport to unleash human potential and build community, and BIKETOWN beautifully embodies that spirit here in Portland,&rdquo; said Jorge Casimiro, Nike Vice President of Global Community Impact. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to celebrate BIKETOWN's first birthday, and are proud of the milestone moments we have marked together with the City of Portland and the Portland Bureau of Transportation--from the launch of the iconic orange Nike shoebox design of the BIKETOWN bike, to the release of three limited-edition bike wraps representing legendary sneaker designs and two designs reflecting the BETRUE call-to-action celebrating the LGBTQ community in June. It&rsquo;s an honor to help make Portland an even more vibrant, active and innovative culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN is sponsored by Nike, Inc. Nike&rsquo;s title sponsorship of the program allowed the City to expand the initial number of bike share bicycles available to the public at its launch and put the system on a trajectory of sustainable, long-term growth. The system was able to launch with 1000 bikes, a 66 percent increase from the original program authorized by Portland City Council.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In March, BIKETOWN announced Kaiser Permanente as the program&rsquo;s Official Health Sponsor, the official and sole sponsor of BIKETOWN in the health insurance and health care facility operation category. Kaiser Permanente also joined&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/pricing/group-memberships?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN&rsquo;s group membership</a>&nbsp;program, promoting bike share membership and offering a discount to their employees.</p>

<p class=""gdp"">(Friday, July 21, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) launched its adaptive bicycle rental program today, called <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwNzIxLjc2MTg2OTAxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDcyMS43NjE4NjkwMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTk1Mjk3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;103&amp;&amp;&amp;http://adaptivebiketown.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Adaptive BIKETOWN</a>, the first City-sponsored program of its kind in the nation. An extension of BIKETOWN, Portland&rsquo;s bike share program, Adaptive BIKETOWN is a bike rental service for people with varying abilities and will offer a mix of tandem, hand cycles and three-wheeled bicycles for rent by the hour with the goal of increasing access to cycling.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Adaptive BIKETOWN rental service will be operated by <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwNzIxLjc2MTg2OTAxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDcyMS43NjE4NjkwMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTk1Mjk3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;104&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.albertinakerr.org/KerrBikes/Overview.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Kerr Bikes</a>, which is owned by the non-profit organization <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwNzIxLjc2MTg2OTAxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDcyMS43NjE4NjkwMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTk1Mjk3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;105&amp;&amp;&amp;http://albertinakerr.org?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Albertina Kerr</a>. Kerr Bikes has operated a bike rental service for almost a decade in Portland&rsquo;s Central City to help fund the non-profit organization&rsquo;s programs and services to children and adults with developmental disabilities and mental health challenges. The Adaptive BIKETOWN bicycles will be available for rent at <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTcwNzIxLjc2MTg2OTAxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE3MDcyMS43NjE4NjkwMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MTk1Mjk3JmVtYWlsaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JnVzZXJpZD1oYW5uYWguc2NoYWZlckBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;106&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.albertinakerr.org/KerrBikes/Overview.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Kerr Bikes</a>&rsquo; OMSI location along the Eastbank Esplanade. The rental cost is $5 per hour or three hours for $12 for people with disabilities, seniors and those who qualify for a TriMet honored citizen pass. First-time renters must register in advance for a bike fitting, to ensure that the bikes are properly adjusted for the best ride. Those measurements will be saved, allowing for easy walk in rentals for future rides.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Adaptive BIKETOWN pilot program is a result of more than a year of planning and public input. PBOT staff interviewed individuals about their specific needs, published an online survey that received more than 200 responses, and established a public work group to advise the bureau on the program&rsquo;s development. PBOT provided $30,000 in funding for upfront program costs, including $14,000 for the purchase of 10 bicycles. Nike has contributed an additional $10,000 for ongoing program costs, including raising awareness of Adaptive BIKETOWN.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Portland is already known across the country as a destination for bicycling, and I am proud that we will now be a cycling destination for people of all abilities,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;This program helps everyone experience our city&rsquo;s excellent bicycle network.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Just as BIKETOWN has opened the doors for cycling for people in Portland, I believe that Adaptive BIKETOWN will open those doors even wider,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;As a city we have ambitious goals for getting more people to choose bicycling and other forms of active transportation. The more inclusive we are, the more successful we will be in reaching them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;I am passionate about bicycling. When BIKETOWN launched, I was disappointed that there weren&rsquo;t bikes for me,&rdquo; said Jeremy Robbins, a member of PBOT&rsquo;s Adaptive Bicycle Pilot Project Work Group which helped advise PBOT on the program&rsquo;s development last spring. &ldquo;Working with PBOT and others on developing Adaptive BIKETOWN has been very rewarding. I&rsquo;m very excited for the launch of this historic project.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;We are so proud and excited to offer adaptive cycling options at Kerr Bikes with the help of community partners,&rdquo; said Jeff Carr, CEO of Albertina Kerr. &ldquo;Portland is a great cycling city. For Albertina Kerr to be able to extend our mission by empowering those with disabilities to participate in this program is tremendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;Nike believes in the power of sport to unleash human potential and build community--for all people, of all abilities,&rdquo; said Jorge Casimiro, Nike Vice President of Global Community Impact. &ldquo;This is why we&rsquo;re so excited to support Adaptive BIKETOWN as part of the BIKETOWN program with the City of Portland and the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Adaptive BIKETOWN will give even more Portlanders and visitors an opportunity to enjoy Portland&rsquo;s innovative bike share program and experience the joy of cycling in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The Adaptive BIKETOWN pilot will run through through Fall 2017. Over the winter, PBOT staff will evaluate the program and make any necessary changes or additions ahead of the 2018 season.

<p class=""gd_p"">(July 20, 2017) &ndash; &nbsp;Portland Sunday Parkways presented by Kaiser Permanente is in Northeast Portland&nbsp;this Sunday, July 23rd from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp;It will feature 7.6 miles of traffic-free streets and four City of Portland parks.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This Sunday Parkways coincides with the celebration of BIKETOWN&rsquo;s first anniversary. To mark the occasion and to celebrate Sunday Parkways, Commissioner Saltzman will&nbsp;be joining participants starting at 11 a.m. He will ride a BIKETOWN bike and visit the parks along the route.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This weekend&rsquo;s Sunday Parkways will also feature lots of health-focused fun. Sunday Parkways sponsor Kaiser Permanente has partnered with the nonprofit Community Cycling Center to benefit its Bike Club for kids. Participants can pick up a fun, interactive &lsquo;Passport to Health Sticker Hunt&rsquo; map that takes them to five locations on each Sunday Parkways route to get their stickers. With each completed Passport to Health, participants get a prize and Kaiser Permanente will donate $5 to the Bike Club. Then they can share their achievement and photos on social media with #KPBikeClub.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Our partnership with Portland Sunday Parkways began as an effort to increase the physical activity of our residents to prevent and treat obesity and other chronic diseases,&rdquo; said Molly Haynes, Community Health Director for Kaiser Permanente&rsquo;s Northwest region. &ldquo;Yet, the health benefits of Sunday Parkways extend beyond physical activity into mental health and social connectedness. That&rsquo;s what we want for the children and families in our communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">A valuable community resource, the Community Cycling Center&rsquo;s after-school Bike Club program gives children who don&rsquo;t have access or means to afford a bike on their own a chance to earn their own bike. They also learn safe riding and maintenance techniques, and develop skills in teamwork, problem solving and leadership by working and learning together.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Bikes are transformative for both individuals and communities. Bike Club gives kids the tools they need for bikes to play an important part in their lives, from an actual bike, to the knowledge of how to ride safely and how to keep it safe and functional,&rdquo; said Kasandra Griffin, Executive Director of the Community Cycling Center. &ldquo;Fun, friendship, and confidence are among the additional benefits of this program.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sunday Parkways is the perfect setting for this partnership to benefit Bike Club. &ldquo;People of all backgrounds, ages and abilities can enjoy moving their bodies in a safe and welcoming environment,&rdquo; said Haynes, &ldquo;and giving children an opportunity to learn to love biking and being active fits right in with our mission to improve the total health of the communities we serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Northeast Portland Sunday Parkways route connects neighborhoods from Woodlawn, Alberta, Fernhill and Khunamokwst Parks and travel along Ainsworth and Going streets - low or no-traffic neighborhood greenways, residential streets with low speed limits that are marked with bicycle symbols on the pavement.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The event&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/628206?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">detailed&nbsp;Sunday Parkways route map</a>&nbsp;shows the route as well as bus options to help area residents get to Sunday Parkways via bike and transit. A&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/645748?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">schedule and listing of event highlights</a>&nbsp;are available on the Sunday Parkways Northeast Portland brochure.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sunday Parkways is a series of five free community events opening the city's largest public space &ndash; its streets &ndash; for people to walk, bike, roll and discover active transportation.&nbsp;The event series, held in a different neighborhood once a month from May to September, is hugely popular.</p>

News,650953,News Blog: How it works: PBOT's new two-way bikeway with bike and right-turn signals at NW Naito & Davis,1,,2017-08-14 23:34:55 UTC,2017-08-14 15:00:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(August 14, 2017) This week, PBOT celebrates a new connection for people with the modification of the existing traffic signal at NW Naito &amp; Davis. This bike signal facilitates movement between Better Naito and the Steel Bridge. Located at NW Naito and Davis, the new path and bicycle signal provides people a safe and convenient route to continue south-north. The new bicycle traffic signal makes the right turn onto the Steel Bridge on-ramp more predictable for people driving. The bike signal will allow people on bicycles to safely cross the ramp in either direction when the right turn signal onto the Steel Bridge ramp is red.</p>
<p>This <a href=""/transportation/74266"">new package of improvements</a>, delivered as component of PBOT&rsquo;s <a href=""/transportation/64188"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&rsquo; effort called, provide a connection that reduces conflicts along Tom McCall Waterfront Park and at the Japanese American Historical Plaza, a monument to the Japanese American experience. By providing an adjacent cycling facility, PBOT intends to reduce cut-through bike traffic through Historical Plaza and to encourage bike commuters to take advantage of Better Naito during the busy summer festival season.</p>
<p>The new path was constructed and striped by PBOT Maintenance crews in public right-of-way left over from the old Harbor Drive.</p>

<p><em>Figure 3. After bike path and lane modifications, NW Naito &amp; Davis&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>To prevent conflicts between vehicles and path users, two bike signals were installed by PBOT&rsquo;s Electrical Maintenance staff. After the initial signal is activated and traffic patterns have been observed for a few weeks, City staff will calibrate equipment that detects when people on bicycles are present at the intersection to modify the signal green time, optimizing flow for all users. Northbound right turning vehicles and eastbound vehicles from Davis are held at a red light while the bike signal indication is green, as shown in Figure 4. The bicycle signal heads use a device that allows them to be seen only by the intended (path) users.</p>
<p>Northbound right turning vehicles may proceed right when the right turn signal is green but are prohibited from turning right on red (with a No Turn on Red sign), as shown in Figure 5. The signal is timed to serve different vehicle and bicycle movements appropriately. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Aug. 17, 2017) &ndash; &nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation warns the traveling public to prepare for heavy traffic congestion on area highways and potential delays on public transit this weekend through Tuesday, as the state experiences an influx of visitors for Monday's total solar eclipse.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On Monday, Portlanders should consider telecommuting, working flexible hours, walking, or biking to avoid travel delays. Carpooling can reduce the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing traffic for everyone. <a href=""http://www.portlandstreetcar.org"">Portland Streetcar</a> and <a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/"">BIKETOWN </a>bike share service both plan normal operations.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Local efforts to reduce unnecessary traffic during presidential visits and winter storms have shown Portlanders are able to adjust their travel plans for special circumstances by planning ahead. It's worth remembering to support local businesses as the region copes with the influx of an estimated 1 million visitors to Oregon.</p>

<h2>Be alert! Be respectful!</h2>
<h3>The Portland area will still experience a nearly total eclipse, so make sure you have your eclipse glasses with you but also remember to use caution when traveling, especially around buses and trains.</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whether walking or driving, do not stop or park on train tracks or stand in the street to get a better view.</strong>&nbsp;Be especially careful on rail tracks, as streetcars and light rail vehicles require longer stopping distances. When parked cars impede public transit, it inconveniences thousands of people and could result in your car being towed.</li>
<li><strong>People driving, especially downtown on Monday morning from 9 to 11:30 a.m., should expect crowded sidewalks and heavy pedestrian traffic.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be aware that the rooftop floors of four of PBOT's <a href=""/transportation/35272?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SmartPark garages</a>&nbsp;downtown will be closed during the eclipse to ensure public safety. From 8 p.m. on Sunday through noon on Monday, no vehicle or pedestrian access will be allowed on the roofs of the four garages: 3rd &amp; Alder; 4th &amp; Yamhill; 10th &amp; Yamhill; and 1st &amp; Jefferson. <strong>All other floors of those garages will be available for parking as normal.</strong></li>

<p class=""gd_p"">One of the largest on-street corridors for biking and walking in the United States, and a rare north-south route in Portland, the 20s literally spans the city. It runs from NE Lombard Street near the northern city limits to SE Crystal Springs Blvd, near the southern city limits.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The corridor is designed to meet the needs of novice and advanced cyclists. Two-thirds of the 9 mile route is comprised of neighborhood greenways, the network of&nbsp;residential streets with low traffic volumes and low speeds, where bicycles and pedestrians are given priority.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""The 20s Bikeway makes this North-South corridor and its intersections safer and more convenient for thousands of Portlanders to get where they're going by bike, on foot, or with a mobility device,"" said Saltzman, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. ""When we make our city safer for people using these modes, we make it safer for everyone. I invite all Portlanders to try out the section of the 20s Bikeway closest to your home, business or school.""</p>

""Projects like the 20s Bikeway are essential for us to meet our climate change goals, improve public health and our economy. This project is opening at the perfect time, with school starting back up in the coming weeks across Portland.

<p>A 9-mile route that spans nearly all of Portland in the north-south direction, the 20s Bikeway touches tens of thousands of people, and provides easy biking and walking access to a wide variety of community destinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>More than 35,000 residents, including 5,500 school-aged children live within a quarter mile of the route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It travels through 13 neighborhoods and six business districts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>14 parks and 12 schools are within a quarter mile of the route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It intersects with 14 east-west bikeways, and six more that are planned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The author, Daniel Lerch, who lives here in Portland writes: ""Trying to make our communities less car-dependent simply by adding more buses, streetcars and light rail is like trying to make a bowl of chicken soup vegan simply by picking the chicken out. It's just not that simple,"" he explains.&nbsp;&nbsp;The way&nbsp;our communities are built plays a vital role, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lerch&nbsp;then points to Portland as a model for other cities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Portland, Ore., remains the best American example of this fundamental rethinking, with its vibrant downtown, pioneering light-rail system and strict constraints on suburban sprawl. Portland achieved its successes not by executive fiat, but through decades of work by countless elected officials, planners and community members to forge regional agreement on land use and transportation issues. Car independence has been a central part of the Portland vision, and today the city boasts some of the nation's highest rates of walking and bicycling, despite miserable weather half the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland&nbsp;wasn't always&nbsp;the walkable, bikeable&nbsp;place&nbsp;it is today.&nbsp; Lerch alludes to the long-term process the city continues to work through to change the built environment and our transportation system.&nbsp; The most iconic milepost might be our waterfront's&nbsp;transformation in the 1970s,&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.preservenet.com/freeways/HarborDriveBeforeAfter.jpg"" target=""_blank"">this photo depicts</a>.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/213317

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Just once a week</strong>.&nbsp; Switch just one of&nbsp;my normal&nbsp;driving trips&nbsp;to walking, biking, or transit to make a big difference in my personal and community's health.</p>

</table>
<p>2. <strong>Take the MAX or&nbsp;WES</strong>.&nbsp; Several studies show that train commuters are much more likely to walk 10,000 steps/day.&nbsp; My MAX stop is about 3/4 mile from home; the bus stop less than a 1/4 mile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Log&nbsp;those trips</strong>.&nbsp; A <a href=""/transportation/article/275526"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong>recent study</strong></span></a> shows keeping track of your steps&nbsp;each day is <em>key</em> to maintaining exericse.&nbsp; This works for biking, walking, stairs, etc.&nbsp; Need a free pedometer?&nbsp; You can get one!</p>

<p>4. <strong>Try that neighborhood restaurant</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though my neighborhood isn't considered one of Portland's dining hot spots, there are a bevy of local eateries that I haven't tried yet.&nbsp; And they're all within walking distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <strong>Get smart</strong> (by&nbsp;biking to the library).&nbsp; I love the library, but I don't end up going very often.&nbsp; I plan to change that this year by combining two of my favorite things: bikes and books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <strong>Use transit on the weekend more often</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I rarely drive to work, but on the weekends when I am not heading downtown&nbsp;its usually the car or the bike.&nbsp; Why not transit on the weekends?&nbsp; I am not sure, but I plan on adding the bus and MAX&nbsp;to my weekend mode choices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. <strong>Get more free movies!</strong>&nbsp; I love Movie Madness and West Coast Video, but sometimes I want to save a buck.&nbsp; The library is a great place to get dvds without the fees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. <strong>Walk to the grocery store with the ""kids"".&nbsp;</strong> I have to walk the dogs.&nbsp; I have to get groceries.&nbsp; Combine those two chores into one fun trip.&nbsp; I'll see how I do when the actual human kid comes along...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. <strong>Hit the museums</strong>.&nbsp; What do the Portland Art Museum, Oregon Historical Society, the Children's Museum, and&nbsp;OMSI all have in common?&nbsp;&nbsp;Each one&nbsp;has free or super-discounted&nbsp;admission events each year and they are all easily accessible by transit.&nbsp; Cheap date!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. <strong>Two stops early theorem</strong>.&nbsp; How much more would I walk if I got off the bus two stops early on the way to work and the way home?&nbsp;&nbsp;It would add up to almost a mile each day!&nbsp; That's some good exericisin'!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Aug. 29, 2017) The Portland Bureau of Transportation reminds the traveling public that children across the area are starting a new school year in the coming weeks, starting with Portland Public Schools, the largest school district in the state, on Wednesday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland&rsquo;s five school districts will be back in session on the following days (start dates may vary by campus and grade level):</p>
<ul>
<li>Aug. 30, Portland Public Schools</li>
<li>Sept. 5, Parkrose School District and David Douglas School District</li>
<li>Sept. 6, Centennial School District and Reynolds School District&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all responsible for creating an environment where children can get to school safely, ready and engaged to learn,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT. &ldquo;With summer coming to an end and our city adjusting back to the school year, we urge everyone to travel with caution, especially along our Safe Routes to School and our Neighborhood Greenways and Bikeways.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As student come back to school, it&rsquo;s particularly important to obey traffic laws and drive safely in school zones. Every intersection is a crosswalk, whether it is marked or not, so everyone driving needs to stop for families attempting to cross our streets. Near schools, people driving need to be especially mindful and watch out for parents and children walking and biking.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Just in time for school, PBOT recently installed a new sidewalk in front of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pps.net/Domain/159?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vestal K-8 School</a>&nbsp;at 161 NE 82nd Ave. This new and improved sidewalk will provide kids more space to walk and separate them from the busy traffic on 82nd Avenue. The improvements started with a request from the school community with PBOT's&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/68009?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Sate Routes to School</a>&nbsp;program.</p>

<h2>If you drive to school, through a school zone or in the neighborhoods near a school, follow these safety tips to keep all students safe this year:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obey the 20-mph speed limit in all school zones.</li>
<li>Be patient during drop-off and pick-up if you drive your student to school or drive near a school. The roadways surrounding schools are congested during these times.</li>
<li>Do not idle your vehicle in school zones.</li>
<li>Yield to pedestrians at all intersections, whether marked with a crosswalk or not, it&rsquo;s the law.</li>
<li>Look both ways for pedestrians and bicyclists when turning right on a red light.</li>
<li>Be aware of students where there are no sidewalks along the road and when backing out of driveways.</li>
<li>Watch for younger children &ndash; they can be less predictable and may not cross where you would expect.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Stop and wait for school buses when red lights are flashing.<hr /></li>
</ul>
<h2>If you are walking or biking to school:</h2>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Be aware:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always look both ways before crossing the street</li>
<li>Watch out for truck and busses&rsquo; blind spots</li>
<li>Avoid screens like parked cars when crossing the street</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Be visible:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring a light, reflector or bright clothes when walking or biking particularly when it gets darker.</li>
<li>Make eye contact with drivers before crossing</li>
<li>Whenever possible, cross at signaled/marked intersections when crossing major roads.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Walk or bike in groups!&nbsp; Start a walking school bus or bike train.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;Thanks for doing your part to provide safe student travel near all Portland schools.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Drivers should also be aware that Portland Police Bureau officers will be at every school during the first few weeks of the school year to enforce school speed zones and other traffic laws.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Aug. 30, 2017) &ndash; BIKETOWN for All, the program that provides Portland-area residents living on low incomes with a reduced-cost membership, has introduced significant changes to expand who qualifies for the program and to make it more convenient to sign up for the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Now individuals with an Oregon Trail Card are automatically eligible for BIKETOWN for All. A&nbsp;<a href=""https://pdxtdm.wufoo.com/forms/q1p3xemg0zjtjc7/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">new online registration form</a>&nbsp;also makes it easier and faster to sign up for the program.&nbsp;Along with Oregon Trail Card (EBT card) cardholders, Portlanders who are affiliated with participating affordable housing, social service and non-profit community organizations are also eligible for the program.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;BIKETOWN For All is a great example of Portland&rsquo;s values being seen on the ground in our community,"" said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. ""All Portlanders should have access to our bike share system, and the great partners we have here are making that a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""The more people who use BIKETOWN, the better,"" said PBOT Director Leah Treat. ""That's our mantra and with these new changes, we're taking another significant step in the right direction. We are going to continue to look for innovative ways to expand the benefits of BIKETOWN to all Portlanders.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/pricing/biketown-for-all?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN for All</a>&nbsp;is a partnership between the Community Cycling Center, the Portland Bureau of Transportation, Motivate, the Better Bike Share Partnership, and participating affordable housing communities, social service agencies, and local nonprofits serving Portlanders with low incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN for ALL memberships are $3 per month and include unlimited rides up to 90 minutes per trip.&nbsp;(Full-cost memberships are $12 per month).&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Participants can pay using a credit/debit card or with cash. Card-paying members can sign up immediately by visiting&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.biketownforall.com</a>&nbsp;and clicking the &ldquo;Join BIKETOWN for All Now&rdquo; button.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Cash-paying members can sign up by attending an in-person workshop. The three-hour workshop covers how to use the BIKETOWN bike share system and includes a group ride to teach essential skills for riding a bike in the city. Participants also receive a free helmet. Card-paying members are also welcome to attend these workshops, which are open to the general public. Those interested can visit&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.biketownforall.com</a>&nbsp;for more information. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">BIKETOWN for All is funded by a grant from the Better Bike Share Partnership, as well as an in-kind donation from Motivate, the operator of BIKETOWN and other bike share systems across the country. Motivate is offering up to $54,000 by reducing the cost of 500 annual memberships to $3 per month. BIKETOWN also waives fees for parking BIKETOWN bikes outside of stations for BIKETOWN for All members.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Zoe Kircos of PeopleForBikes, which manages the Better Bike Share Partnership grant program says, ""With these changes to BIKETOWN for ALL, our partners in Portland are helping more people benefit from the ease and convenience of bike share. We are happy to continue supporting these efforts.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Of the current 166 BIKETOWN for All members, over 65% pay in cash. They have ridden over 21,600 miles using BIKETOWN. BIKETOWN for All members have rebalanced over 3,000 bikes, reducing operation costs of manually bring bikes back to stations.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Community Cycling Center has hosted 38 BIKETOWN for All workshops to date. Participating organizations include: Alder House; Harsch Properties; UGM Women and Children; Home Forward; Central City Concern; Street Roots; Native American Rehabilitation Association (NARA); Pacific Towers; Lagunitas; Sisters of the Road; Elders in Action NW; Cascade AIDS Project; Impact NW; and Humboldt Gardens. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Bike share can help reduce barriers to bicycling. A&nbsp;<a href=""http://ppms.trec.pdx.edu/media/project_files/TREC_BreakingBarriersSummaryReport_emQeiBA.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">recent study</a>&nbsp;conducted by PSU researchers that focused on equity in bike share concluded that bike share was well-suited to address many barriers to biking cited by low-income participants. These barriers included lacking a bicycle or being unable to afford one, lacking a safe place to store it at their home or end destination, and concerns related to mechanical troubles with one&rsquo;s bike.</p>

News,654315,News Release: Traffic safety reminders for Labor Day Weekend,1,,2017-09-01 18:31:44 UTC,2017-09-01 18:28:00 UTC,A,Safety tips to combat a growing public health issue,"<p class=""gd_p"">(September 1, 2017) The Labor Day Holiday is a time of celebration. The long weekend is a time to mark the achievements of the labor movement and the unofficial end of summer. We celebrate with barbecues, outdoor recreation, and road trips. But all too often, holidays bring tragedy for those involved in traffic crashes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">During the days surrounding the July 4, 2017 holiday, seven people were killed in seven days on roads in the City of Portland. Those seven people account for nearly a quarter of all deaths on Portland&rsquo;s streets so far in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tragic deaths were all preventable.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71730?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero Action Plan</a>&nbsp;found that 91 percent of deadly crashes in Portland involve impairment, speed, red-light running or other dangerous behaviors. One of our largest challenges is changing human behavior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One traffic death is too many,&rdquo; said Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees the Portland Bureau of Transportation. &ldquo;We urge everyone, especially drivers, to take extra care this holiday so families across Portland can celebrate Labor Day weekend safely.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This summer&rsquo;s traffic deaths show that safety on our roads is a growing public health issue,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The county fully supports the Vision Zero goals to eliminate these preventable deaths and injuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">We are asking everyone in Multnomah County to make safe travel choices this Labor Day Weekend. Specifically:</p>
<p>- Drive at a safe speed - nearly half of Portland's deadly crashes involve people driving at unsafe speeds.<br />- Drive sober - more than half of deadly crashes in Portland involve people who are intoxicated, usually by alcohol.<br />- Drive alert - every three hours, someone in Oregon is injured by a distracted driver. Pull over to text message, make or take a phone call.<br />- Look out for others - people walking and bicycling don&rsquo;t have 3,000 pounds of metal to protect them in a crash.<br />- Buckle up!</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;<strong>FACTS</strong></p>
<p>- Twenty-eight people lost their lives on streets or highways in the City of Portland to date in 2017: more than one third were pedestrians.<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/1b48b5e#_ftn1"">[1]</a><br />- There were 55 traffic deaths in Multnomah County in 2016.<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/1b48b5e#_ftn2"">[2]</a>&nbsp;This compares to an annual average of 41 from 2011 through 2015.<br />- Unintentional injuries, including those from traffic crashes, were the third leading cause of death in Multnomah County in 2015.<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/1b48b5e#_ftn3"">[3]</a><br />- In 2016, 495 people died on Oregon roads, the highest number since 2003.

<p>&ldquo;Washington Park has experienced excellent adoption of Parking Kitty, with nearly 9 percent of all transactions being completed via the app,&rdquo; said Victor Sanders, Program Specialist at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. &ldquo;Visitors to the Park no longer need to cut short a visit when taking their cats to smell the roses at the Rose Garden, finding their cat-like zen at the Japanese Garden or viewing the majestic wild cats at the Oregon Zoo &ndash; they simply add more time using their phone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helping to bring the City of Portland&rsquo;s vision to life through the Parking Kitty application has been enlightening,&rdquo; said Bob Youakim, CEO at Passport. &ldquo;The city has changed the game in how parking can be viewed and used as a tool to improve interactions within the community. It has been an honor to partner with the city on its technology initiatives in a fun and unique way.&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class=""gd_p"">Examples of different types of bike parking currently offered in Portland. Photos by Portland Bureau of Transportation.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Sept. 12, 2017) It&rsquo;s been 20 years since the City of Portland&rsquo;s Bicycle Parking Code was written and adopted. At the time, the city&rsquo;s bicycle commute mode split was only 1.2 percent. Today that number has quadrupled to 7 percent, making Portland the city with the highest bike commute rate among major cities in the United States. With that in mind, the City of Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) has been working with a stakeholder advisory committee for the past year and a half on an&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70439?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">update to the Bicycle Parking Code requirements</a>, in Title 33. The code language regulates the required amount, location, and design of visitor (short-term) and resident/commuter (long-term) bicycle parking spaces for new and redeveloped buildings in Portland. It is our goal that this update will bring our bicycle parking code up to current standards and to help ensure there is adequate, safe and convenient parking for people who ride a bicycle around Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Bicycle Parking Stakeholder Advisory Committee is comprised of representatives from the development community, bicycle advocates, Portland neighborhoods, Transportation Management Associations, and partner City bureaus, including Bureau of Development Services and Bureau of Planning and Sustainability. The committee provides direction and recommendations to the PBOT Director, and subsequently, to other City Bureaus who will write the actual code language during the next phase of the project.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""Adequate, convenient and usable parking for a variety of bikes and cyclists is an important enabler for the higher bicycle mode shares called for in all our key plans,&rdquo; said Chris Smith, a member of the Bicycle Parking Stakeholder Advisory Committee.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Over the last 18 months, the stakeholder advisory committee developed a set of recommendations that will be considered in the formal code update process. These recommendations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the amount of required short- and long-term bicycle parking to align with City goals</li>
<li>Increase flexibility in projects, including: 1) The allowance for reduced spacing for rack placement and inclusion of space-saving rack design and 2) a hierarchy of bicycle parking location standards and guidance</li>
<li>Inclusion of standards to address the usability and accessibility of bicycle racks for all users</li>
<li>Increase long-term bicycle parking security standards</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">If you are interested in diving deeper into the specific details of these recommendations and provide your feedback, visit the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/652368?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Bicycle Parking Online Open House</a>. The open house will be available through Monday, September 25.</p>

The plaque, a gift to the city from the Chinese American Citizens Alliance Portland Lodge, commemorates the contributions of Portland's early Chinese settlers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=655627"" alt=""old chinatown plaque"" width=""640"" height=""439.0625"" /></p>
<p>Between 1863 and 1900, there were over 5,000 Chinese living, working and doing business on SW 2nd Avenue between Taylor and Burnside, the City's original Chinatown. The plaque, designed by urban designer Suenn Ho, recognizes the contributions of these early settlers and memorializes their history for future generations.</p>
<p>""The Chinese American community has a long and storied history in Portland,"" said Commissioner Dan Saltzman. ""The plaque commemorates this rich history and we deeply appreciate this gift to Portland.""</p>

At PBOT, we want these spaces to enhance our neighborhoods and serve our communities,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;So we were very happy to support this project. The plaque is a beautiful way to mark the significant contributions of past generations of Chinese Americans to our city and preserve this rich history for Portlanders and visitors alike.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to quote Alan Spears of National Park Conservation Association who said, &lsquo;The absence of our people in the historical landscape of our country is in itself a civil rights matter,&rsquo; said Helen Ying, Portland Lodge Board Director and Old Town Chinatown Community Association Chair. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are simply elated to gift the bronze plaque to the City and mark the history and contributions of the Chinese American community to Portland."" &nbsp;Betty Jean Lee, Portland Lodge Board Director, added, ""It has taken over a century to finally have the first Chinese community in Oregon documented. Now we can share it with the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The plaque was installed by PBOT Maintenance and Operations personnel and can be seen on the corner of SW 2nd Avenue and Pine Street.</p>

<h2>(SW Main St by bike: See VIDEO from&nbsp;<a href=""https://youtu.be/J0t3cmTJDlY?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PBOT's YouTube Channel</a>)</h2>
<p>(Sept. 15, 2017) Southwest Main Street, a key entrance into downtown Portland for people biking, walking and driving, will get a much-needed face-lift, with construction starting Monday Sept. 18 for a complete rebuild of the pavement and realignment of the bike lane, thanks to the voter-approved Fixing Our Streets Program.</p>
<p>The street improvements will require nighttime road closures and daytime lane closures from Sept. 18 through Oct. 27 on SW Main St, between SW&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Ave and SW Second Ave. Nighttime closures begin on Monday night, Sept. 18. Daytime lane closures begin Thursday, Sept. 21.</p>

<p>Two travel lanes will remain open during daytime hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, but with intermittent closures that only allow one lane open from time to time.&nbsp;This section of SW Main Street normally has two travel lanes, a right-turn lane and a bike lane.</p>
<p>The project will greatly improve a section of failing roadway that serves as a main entrance to downtown Portland from the Hawthorne Bridge. The pavement is cracked, buckling and sagging. People riding bicycles westbound on the bridge, one of the busiest bike routes in North America, find it difficult to navigate the road surface.&nbsp;The road striping has bus and bicycle traffic weaving in the middle of the intersection.</p>
<p>The project will replace the base underneath the road surface and provide new asphalt that will extend the life of the pavement by 15 to 20 years. A concrete bus pad at the transit stop will further ensure the resiliency of the street improvements.</p>
<p>A new bikeway design will provide a bike box to increase visibility of&nbsp;people on bicycles at SW Main and First Ave. It will provide new green striping to highlight areas that are bike only, as well as areas where bike traffic and vehicle traffic intersect. Green boxes will also mark places at intersections where people riding bikes are recommended to change direction.</p>

<p>The Multnomah County Courthouse, Multnomah County Morrison Bridge Closure, and PBOT&rsquo;s Fixing Our Streets Program have been coordinating through the Get Portland Moving effort to limit the effects of construction projects in the right-of-way on the general public.

<p>(Sept. 19, 2017) We are thrilled to unveil the PBOT Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee (BBAC) for fiscal year 2017-2018. BBAC members will inform the bureau&rsquo;s annual transportation budget; review program priorities and infrastructure project lists; and provide input on the strategy and direction for incorporating equity into PBOT&rsquo;s work and engaging communities that PBOT has traditionally underserved.</p>
<p>All City of Portland bureaus are required to have Budget Advisory Committees. These committees provide residents the opportunity to provide important input into the budget priorities of the individual bureaus. In 2015, Director Leah Treat expanded PBOT&rsquo;s own Budget Advisory Committee into the Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee in an effort to offer a more robust avenue for public input year around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PBOT is committed to hearing from a diverse cross section of Portlanders so that we better understand the people we serve and their transportation needs. Our public advisory groups are key venues for us to seek public input and reimagine the future of Portland&rsquo;s transportation system,"" said Director Treat. ""Our policies and programs have become stronger because of the BBAC&rsquo;s engagement and we plan to continue on that path this year. The 2017-2018 committee members represent both the veterans of the transportation world and the next generation of transportation leaders. The diverse mix of experience, backgrounds, areas of expertise, geographic and community affiliations will be a great resource for our upcoming budget and policy discussions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 2017-2018 BBAC will include 5 new members and 13 returning members. BBAC members are appointed by PBOT Director Leah Treat for a one year term and may sit on the committee up to five years.&nbsp;The group includes representatives from PBOT&rsquo;s modal committees (Bicycle Advisory Committee, Pedestrian Advisory Committee and Portland Freight Committee) and representatives from PBOT employee unions.&nbsp;The new members were selected via a competitive application process over the summer. 2017-2018 BBAC member bios are available below.

<p>(Sept. 21, 2017) &ndash; Milwaukie is partnering with the City of Portland Sunday Parkways presented by <a href=""https://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/care-near-oregon-washington"">Kaiser Permanente</a> to open streets and public spaces in the community for people to walk, bike and roll, this Sunday, Sept. 24 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>The <a href=""/transportation/67625"">Sellwood-Milwaukie Sunday Parkways</a> is the final event of the year for Sunday Parkways, which draws thousands of people outdoors, five times a year, for family-friendly fun and exercise.</p>
<p>This cross-border route takes participants through Milwaukie and the Sellwood area of Portland using local transportation amenities, such as the 17th Avenue bike path and Springwater Corridor Trail, as well as city streets. The route highlights a variety of locales in Portland and Milwaukie as well as four major activity areas centered around Water Tower Park at the intersection of SE 40th Avenue and Harvey Street, downtown Milwaukie, and Sellwood and Westmoreland Parks in Portland.</p>
<p>There is no official starting place or direction. Those who would like to join in are invited to connect at any location along the route, and travel in either direction, between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Volunteers and route markers will help ensure participants stay on course.</p>
<p>The activity centers will feature several family-friendly activities, booths from local vendors, a bicycle obstacle course, food, and live music. The downtown Milwaukie location will host food vendors, a beer garden, the Milwaukie Farmers Market, and the main concert stage, in front of City Hall.</p>
<p>PBOT is again partnering with the Salmon Celebration at Westmoreland Park. Local Native tribes and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services will have a salmon bake demonstration (with samples!) drumming, entertainment, and information about how to keep Portland&rsquo;s rivers clean.</p>
<p>During Sunday Parkways, streets along the route will be closed to through traffic, however, local access can be coordinated with intersection and traffic volunteers. Residents who live along the route are encouraged to create their own mini-events in their front yards, driveways or parking lots. Neighbors are welcome to have a party, plan a yard sale, set up a lemonade stand, host live music and other similar activities.</p>
<p>The Sellwood-Milwaukie Sunday Parkways route map shows the event route as well as bus and light rail options to help area residents get to Sunday Parkways via bike and public transit. A schedule and listing of event highlights are available on the online brochure.</p>

Each day we use three modes of transportation not only for our benefit but for the environment as well. Carpooling, MAX and walking. Can't get any better than that!</p>

Linus is a bright lipstick red 3-speed cruiser bike...&nbsp;With Linus, there is no hurry...just a simple, chill ride from meeting to meeting with a fresh spring daffodil in the small vase on the handlebar and a wooden basket to hold my meeting notes and files. Nothing sweeter than Linus.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>Mike</em> -&nbsp;I love riding into work with my sweetheart. The best is when we're on side streets and can ride side by side and chat, just like if we were car commuting. If only my coffee cup was easier to reach.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #fef8d4;"">This week, we are starting with one of our favorite trails (and one of your favorties too, judging by the number of people we share the path with when we're out there).&nbsp; <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;propertyid=679"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #0000ff;""><strong>The Springwater Corridor</strong></span></a><strong>.</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #fef8d4;"">Recently, the trail received some significant upgrades.&nbsp; The ""three bridges project"" allowed the trail to continue over three barriers, the Union Pacific railroad, Johnson Creek, and McLoughlin Blvd.&nbsp; In addition, the trail is slated to receive a new (and much needed) re-paving within the City of Portland.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #fef8d4;"">We are lucky to have such a great trail.&nbsp; And we owe our good fortune, in part, to the old inter-urban streetcars.&nbsp; The Springwater Trail was originally an inter-urban rail line from Sellwood to&nbsp;points east.&nbsp; At one point it strected all the way past Eagle Creek and Estacada to the dam at Cazadero!&nbsp; As was common during the rise of inter-rban rail systems, the rail company built Oak Amusement Park as a way to attract riders on the evenings and weekends.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #fef8d4;"">The Springwater Line stopped carrying passengers in 1958 and the entire rail infrastructure was removed in 1989.&nbsp; The Oregon Department of Transportation acquired the right-of-way and transferred&nbsp;the rights to the City of Portland.&nbsp; In 1996 the trail opened in Portland.&nbsp; Since that time, Metro and the&nbsp;cities of Portland,&nbsp; Gresham and Milwaukie have worked to add more sections and upgrade the trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #fef8d4;"">A vision exists to&nbsp;extend the trail all the way to the Mt. Hood National Forest and the Pacific Crest Trail.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be quite a bike ride!</span></p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(September 29, 2017) After a successful summer of Better Naito, Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) crews will begin removing the two-way bikeway and pedestrian path this weekend.&nbsp;<strong>Come Monday, October 2 Naito&rsquo;s standard configuration will return, with two northbound vehicular lanes and one standard bike lane.</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Every year the festivals in Tom McCall Waterfront Park draw hundreds of thousands of people. The Better Naito project was first piloted in 2015 to help manage this influx of visitors, create a safe space for people to travel to these events, and reduce conflicts between people walking and biking and driving along the Waterfront. The success of the volunteer-led effort championed by the non-profit Better Block PDX caught the attention of Portland City Council. After two seasons of volunteer-led effort, Council designated $350,000 to PBOT to implement Better Naito for five seasons.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">October 2 marks the end of PBOT&rsquo;s first season spearheading the project. Throughout the summer, PBOT staff worked to improve upon the project and related Naito safety efforts, including installing a permanent new pedestrian crossing at SW Naito and Main and a new bike and right turn signal at NW Naito and Davis. Staff monitored bicycle and pedestrian usage throughout the season, as well as northbound vehicle traffic and travel times.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">By all markers, the season was a success, serving thousands of people walking and biking with minor travel time impacts to people driving in the northbound lane. Better Naito saw twice the cycling rates of the Waterfront Path, reducing conflicts with pedestrians. During peak afternoon traffic hours 1 in 3 northbound commuters were on bike. Travel times for people driving northbound were consistent with previous summers, with trips taking about one minute longer than without Better Naito. And with the addition of Better Naito, Naito Parkway was not just for people driving or biking - over a thousand people walked in the facility on the average non-event day. During events, usage was even higher. On July 3, during Waterfront Blues Fest, over 15,000 people used Better Naito in a 24-hour period.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Check out the attached infographic for more fun facts and data. PBOT will issue a more detailed report on Better Naito later this fall.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Oct. 4, 2017) New Portland Public Schools Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero and PBOT Assistant Director Chris Warner today joined local leaders and advocates, as well as students and parents from Jason Lee K-8 School in NE Portland for a walk to school in celebration of International Walk + Roll to School Day. This annual event, celebrated by students around the globe, is an opportunity for families to see firsthand how fun, easy and safe walking, biking or rolling to school can be for students.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Every weekday, close to 65,000 school kids traverse Portland&rsquo;s streets to get to school. PBOT&rsquo;s nationally recognized&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.saferoutesportland.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Safe Routes to School</a>&nbsp;program helps to ensure that they arrive safely. A partnership between the City of Portland, schools, neighborhoods, community organizations and public agencies, Safe Routes to School serves more than 100 Portland schools in five school districts. The program combines educational outreach and targeted street and signal safety improvements along the routes Portland&rsquo;s kids use to get to school. The goal is to encourage students and their families to get to school in ways that are active, reduce traffic, increase safety and contribute to a cleaner environment. Since 2006, the program has increased walking and biking to Portland schools by 35 percent.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/10/1579804/1549260/guerrero-pps-100417_crop.jpg"" alt=""Guadalupe Guerrero, new superintendent of Portland Public Schools"" hspace=""7"" width=""208"" height=""156"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/64188?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>, the locally funded street repair and traffic safety program approved by Portland voters in May 2016, will invest $8 million to make routes to Portland schools safer and more convenient for kids to walk and bike to school. Project installations on primary investment routes are expected to begin in the summer of 2018. In addition, the statewide Safe Routes to School Program will have $10 million a year, growing to $15 million a year in 2022 as a result of the new transportation package passed by the state legislature last session. Portland will be able to compete for grants to build sidewalks, crosswalks and bike lanes that make it safer for families to bike and walk to school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The benefits of active transportation are well known, but there are also well known barriers to why students might not take part, including safety factors,&rdquo; said Guerrero, who started with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.pps.net/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Public Schools</a>&nbsp;on Monday. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why PPS supports Safe Routes to School, which works hard to help every student gain all the educational and health benefits of walking or riding a bike to school.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;As a parent, I know how important it is to have a safe route to school,&rdquo; said PBOT Assistant Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;We are grateful to Portland voters and the state legislature for prioritizing safety for kids in Portland and across all of Oregon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s inspiring to witness the progress we&rsquo;re making in encouraging more kids to get around&nbsp;using active transportation,&rdquo; said LeeAnne Fergason,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.thestreettrust.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">The Street Trust</a>&rsquo;s deputy director. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re&nbsp;so grateful for the Oregon Department of Transportation, Metro, and cities who fund these&nbsp;invaluable programs. Together with school staff, parents, and students, we can raise a new&nbsp;generation of commuters with a lifelong passion for walking and bicycling.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><a href=""/transportation/68009?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Safe Routes to School</a>&nbsp;works with communities within five school districts in the city: Portland Public,&nbsp;Parkrose, David Douglas, Centennial, and Reynolds.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">International Walk and Bike to School Day is a global event that involves communities from more than 40 countries walking and biking to school on the same day. It began in 1997 as a one-day event. The event has become part of a movement for year-round safe routes to school and a celebration each October. Today, thousands of schools across America &nbsp;&ndash; from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico &ndash; and around the world participate every October.</p>

<p>(October 5, 2017) Portland&rsquo;s bike lanes just got a little more colorful, thanks the hard work of PBOT&rsquo;s striping crews who prepared and installed the winning designs from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketobooks.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Bikes to Books coloring contest</a>&nbsp;in bike lanes around the city.</p>
<p>This past May, PBOT and Multnomah County Library, with support from Metro, invited students living in Multnomah County from Pre-Kindergarten to 12th Grade to design bike lane art for&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73492?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bike to Books&rdquo; Bike Month coloring contest</a>. For years Portlanders have enjoyed the smile-inducing bike lane art designed by PBOT&rsquo;s striping crews. The designs are created by crew members and can be found in bike lanes and on neighborhood greenways across the city.</p>

The final step was for PBOT&rsquo;s striping crews to prepare and install the designs on Portland streets. Final design locations were chosen based on their proximity to the winning artist&rsquo;s local Multnomah County Library branch.</p>

<p>We asked contest winner Chloe Unflat, a sophomore at Wilson High School, Hillsdale Library volunteer and first place winner in the high school category, about her experience participating in the Bike to Books contest:</p>
<p><strong>Why did you enter the contest?</strong></p>
<p>I entered the contest because I volunteer at the Multnomah County Library each summer for the summer reading program and heard about the contest through there! I thought it would be a fun thing to do, and took an afternoon working on the design.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What was the inspiration for your design?</strong></p>
<p>I chose to use the Portland flag in my design because whenever I think about biking, the Portland culture is at the heart of it. Many if my friends bike to school and work, and I love to go on bike rides with my family to explore our city. The Portland flag summed that all up for me.</p>
<p><strong>Do you bike?</strong></p>
<p>I love to bike, even though I don't do it too often. During the summer, I love going on rides over the bridges and sometimes to&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.portlandsundayparkways.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Sunday Parkways</a>&nbsp;with our family friends. It's super fun and I wish I had more opportunities to get out and ride.</p>
<p><strong>What does Portland&rsquo;s bike lane art mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>I really had no idea that Portland bike lane art was something to think about until this contest. But after looking a previous designs that others have done, and the winners of this year, I think that it's a great way to get people to be aware of our love of biking and enjoy something special in their ride.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the designs are now installed and ready to be discovered on your next ride to the library! Enjoy!</p>

News,658949,PBOT Traffic Advisory: Intersection of SW Main St & SW First Ave to close this weekend for street improvements,1,,2017-10-17 13:49:03 UTC,2017-10-13 01:03:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=658951"" alt=""SW Main St progress 10-12-17"" width=""662"" height=""496"" /></p>
<p><em>As of Thursday Oct. 12, crews have made progress on rebuilding SW Main Street between SW First Ave and SW Second Ave. A complete rebuild of the pavement and realignment of the bike lane are in progress, thanks to the voter-approved Fixing Our Streets Program. (Photo by Dylan Rivera, Portland Bureau of Transportation.)</em></p>
<p>(Oct. 12, 2017) Southwest Main Street, a key entrance into downtown Portland for people biking, walking and driving, is getting a facelift that will require the closure of the intersection of SW Main St and SW First Ave this weekend.</p>
<p>The intersection will be closed from 7 p.m. on Friday Oct. 13 to midnight Sunday night.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/64188""><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=658953"" alt=""Fixing Our Streets logo"" width=""213"" height=""239"" /></a></p>
<p>Westbound traffic on the Hawthorne Bridge will be directed to make a left turn, going south in the slip lane at SW First Ave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is advised to use alternate routes and expect delays in the area this weekend. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all signage and directions by reader boards and flaggers.</p>
<p>This work is weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>
<p>Intermittent daytime lane closures resume after 9 a.m. on Monday Oct. 16, through Oct. 27 on SW Main St, between SW First Ave and SW Second Ave.</p>
<p>The project will greatly improve a section of failing roadway that serves as a main entrance to downtown Portland from the Hawthorne Bridge. The pavement is cracked, buckling and sagging. The roadway is being completely rebuilt.</p>
<p>People riding bicycles westbound on the bridge, one of the busiest bike routes in North America, find it difficult to navigate the road surface. A new bikeway design will provide a bike box to increase visibility of people on bicycles at SW Main St and SW First Ave.</p>
<p>Funding for the reconstruction and bicycle safety improvements comes from the <a href=""/transportation/64188"">Fixing Our Streets</a> program, which results from the voter approved Measure 26-173. In May 2016, Portland voters approved the measure, which provides a 10-cent tax on motor vehicle fuels and Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to street repair and traffic safety projects.</p>
<p>The Multnomah County Courthouse, Multnomah County Morrison Bridge Closure, and PBOT&rsquo;s Fixing Our Streets Program have been coordinating through the<a href=""/transportation/72755""> Get Portland Moving</a> effort to limit the effects of construction projects in the right-of-way on the general public.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(October 24, 2017) This past summer,&nbsp;<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/www.pbotblockparty.com"">PBOT&rsquo;s Block Party Program</a>&nbsp;conducted a pilot project for the neighborhoods east of 82nd Avenue and Cully. The pilot area included thirteen Portland neighborhoods which historically had low participation in block party permits. Thanks to&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71710?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PBOT&rsquo;s Livable Street Strategy&nbsp;</a>development this past year, permit barriers in this area of Portland were identified and removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After looking at historical data, the bureau discovered that areas of the city had a pattern of under-participation in the Block Party Program. As part of PBOT's overall equity mission to bring PBOT programs to under-served&nbsp;communities, the Block Party team organized a pilot program with the goal of increasing participation.&nbsp;PBOT endeavored to relieve some of the barriers by creating an online application, translating documents into five languages, eliminating permit fees and offering free use of our pink &ldquo;street closed barricades&rdquo; available within the pilot area at various community centers. PBOT staff also participated in outreach to promote the project at many community events including Sunday Parkways, APANO Night Market and Oregon Walks Lents Founders Fair.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The pilot project it was an incredible success. PBOT issued four times as many block party permits in East Portland than in previous years. A follow up survey&nbsp;(with over a 55% survey response rate)&nbsp;with the participating permittees has revealed some compelling stories. Here are some of the survey results:</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Most block party permittees were first-time applicants who had always wanted to participate in the permitting program. Said one survey response, &ldquo;Before this event, many of the people in the neighborhood had not met. The block party provided a safe, open, casual, and fun space for people to interact. Several of the attendees expressed their previous desire for this kind of thing, and everyone seemed really happy that it finally happened.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">One family in Cully had never seen or met some neighbors despite having lived on the same street for 14 years, noting that they wish they could have one every month but that they would surely hold another block party next year: &ldquo;I meant to do it every month but personally couldn&rsquo;t pull it off with my schedule &ndash; more people wanted to join in for the next one, so we will definitely do it again next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/10/1612388/1579529/2017-survey-wordle-v1_crop.jpg"" alt=""survey responses"" width=""538"" height=""219"" /></p>

<p>Overall, participants felt that the block party was a unifying event that brought about a sense of community and resilience.&nbsp; One organizer said, &ldquo;Many were initially skeptical and fearful, but it turned out very well, and people want to do it again next year. Others who didn't come said they would next year. [Our block party] really brought us all together!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Attendance numbers were moderate to high; one first-time block party in Mill Park had approximately 75 attendees.&nbsp; In Hazelwood, an August block party brought nearly eighty people together in a quintessential summer scene: &ldquo;It was fabulous for us to get together and get acquainted. We must have had about 40 children and almost as many adults. We BBQed hot dogs and had a potluck. We rented a bouncy bounce. A unit of the fire department paid us a visit so the children could see the fire truck up close and personal. It was a wonderful event.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Oct. 31, 2017) Citing lessons learned from last year&rsquo;s record winter, Mayor Ted Wheeler and Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman announced new steps the City of Portland is taking to be ready for this coming winter. Joined by officials for the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), Mayor Wheeler and Commissioner Saltzman also reminded Portlanders of what they can do to make sure they are prepared for winter travel.</p>
<p>Some of the most severe in decades, last year&rsquo;s winter storms caused significant disruptions to the City&rsquo;s transportation system, led to numerous school cancellations and had a negative impact on residents and the local economy. At the direction of Commissioner Saltzman, PBOT developed a new set of procedures and policies based on lessons learned during last winter. The goals outlined today are to improve the City&rsquo;s winter storm response and better help Portlanders get from place to place safely during and after winter storms.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image content-left"" style=""width: 330px; height: 247px; float: left; border-width: initial; border-style: none;"" src=""http://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/12/1134676/1589344/snow-zone-sign-w-burnside_crop.jpg"" alt=""Snow Zone sign West Burnside"" hspace=""7"" width=""330"" height=""247"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>""We learned a lot of lessons last year, and we are doing everything we can to keep our roads usable and keep people safe during inclement weather this year,"" Mayor Wheeler said. ""I&rsquo;d also like to focus on a second set of lessons we learned last winter. And that is that most of us are unprepared for severe winter weather. Everyone who has a car should have snow chains in your trunk, so you will have them in an emergency. Know how to avoid driving entirely, by planning to telecommute or take public transit in severe weather.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We understand full well the expectations the public has for service during extreme winter events and the impact these events have on their lives and livelihoods,&rdquo; Commissioner Saltzman said. &ldquo;We have learned a great deal from the snow, ice and landslides of 2016-2017. We&rsquo;ve stepped up our response and our coordination with other agencies. And we expect the public to prepare themselves to do their part to help us get through this winter together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Approximately 1,750 lane miles of Portland&rsquo;s streets are on the City&rsquo;s anti-icing and plow routes. PBOT officials noted that their goal for plowing these streets was one lane clear and passable in each direction as soon as possible after a storm event. Passable is defined as drivable for a front-wheel drive vehicle or a vehicle with traction devices.</p>
<p>Among key steps the City will take this winter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expanded use of road salt.</strong>&nbsp;Last winter, PBOT piloted the use of road salt, first with the City of Seattle's supply and later with 100 tons bought by PBOT. Based on the success of this pilot, the bureau has purchased new supplies of salt and formulated a Winter Weather Salt Plan to guide its use as a snow and ice fighting tool. PBOT now has 300 tons on hand, and storage capacity for up to 1,300 tons.</li>
<li><strong>New equipment and more drivers.</strong>&nbsp;With money from the City&rsquo;s General Fund, the City has purchased snowplow blades to be installed on PBOT and Water Bureau trucks. In addition, Water Bureau personnel have been cross-trained to drive snowplows and will be able to assist regular PBOT plow drivers.</li>
<li><strong>Agreements with contractors.&nbsp;</strong>To further boost snow fighting capacity, the City has agreements with 10 private contractors for snow removal services.</li>
<li><strong>Chain requirements.</strong>&nbsp;In response to multiple cars being abandoned on key travel and emergency routes, the City will again require chains or other traction devices on West Burnside and Sam Jackson Park Road which dramatically reduced the number of abandoned cars after being implemented early this year.</li>
<li><strong>Helping schools and businesses with expanded anti-icing.</strong>&nbsp;During the 2016-17 winter season, the City added the Central Business District to its anti-icing routes. It also began to treat high priority areas identified by the City&rsquo;s local school districts. PBOT will continue this expanded service this winter.</li>

<div><em><span class=""gd_p"">SW Terwilliger and Taylors Ferry on a rainy afternoon.</span></em></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 7, 2016) - Daylight savings time ended on Sunday, so it&rsquo;s time to step up your visibility and make sure you&rsquo;re doing your part to travel with care.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">People driving can increase visibility by using their headlights, leaving a safe distance between vehicles to increase your cone of vision, and continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling. Always be alert and practice extra caution during winter&rsquo;s rain and low light.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Drivers need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to practice patience and slow down</li>
<li>Stay in your lane and beware of drivers who dart from lane to lane</li>
<li>Even though the route may be familiar, don't go on autopilot; stay alert and ALWAYS watch for vulnerable road users such as people walking, biking and rolling</li>
<li>Don't touch your phone, eat, drink or do other things that are distracting.&nbsp;Remember, as of October 1, 2017 it is illegal to drive while holding or using an electronic device (i.e. a cell phone or tablet).</li>
<li>Slow down at crosswalks and take care when making turns &ndash; even at a signal.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">Did you know that as we age we have greater difficulty seeing at night? Night vision is the ability to see well in low-light conditions. A 50-year-old driver may need twice as much light to see as well as a 30-year-old.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Depth perception, color recognition and peripheral vision can be compromised in the dark for all drivers, and the glare of headlights from an oncoming vehicle can significantly impact a driver&rsquo;s vision.&nbsp; Even with high-beam headlights on, visibility is limited creating less time to react to something in the road, especially when driving at higher speeds.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">People walking and biking can increase their visibility during low-light hours by wearing reflective gear and using safety lights.&nbsp; When walking, keeping a small flashlight or using the feature on your phone is another helpful way to make sure you can see at night.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Did you know that you&rsquo;re first visible to people driving from 500 feet away when you&rsquo;re wearing reflective clothing? Compare this to just 55 feet away when wearing dark colors with no reflective gear or lights.</p>

News,662530,"PBOT News Release: Portland prohibits sale of hazardous recreational vehicles, offers free turn-in day for proper disposal",1,,2017-11-07 21:29:44 UTC,2017-11-07 21:28:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Oct. 5, 2017) To address a growing public health and neighborhood livability concern, the Portland City Council on Wednesday voted to ban the sale of hazardous recreational vehicles. The City will also offer to dispose of recreational vehicles for free for Portland residents at a first-ever RV Disposal RV Turn-In Day on Oct. 29.</p>
<p>With the emergency ordinance passed unanimously by City Council, Portlanders who sell, lease, donate or give away an RV that leaks waste water or fuel may be fined $500 or subject to six months in jail, or both. The ordinance does not apply to sales of RVs to licensed repair facilities or dismantlers.</p>
<p>The hazardous RV ordinance, which may be unprecedented on the West Coast, comes in response to growing public concern about derelict RVs on city streets. The Portland Bureau of Transportation received 4,000 complaints about derelict or abandoned RVs parked in public right-of-way in 2016. So far this year, PBOT has received nearly 7,000 such complaints. PBOT has towed 156 abandoned RVs this year. Portland Police have towed another 100 RVs that were occupied and posing a public safety hazard.</p>
<p><br />Portland residents, PBOT parking enforcement officers and Portland Police have observed RVs leaking raw sewage or fuel, as well as instances when RV owners were dumping sewage onto public streets and storm drains.</p>
<p>""Portlanders are justifiably concerned by the growing public health and safety threat posed by abandoned or derelict RVs on our streets,"" Mayor Ted Wheeler said. ""Portland Police have been working closely with transportation staff to address this issue and this ordinance and turn-in day will help catch unsanitary RVs before they get to our streets and become a problem for our community.""</p>
<p>Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT, sponsored the ordinance, along with Mayor Wheeler.</p>
<p>""Every week, I hear from Portlanders who are concerned about derelict or abandoned RVs,"" Saltzman said. ""This ordinance will help us keep the worst of the worst RVs off our streets, to protect the environment and public health.""</p>
<p>The new approach may also save money. The cost of removing abandoned and derelict RVs from city streets has been rising and is expected to cost more than $1.3 million in the 2017-18 fiscal year. Preventing RVs from being abandoned would prevent the City from paying the cost of enforcement and removal.</p>
<p>FREE RV Disposal Turn-In Day</p>
<p>Working with Portland Police and Metro, PBOT will offer its first-ever opportunity for Portland residents to dispose of their older RVs free of charge. Owners must make an appointment online for the Turn-In Day, which will be held Oct. 29 at Portland International Raceway.</p>
<p>The Turn-In Day event is intended to address the disposal cost of older RVs, which is a barrier to people who no longer want to own the vehicles. It can cost an RV owner $1,000 to $2,000 to properly dispose of an older vehicle, because of the expertise required to dispose of water and waste water systems and other parts. Many older RVs are worth less than the cost of proper disposal.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide the public a way to dispose of unwanted RVs.</p>
<p>The Turn-In Day is only available to residents of Portland who are the registered owner of the vehicle. Learn more and make an appointment online.</p>

<p class=""x_gd_p"">Ted Miller, ODOT&rsquo;s Portland area maintenance and operations manager, said getting ready for winter may involve preparing for things that don&rsquo;t happen. But, he said, everyone, ODOT and the public at large, need to do their part when bad weather hits.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&ldquo;Are you ready to go?&rdquo; Miller asked. &ldquo;Do you have your snow tires mounted, chains fitted, and emergency kits ready? Are you ready to make plans to take alternate transportation to work, telecommute, rideshare? We want you to be prepared by watching the local news, going to&nbsp;[www.tripcheck.com]tripcheck.com, and calling 511 to check conditions on your route. Please be prepared for the worst and those things you worry about maybe won&rsquo;t happen anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">WSDOT Maintenance Supervisor Aaron Yanez said the public needs to be prepared, especially when traveling on area highways.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&ldquo;Interstates 5 and 205 are our priority routes in the Vancouver area,&rdquo; said WSDOT Maintenance Supervisor Aaron Yanez. &ldquo;If there is a need to travel with snow or ice in the forecast, those behind the wheel should be prepared and drive for the conditions.&rdquo;</p>

PBOT reminds residents in Leaf Service Zone NW 2 that cars left on street during Leaf Day service will be towed,1,,2017-11-22 23:09:04 UTC,2017-11-22 20:14:00 UTC,A,,"<h2>Cars in Leaf Zone NW 2 must be off the street between 7:30 am and 10:30 am on Monday, November 27th</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Nov. 22, 2017) &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;Residents in Leaf Zone NW 2 should make sure their vehicles are off the street during the zone's Leaf Day service on Monday, November 27th&nbsp;from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. &nbsp;Vehicles parked in marked ""no parking"" zones will be towed at the owner's expense. The boundaries of NW 2 are:&nbsp;NW Wilson Street to the north, NW 29th Avenue to the west, NW Northrup Street to the south, and NW 25th Avenue to the east.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT tows vehicles in Leaf Day service zones where neighborhood leaders have requested the bureau to tow vehicles to facilitate&nbsp;a more effective leaf pickup service. Areas with towing include Northwest Portland, Goose Hollow in Southwest Portland and Sullivan's Gulch in Northeast Portland. Anyone who parks a car on the street in Leaf Day service zones with towing -- whether they live, work or shop there -- needs to be on the lookout for ""no parking"" signs. In advance of the Thanksgiving holiday, PBOT is posting ""no parking"" signs today in Leaf Service&nbsp;Zone NW 2, which will be swept on Monday, Nov. 27. A PBOT Public Information Officer will be on site on Monday morning to share information with the news media.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This year, PBOT is offering text message reminders of Leaf Day service in areas where we tow vehicles. Residents are invited to sign up at&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/subscribe?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/subscribe</a>.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">Here are the scheduled dates for Leaf Day zones where vehicles are towed because of neighborhoods' interest in providing the cleanest sweep possible. Most are in Northwest Portland. To reduce the impact to the public, parking restrictions are limited to three hours in Northwest Portland, 7:30 to 10:30 a.m.</p>
<ul>
<li>Monday, November 27 - NW 2</li>
<li>Wednesday, November 29 - NW 7, NW 9</li>
<li>Friday, December 1 - SW 1, SW 2</li>
<li>Monday, December 4 - NW 6, NW 8</li>
<li>Wednesday, December 6 - NW 3, NW 4</li>
<li>Friday, December 8 - NE 14</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">Any cars on the street during Leaf Day in these neighborhoods will be towed at their owners' expense.&nbsp;The current contractual cost of a tow is $179. The cost to store a towed vehicle past the initial four hours is $27 per day.&nbsp;To locate your vehicle, call Police Auto Records at 503-823-0044.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">View our&nbsp;<a href=""http://arcg.is/2AhHTQQ?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">interactive Leaf Day map</a>&nbsp;to see details of service dates and zone boundaries. Zone numbers that say ""clean sweep"" on the pop up details are areas where we call tow trucks if you are parked on a block where ""no parking"" signs are posted. For example, NW 3 is labeled&nbsp;Northwest 3 (Inner West Clean Sweep).</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">Live or work in a Leaf Zone?</h2>
<h2 class=""content-center"">Check your Leaf Day brochure for more details</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">Each year, PBOT sends&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/411339?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Leaf Day brochures</a>&nbsp;to thousands of addresses in leaf zones. Those brochures include maps and information about towing in areas where we call for towing to get the most effective sweep possible.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">From mid-November to mid-December, removing leaves from our streets is critical because letting them stay&nbsp;on the street can clog storm drains, flood intersections&nbsp;and make streets slippery. Our Leaf Day Pickup program is about getting the leaves cleaned up in a way that makes a better, healthier and safer Portland.</p>

News,664982,"News Blog: A primer on congestion pricing, why Portland doesn't plan to build any new freeways, and benefits for low-income commuters",1,,2018-03-07 23:01:10 UTC,2017-12-01 21:53:00 UTC,A,"Follow up on City Council meeting of Nov 30, 2017","<p>(Dec. 1, 2017) Many people on Twitter were intrigued by the Portland City Council conversation Nov. 30, 2017 about adding variable priced tolls to area roadways. Some wondered why Mayor Ted Wheeler would say the City will not build any new freeways. Others wondered specifically about the statement by Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson that affluent people drive more than people living on low incomes.</p>
<p>Here's some data and background on both points.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mayor Ted Wheeler:</strong></h3>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious to everybody that we live in a region that&rsquo;s abundant with natural beauty and resources. We&rsquo;re seeing that our economy is vibrant and continues to grow. One of the side effects of that good news is that we&rsquo;re also seeing significant growth in congestion on our roadways. These same factors make Portland such a wonderful place to live, work and recreate but they also attract new residents. That of course includes increased housing and increased pressure on our roadways.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>While I am mayor, I want to be clear, we&rsquo;re not building any more freeways in the City of Portland. Congestion pricing not only funds and maintains our transportation system, but also is a very effective tool for managing the traffic that will continue as Portland grows and changes. We also can&rsquo;t lose sight of the impact traffic emissions have on our public health and our overall environment. Air quality has been and will continue to be a key issue for me as mayor. We can&rsquo;t deny that vehicles continue to be a source of pollution in the air we breathe. Today&rsquo;s resolution is not only a statement of our values &ndash; advancing our community&rsquo;s health, protecting our environment and achieving our equity goals &ndash; it is also a path forward to better achieve these goals.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3><strong>Multnomah County Commissioner Jessica Vega Pederson:</strong></h3>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">""Congestion pricing can have benefits for both people who drive and people who use transit. And most importantly for me, it can have benefits for low-income residents as well.&nbsp;</span>While tolls could be regressive, not all low-income people drive. Many low-income people don&rsquo;t own cars, so tolls may not hurt the most vulnerable and may even help them, if reduced traffic congestion lets buses travel faster, improves frequency and expands bus lines &ndash; all of which should be part of a successful congestion pricing plan.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">For the many low-income people who do drive, tolls may burden them, but tolls can generate revenue that we can use to offset costs for those low-income drivers.</span></em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">What we don&rsquo;t want to do is to assume that the current system of free roads benefits everyone equally. It doesn&rsquo;t. Driving is expensive. It requires a car, gas, insurance, maintenance, registration fees, the list goes on. That&rsquo;s why the affluent drive much more than the poor and take more advantage of our current road system.</span></em></p>

<div><span class=""gd_p"">An illustration of the ""Stretch"" bridge design option for Sullivan's Crossing facing west over I-84.</span></div>
<p class=""gd_p"">By David Backes, Portland Bureau of Transportation</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(Dec. 1, 2017) In 2021, a new bridge will reach across I-84, connecting the Lloyd District with the Central Eastside Industrial District. Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing (as it&rsquo;s called now) will allow people to stroll and roll separate from motor vehicle traffic, all while taking in stunning views of downtown Portland. In the event of a major earthquake, Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing&rsquo;s robust engineering will also allow it to remain functional and provide access for emergency vehicles.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This stress-free biking and walking route between the two growing districts provides a much-needed connection across the natural barrier of Sullivan&rsquo;s Gulch and human-made barriers below, I-84 and the Union Pacific Railroad. Today, people driving between the two districts have several nearby options (Grand, MLK, 12th Avenue), but safe, comfortable options for people biking and walking are limited. Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing bridges that gap, while also completing a key link in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/greenloop/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Green Loop</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/12/1677362/1642789/sullivan_crop.png"" alt=""Green Loop map"" width=""549"" height=""450"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Determining the south landing location &ndash; 7th or 8th Avenue</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The north side landing of Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing is NE 7th Avenue, due to its existing bike lanes and through connection to NE Lloyd Boulevard. On the south side, the bridge will either land at NE 8th Avenue &amp; NE Glisan Street (Alignment 1) or NE 7th Ave &amp; NE Flanders Street (Alignment 2). Both alignment alternatives have been studied, and both have advantages and tradeoffs&mdash;see below for a high-level overview (and for a more detailed look&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/585792?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">download the full report here</a>).</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The final alignment decision will be made in December, following further analysis, conversations with stakeholders, and feedback received at the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/146674146058988/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">open house.</a></p>

<li>Shorter span is less expensive to build (+)</li>
<li>PBOT would need to acquire right of way (-)</li>
<li>Sightlines of the bridge from the south side are not as continuous as with 7th (-)</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>NE 7th Avenue Alignment Snapshot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Longer span is more expensive to build (-)</li>
<li>PBOT owns more right of way here and would not need to acquire property (+)</li>
<li>Likely better sightlines of the bridge from the south side (+)</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Exploring different bridge types</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">It isn&rsquo;t possible to fully vet bridge types until an alignment alternative has been selected, but preliminary assessment of bridge types has already begun. In 2016, PBOT worked with consultants to prepare an alternatives analysis of different bridge types and alignments. From this analysis, one preferred bridge type emerged, which is now being compared to additional options.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Models of these bridge types are shown below as conceptual examples of what the new crossing might look like.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Join us at the open house to see the models and learn more about the project on Tuesday, December 5, 2017 from 4:00 &ndash; 6:30 p.m. (drop in anytime) at Oregon Metro, 2nd floor lobby (600 NE Grand Ave, 97232).

<p class=""gd_p"">Here are the bridge designs being considered for Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing (all designs are looking eastbound up I-84, away from downtown Portland):</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>1. &ldquo;Stretch&rdquo; expresses the asymmetry of the site by taking advantage of the embankment on the north side of the alignment:</strong></p>

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>3. &ldquo;Reach&rdquo; is iconic in its tower expression, serving as a gateway marker for both entering and leaving the City of Portland:</strong></p>

<p class=""gd_p""><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>4. &ldquo;Leap&rdquo; takes advantage of the ability to anchor into the northern embankment to create an expressive truss structure that seems to spring from the ground:</strong></p>

<p>(Dec. 4, 2017) The Portland chapter of the Women&rsquo;s Transportation Seminar (WTS) International is pleased to announce the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.parkingkitty.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Parking Kitty</a>&nbsp;as the 2017 WTS Innovative Transportation Solution award winner. The Parking Kitty project team will be honored at the Portland Chapter&rsquo;s 32nd Anniversary Winter Gala at the Downtown Portland Embassy Suites on December 7, 2017 at 5:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Innovative Transportation Solution award is given to a project with notable leadership and involvement by women that has been particularly innovative from initiation to completion. The Parking Kitty mobile app gives Portlanders the option to pay for parking with their mobile phones. The multi-faceted initiative, which included developing a new system and protocols to integrate the mobile parking app into Portland&rsquo;s parking enforcement program, creating a strong brand identity and a marketing and communications campaign to bring the app to Portlanders, was led entirely by women.</p>
<p>The successful launch of Parking Kitty in May 2017 led to a six percent adoption rate of the app by the end of August. Parking transactions using the app rose from six percent in August to over 13 percent by mid-November, following the release of the<a href=""https://youtu.be/W4Hxewc_64M?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">&nbsp;Parking Kitty rap and music video</a>&nbsp;starring Portland artist&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.iammoshow.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Moshow the Cat Rapper</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The launch of Parking Kitty has been a first step for PBOT into a new era of parking management and technology,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to win this award from WTS and thrilled to have a happy pink kitty icon and a tremendously talented cat rapper leading us towards the future of parking in Portland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A big challenge in getting those of us who drive most of the time to switch to walking, biking, and transit is helping them them create mental maps of those more sustainable modes.&nbsp; That's part of the reason that the Bureau of Transportation publishes <strong><a href=""/transportation/article/70221"">so many maps</a></strong> on how to get around by walking, biking, and transit.&nbsp; We are trying to help people create their own mental maps of their transportation options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started thinking about this after <strong><a href=""http://www.humantransit.org/2010/08/toronto-a-new-frequent-network-plan.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+HumanTransit+%28Human+Transit%29"" target=""_blank"">reading a post</a></strong> by Jarret Walker, who writes the blog Human Transit (he's also a transit planner among other professional pursuits).&nbsp; He's applauds Toronto's new transit map because it brands high frequency service in a clear, easy-to-follow manner (much as TriMet <strong><a href=""http://trimet.org/images/frequentservice/frequentservice.jpg"" target=""_blank"">already does</a></strong> to an extent).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the big point that stuck out to me (and to Walker) was this (emphasis mine):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">""I also like the emphasis on <strong>naming the lines after the streets they run o</strong>n. If your city is fortunate to have long streets with a single streetname, this kind of naming helps people think of the transit line as an intrinsic part of the street itself -- exactly the kind of simplification that we need if people are ever going to rely on their transit networks the way they rely on their street networks -- not just as mobility tools, but <strong>as ways of organizing their idea of their city</strong>.""</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could we do this in Portland?&nbsp; And not just for transit but for bicycling and walking?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think so.&nbsp; We already have trails that are not defined by a number or some other identifier.&nbsp; Most everyone can picture the Springwater Trail or Tom McCall Waterfront path.&nbsp; We all know what we're talking about when we say the Hawthorne Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, I believe our developing Bike Boulevard/Neighborhood Greenway system could really benefit from this type of branding.&nbsp; Informally a lot of people call a street they bicycle on by it's name, for example the recently developed Going Bike Boulevard.&nbsp; But there is not a cohesive identity advertised for the Going Street project or others.&nbsp; I want to change that, but would love a little help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've got some ideas for branding our next generation of bikeways, drop me an email (scott[dot]cohen[at]portlandoregon[dot]gov) or leave a comment.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/314420

In fact, the mini-exodus from driving has exposed significant cracks in the country's mass transit systems, which are struggling to accommodate new riders.

<p>Chris grew up in Beaverton and now lives in New York City. He says Adaptive BIKETOWN is another great reason to visit Portland. Photo courtesy of Chris Pangilinan</p>
<p>(Dec. 19, 2017) A Beaverton native and graduate of Portland State University's Civil Engineering program, Chris Pangilinan has designed bike lanes in San Francisco, as well as bus and rail lines in Chicago, San Francisco, and New York. He holds a Masters in Transportation from MIT and has worked for large transit agencies, the US Department of Transportation, and New York-based transportation foundation TransitCenter. And now, he's added another feather to his transportation cap: cycling in Portland.&nbsp;<br /><img class=""content-left"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2017/12/1707812/1670976/chris_crop.jpg"" alt=""chris on adaptive BIKETOWN"" width=""181"" height=""220"" /></p>
<h2>""This opened up a whole new world for me to explore Portland, spend time with friends, and get exercise.""</h2>
<h3>-Chris Pangilinan, Adaptive BIKETOWN user &amp; Transportation Engineer</h3>
<p>Chris has ridden an adaptive bike before &ndash; in fact, he makes a point of visiting cities with adaptive bike rental programs, including Reno and his local program in New York City. Chris was born with Cerebral Palsy, which he said affects his balance, ability to walk and use a two-wheeled bike.</p>
<p>So when Chris first heard about&nbsp;<a href=""http://adaptivebiketown.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Adaptive BIKETOWN</a>, he said, ""I gotta try it!""</p>
<p>With Adaptive BIKETOWN, operated by Kerr Bikes, Chris got to bike on the famous Springwater Corridor Trail for the first time.</p>
<p>He also experienced what it felt like to cycle next to traffic for the first time.</p>
<p>""As a transportation engineer, I should know how that feels!"" Chris said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>And beyond the practicality and his professional interest, Chris said being able to bike in Portland with his friends &ndash; many of whom he describes as bikers or active &ndash; is an ""immeasurable value.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>""This opened up a whole new world for me to explore Portland, spend time with friends, and get exercise,"" he said.</p>
<p>Chris surprised himself when he and his friend Jeff Mack rode all the way to Milwaukie and back (over 11 miles!).</p>
<p>For Chris, being able to ride is ""hugely important... It&rsquo;s indescribable what the freedom is like to get on a bike if you&rsquo;ve never been on one before.&nbsp; Most people take it for granted, because they grew up on one, but to go from wheelchairing and riding buses to actually riding a bike is just a whole new level. And I&rsquo;m not even going to even try to describe it, because I can&rsquo;t, you have to go do it yourself to understand!""</p>
<p>Chris said he's excited to ride Adaptive BIKETOWN at Kerr Bikes again next year. With Adaptive BIKETOWN here, it's another great reason to visit Portland, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive BIKETOWN's pilot season by the numbers</strong></p>

<p>(Dec. 22, 2017) The National Weather Service has notified the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) of the potential for winter weather and slick road conditions through Monday, December 25. The traveling public should exercise caution on Portland roadways, particularly at high elevations and overnight when temperatures may drop below freezing.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">The traveling public is advised to use caution when traveling through the holiday weekend. Locations at or above 500 feet could experience slick road conditions and wet areas could freeze overnight. PBOT crews will be patrolling Portland streets to monitor conditions and treat roads as needed throughout the holiday weekend.</p>

<h3>WATCH FOR BLACK ICE</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Black ice is defined as ice that remains on roadways that are not subjected to direct sunlight. Black ice commonly forms on roads that wind around lakes and rivers, in tunnels, on overpasses and in highly shaded, rural areas. Black ice is almost invisible to the naked eye. Be especially careful when driving&nbsp;or riding&nbsp;into shaded areas, on bridges and overpasses, and on infrequently traveled roads.&nbsp;Slow down during your approach.</p>
<h3>LOOK OUT FOR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for pedestrians and bicyclists who are also trying to&nbsp;get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions.&nbsp;Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<h3>CARRY AN EMERGENCY WEATHER KIT</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Carry an emergency weather kit in your vehicle to help keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, shovel, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, and mittens), flashlight, bag of sand, and cellular phone or CB Radio.</p>

<h3>WATCH FOR BLACK ICE</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Black ice is defined as ice that remains on roadways that are not subjected to direct sunlight. Black ice commonly forms on roads that wind around lakes and rivers, in tunnels, on overpasses and in highly shaded, rural areas. Black ice is almost invisible to the naked eye. Be especially careful when driving&nbsp;or riding&nbsp;into shaded areas, on bridges and overpasses, and on infrequently traveled roads.&nbsp;Slow down during your approach.</p>
<h3>LOOK OUT FOR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Be watchful for pedestrians and bicyclists who are also trying to&nbsp;get around in hazardous, low visibility conditions.&nbsp;Share the Road safely and responsibly.</p>
<h3>CARRY AN EMERGENCY WEATHER KIT</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">Carry an emergency weather kit in your vehicle to help keep you safe and more comfortable during long waits. Your kit should include chains, battery jumper cables, first aid kit, shovel, basic tools (pliers, wrench, screwdriver and knife), blanket, extra clothing (hats, socks, boots, and mittens), flashlight, bag of sand, and cellular phone or CB Radio.</p>

No shovels are provided, so the public must bring their own. The sandbag sites are located at:</p>

<li>SE&nbsp;88th Avenue just south of&nbsp;Holgate Boulevard in the parking lot at Lents Park. Enter parking&nbsp;lot at the bottom of the hill, and follow one-way traffic to the sand pile at the exit on the east side of SE 88th;</li>

<p class=""gd_p"">In the event of flooding, PBOT is prepared to close travel lanes and/or streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Should streets need to be closed, PBOT asks the traveling public to obey all road closed signs. Do not move them or drive around them.

<p class=""gd_p"">(January 9, 2018) The launch of the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) new program, Safe Ride Home, on New Year&rsquo;s Eve was a resounding success. Over 2500 people took advantage of discounted taxi and transportation network company rides during the holiday. Thousands more chose to ride TriMet and a total of 75 intrepid revelers used BIKETOWN bike share to get to and from their parties.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Impaired driving is a major contributor to death and injury on Portland streets. More than half of deadly crashes in Portland involve people who are intoxicated.

<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;On a night with thousands of Portlanders choosing to imbibe as they ring in the new year, I am thankful that people made the responsible choice of taking a safe ride home,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;The success of this program shows the value of providing affordable travel options to prevent people from driving while impaired.

<p>In addition to a completely rebuilt street, the section of SW Naito from SW Harrison to SW Jefferson foresees:</p>
<ul>
<li>New traffic signals, including a dedicated signal for vehicles accessing the Hawthorne Bridge and a pedestrian crossing signal to access Pettygrove Park, the Lovejoy Fountain, and the Halprin Blocks.</li>
<li>New bicycle and pedestrian facilities on the east side of the street, including a new path and sidewalk. Currently, no bicycle or pedestrian facilities exist on the east side of SW Naito.</li>
<li>Updated signal timing to improve traffic operations through the corridor.</li>
<li>Improved crossings at major intersections to improve safety.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This project will build an important connection for people bicycling, walking, and accessing Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park, Portland State University, and the South Waterfront neighborhood. Currently, no sidewalks or bike facilities exist on the east side of SW Naito.&nbsp;The project&rsquo;s boundaries end just beyond SW Jefferson, providing connection to Waterfront Park year-round and the seasonal Better Naito project from May to September.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Jan. 31, 2018)&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation is proud to announce the eleven projects that have been selected for the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73920?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland in the Streets Community Grant Program</a>. The program was established to support community-driven projects focused on transportation safety, equity, innovation and placemaking. Portlanders were especially encouraged to submit proposals for transportation safety projects in support of Vision Zero, creative community infrastructure projects, events in city streets, urban trail projects and initiatives that support innovative community engagement.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sixty-three applications were submitted by Portland community and neighborhood groups requesting a total of $736,954. A total of $100,000 was available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;As these projects clearly show, our communities are overflowing with creative ideas about how to improve their neighborhoods. We are very excited to be partnering on these projects, and we are already learning so much from the thoughtful and innovative ideas that Portlanders brought forward,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;I am gratified that we are able to help these communities realize their visions for safer and more attractive streets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Eleven grants were awarded to the following projects:</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Bridlemile Walkway $3,368</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This project will transform a walkway in the Bridlemile neighborhood of SW Portland. The walkway is used by neighbors to access area schools, bus stops and grocery stores and is a part of the SW Trails network.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>""Dia de las Ni&ntilde;as y los Ni&ntilde;os"" Parade and Celebration $3,625</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This community event is hosted annually by the Rigler Elementary School PTA to celebrate the Latin American holiday. This year&rsquo;s event will include a Safe Routes to School theme and promote active transportation options for students and families in the Cully neighborhood.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Heritage Tree Trail $1,200</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The University of Portland Neighborhood Association will use this project to promote the use of urban trails and neighborhood greenways, while also increasing awareness of the heritage trees network in their North Portland community.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Lents Green Ring Wayfinding Project $16,000</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Green Lents and NAYA Generations, along with other community partners, will utilize these resources to engage community members on the development of a &ldquo;Green Ring&rdquo; in Southeast Portland. The &ldquo;Green Ring&rdquo; will promote active transportation, incorporate placemaking infrastructure and address safety concerns that have been a barrier to pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Living Cully Community Wayfinding Project $16,000</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This project, led by Verde and Living Cully community partners, will complete a bilingual wayfinding system that will encourage pedestrian and bicycle access to six green spaces in the Cully community, including Thomas Cully Park scheduled to open in 2018.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>NE 85th Street Community Greenspace and Intersection Repair $3,675</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Neighbors in the Beech Milton community (near Madison High School) will utilize these funds to address pedestrian safety concerns and revive two intersection paintings, with a special focus on engaging diverse community members and local schools.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Painted Curb in Sullivan&rsquo;s Gulch $8,550</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This project seeks to address pedestrian safety concerns at the intersection of NE 21st Avenue and NE Clackamas Street. The rapidly growing Sullivan&rsquo;s Gulch community has identified this as a problematic area for pedestrians seeking to access neighborhood grocery stores and transit.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Rosewood Center Parklet $9,785</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Rosewood Initiative will utilize these resources to facilitate the development of community identity markers and wayfinding signage that promotes the use of neighborhood greenways, highlights community spaces, and directs pedestrians to transit stops in Outer East Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Safety Corridor for Deaf Children $16,000</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Tucker Maxon School for the deaf will utilize these resources to address safety concerns near their school at SE Holgate and SE 28th. Their project vision includes speed bumps, maintenance of a gravel road and artistic placemaking.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>ULPDX Williams Ave &amp; Russell St Project $16,000</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Led by the Urban League of Portland, and in partnership with Portland Community Reinvestment Initiative, this project will facilitate community beautification with the implementation of creative placemaking that celebrates the rich history of this intersection and community.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>Urban Trails Maintenance and Construction in Southwest $5,500</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">SW Trails PDX will utilize these funds to improve community connectivity with an urban trail maintenance project of steps on SW Trail #1 from SW Twombly Ave to SW Melville Ave.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Portland in the Streets Community Grant applications were due August 31, 2017. During the application period, eighty-two community members attended three informational workshops that provided more information and made staff available for technical questions. With the support of consults from Design + Culture Lab, there was also an intentional effort to solicit ideas from communities that have historically been underserved by City services and programming.&nbsp;Applications were scored for (1) project feasibility; (2) community partnerships and equity; (3) transportation and safety benefit; and (4) livability and community placemaking.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The selected projects will be supported by teams of PBOT staff across the bureau who will provide technical assistance informed by the priorities of the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71710?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Livable Streets Strategy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/66612?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero</a>, as well as other areas of PBOT work. PBOT will seek City Council authorization to continue the Portland in the Streets Community Grant Program in future years. The timeline for year two of the program has not yet been determined.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Feb. 2, 2018) As I spent a week learning about transportation planning, I wasn't sure how many people would be interested in learning about a new bike lane downtown. I come from Los Angeles, a city well-known for its numerous highways and traffic, but not its bike-friendly roads. A career shadow program organized by Reed College and the Portland Bureau of Transportation showed me just how passionate Portlanders are about having clean, green transportation options.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On the evening of Jan. 10, Portland residents gathered at PSU&rsquo;s Center for Executive and Professional Education, to see PBOT&rsquo;s first unveiling of&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/75403?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">the plan to renovate SW Naito Parkway</a>. The event was held at night, deep inside a large building. Despite the voluntary nature of the event, a surprisingly large amount of people came! More than 130 signed in, in writing, at the entrance. Recent college graduates, retirees, people who live downtown, and Southeast and Northwest Portland &ndash; all crowded into&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/669963?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">the Open House</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""float: left; margin: 7px;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/01/1754922/1721826/ryankim_crop.jpg"" alt=""Ryan Kim, Reed College student 2018"" hspace=""7"" width=""201"" height=""275"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>SW Naito Parkway is a scenic corridor needing improvement. Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park and the Willamette River provide a spectacular view. However, currently, there are problems of safety, traffic congestion, and cracking pavement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During peak hours, vehicle traffic builds up all the way from Hawthorne Bridge Ramp to sometimes as far as Harrison Street. However, traffic is not the only concern. People utilizing other modes of transportation are also placed in dangerous situations. For example, the lack of bicycle facilities requires people riding to weave through pedestrians in Waterfront Park and to navigate a steep, narrow sidewalk to access the Hawthorne Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The official plan consists of creating new, safer facilities for both bikes and pedestrians. It would build a 12-foot two-way bikeway and a 8-foot wide sidewalk, both separated from car traffic by a curb lined with trees. It also attempts to improve traffic efficiency through the use of new traffic signals. A new traffic signal on the bridge ramp would ease traffic through, removing a blockade that often stops rush-hour traffic on SW Naito. This would cut time spent stuck in traffic. The project is planned to begin construction at the end of 2018, and will take about nine months to complete.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The Open House event revealed these plans to the public to increase awareness, to gain an idea of public opinion, and to receive input on possible improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Once I walked through the door, it felt as though I was in a modern art museum. To my left was a video simulation of cars, represented as small dots, flowing on SW Naito and onto the bridge.&nbsp; To my right was a 3D video of a virtual flyover, in the futuristic perspective what looked like a low-flying drone. Further back and to my left, were posters with white borders and an artistic quality in each. In the middle was an expanded, 20-foot long aerial photo of the street with the planned improvements marked all over it. People were encouraged to write down their specific concerns and praises on sticky notes, placing them in the right spot on the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The general view of the public seemed to be positive. As expected, people who ride bicycles were extremely enthusiastic, leaving multiple suggestions and staying longer at the Open House to talk to fellow bikers and to learn more of the project.&nbsp; However, it appeared that pedestrians and drivers were also generally supportive of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">One concern of a driver was losing a lane under the bridge in an already crowded route, but, they also felt that the improvements in efficiency would eliminate this problem. Pedestrians were also supportive of the project, but they were still somewhat unclear as to exactly how much safety would be improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The plan is still in its 60 percent stage, but the big, yet diverse turnout to the Open House reaffirms the communal spirit of Portland. Furthermore, the general, positive view of inclusive transportation accommodations reaffirms Portland's support for cleaner forms of transportation. Hopefully, the project will be completed as soon as possible, and improve traffic and allow thousands of people to bike and walk along a new, safer route.</p>

<p>(Feb. 6, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation began to implement a new 20 mph speed limit change on Tuesday, as&nbsp;crews posted the first of about 2,000 signs that will cover nearly 70 percent of city streets.</p>
<p>The speed reduction will make streets safer, and help the City achieve Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries. In 2017, 45 people were killed in traffic crashes in Portland, nearly double the number of people killed in homicides.</p>
<p>""It is unacceptable for anyone to be killed by traffic violence,"" PBOT Director Leah Treat said. ""Today we are poised to take a significant step forward in making our neighborhoods safer and more livable. Five miles an hour may not sound like much, but when it comes to reducing the severity of crashes it makes a big difference. By reducing speeds from 25 to 20, we can make it nearly two times more likely that a person will survive a crash.""</p>
<p>The change was approved by the Portland City Council Jan. 17, after the state legislature gave the City the authority to reduce speed limits by 5 mph on residential streets.</p>
<p>To call attention to the change, Treat and Portland Police Bureau Captain Michael Crebs spoke at a news conference on Tuesday and helped a PBOT sign crew install the first 20 mph sign to replace a 25 mph sign. The sign is located on SE 168th Avenue, just south of SE Stark St.</p>
<p>The new residential speed limit takes effect citywide April 1. As signs are installed in coming weeks, people driving should follow the speed limit as it is posted on each street. The new 20 mph signs will be installed first in East Portland and then in North Portland, which have the highest rates of traffic fatalities. The residential speed limit change is just one aspect of the City's Vision Zero program, which focuses safety improvements, education and enforcement efforts on busy streets where most traffic fatalities occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71730?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero Action Plan</a>&nbsp;identifies 30 streets on the High Crash Network, where safety improvements are prioritized. Roads on the list represent only 8 percent of city streets, but account for 57 percent of deadly crashes.</p>
<p>This year, PBOT will make safety improvements on 17 streets on the High Crash Network, including Outer Glisan, NE Halsey and outer SE Division St. PBOT's Vision Zero web site has&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/658308?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">a map of the 17 streets</a>&nbsp;where improvements are planned to start construction this year.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, PBOT will install speed safety cameras on NE Marine Drive. In&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70763?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">three other corridors</a>&nbsp;where cameras were installed, top-end speeding was cut by more than half.</p>

<li><strong>Do Not Pass Snowplows:&nbsp;</strong>On Tuesday and Wednesday, snowplow operators reported multiple near-misses. Private vehicles passed snowplows on the left, nearly causing crashes with oncoming traffic, or passing on the right, driving into airborne snow and other debris displaced by the plow.</li>
<li><strong>Private Sector Help:</strong>&nbsp;For the first time, PBOT hired private contractors to help clear snow. Titan Utilities and Moore Excavation used front-end loaders on Wednesday morning to plow school bus routes at 13 schools in the Portland Public and David Douglas School districts. PBOT is hiring them again to plow before dawn Thursday morning, along with a third contractor, Westech Construction, which should cover a total of about 20 schools among the three firms. PBOT crews also plowed some residential streets on school bus routes. The goal is to provide passable streets on school bus routes, which include some streets that are too narrow for city trucks to access.</li>

<li>Weigh in on evaluation criteria</li>
<li>Provide input on priorities for design and construction</li>
<li>Connect the project with key stakeholders and community representatives, and identify opportunities for public engagement</li>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Feb. 23, 2018)&nbsp;Portland Bureau of Transportation&nbsp;crews applied about 30 tons of road salt and 10,000 gallons of de-icer on Thursday night and Friday morning, in advance of the forecast for Friday evening snow. Crews also sprayed about 300 gallons of liquid magnesium chloride de-icer during the day on Friday.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""https://business.facebook.com/NWSPortland/?business_id=151439405252349&amp;fref=mentions&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">US National Weather Service Portland Oregon</a>&nbsp;has forecast a trace to 1 inch of snow for Portland from 7 to 10pm tonight, with snow expected to accumulate only on streets above 500 feet. Snow in most of the city is expected to only stick to grassy areas, not streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The bureau will have extra crews on city streets above 500 feet in NW and SW Portland as well as Mt Scott in East Portland. Crews will re-apply de-icer and road salt. Crews will also have snow plows patrolling areas above 500 feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This week, PBOT has been using a road salt product called Ice Kicker. Unlike table salt, Ice Kicker has anti-corrosive properties that reduce the risk of causing rust on vehicles and infrastructure. The manufacturer adds blue dye, which makes it visible to the public and city crews. PBOT uses only about 200 pounds per lane mile, a low rate of application that further reduces the chances of harm to vegetation and property.&nbsp;PBOT spread about 140 tons of road salt earlier this week. The salt appears to have helped keep many key routes open, including Germantown Road, a notorious trouble spot that has been safe for travel all week.</p>

The bureau also released its&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/675039?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">2017 Better Naito Report</a>, which documents the first iteration of the project by the city,&nbsp;offering in-depth&nbsp;data analyses of travel times, traffic volumes, mode-splits and more.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The project was incredibly popular with people walking and biking. In just one day, over 12,000 people walking used Better Naito to access the Waterfront Blues Fest. What's more, a total of 393,173 one-way trips were taken by people on bikes on Better Naito over the five-month project&nbsp;period.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Better Naito, which reconfigures Naito Parkway from the Hawthorne Bridge to the Steel Bridge for five months, provides a protected space for people to get to and around Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park during Portland&rsquo;s busy and popular festival season.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Consistent with the data collected during Better Naito&rsquo;s two pilot seasons in 2015 and 2016, the 2017 season had minimal impact on motor vehicle travel times in the corridor. Current observations and analysis found that during&nbsp;peak morning commute hours (7:00-8:00 a.m.), driving times for northbound traffic from SW Clay St to SW Stark St increased by 1 minute 28 seconds. Similarly, the&nbsp;traffic impact for&nbsp;afternoon&nbsp;peak commuters (4:00-5:00 p.m.) was an additional 1 minute and 33 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The locally-developed smartphone ride tracking app Ride Report&nbsp;confirms the popularity of Better Naito, showing that people bicycling were twice as likely to ride Better Naito than the Waterfront Trail. Likewise&nbsp;people biking were 3.5 times as likely to ride on Naito Parkway during the Better Naito season than during the off-season.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(March 7, 2018) &ldquo;PBOT prioritizes people by encouraging the use of the right-of-way for community gathering spaces, placemaking and programming.&rdquo; This policy statement is the essence of PBOT&rsquo;s Livable Streets Strategy, which was adopted by Portland City Council in October 2017. Since the Livable Streets Strategy&rsquo;s adoption, the bureau has been working to develop the programs that will put this policy into practice. We call the program&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.portlandinthestreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland in the Streets</a>.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">What programs are part of Portland in the Streets? Here&rsquo;s a quick list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/transportation/66080?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Block Parties</a>&nbsp;- Small scale parties held on residential streets, such as neighborhood potlucks and barbecues that are held by, and for, residents along the street.</li>
<li><a href=""/transportation/66885?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Community Events</a>&nbsp;- Larger scale events that occur in the public right of way intended to build a sense of community. These events bring people from the entire neighborhood or region and events support and encourage community gatherings and local businesses.</li>
<li>Street Paintings - Large format works of art, designed and painted on local streets that build community, empower neighbors to shape their own public realm, create an artistic expression that&rsquo;s about the people who live nearby, and break down social isolation.</li>
<li>Pedestrian Plazas - Long term community placemaking projects within the right-of-way to create open space on underutilized streets, alleys, or other roadways for the public to use and activate.</li>
<li>Street Prototyping - Community Initiated projects that test a new street or intersection design concept, and collect data to inform future design decisions.</li>
<li>Spaces to Places &ndash; These projects turn gravel, dirt and underdeveloped low volume streets or alleyways into places where people want to gather and install amenities desirable to the community.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">The sun is out and the weather is warming up. Soon, thousands of people will be using Portland&rsquo;s streets for all these great programs. So it&rsquo;s great timing that today, City Council approved changes to City code and Administrative rules that will allow us to ensure the City has consistent rules and processes in place to effectively design, implement, manage, and maintain placemaking and community use activities in the public right of way. These changes will help PBOT create a citywide program that helps community groups create and activate their own spaces that are unique to their own neighborhoods.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Among the changes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>City Code Chapter 17.24 &ndash; Permits -&nbsp;Creates a new Portland in the Streets administrative rule to establish a consistent framework for all programs</li>
<li>City Code Chapter 17.25 &ndash; Sidewalk Cafes - Creates new permit and fee type for Sidewalk Caf&eacute;s to extend their operations during a Community Event street closure</li>
<li>TRN 3.450 &ndash; Block Party permit fees going from $10 to zero - Eliminates the fees for the Block Party Program</li>
<li>TRN 3.450 &ndash;&nbsp;Park(ing) Day permit fee going from $25 to zero - Eliminates the fees for the Park(ing) Day Program</li>
</ul>

<p>Impaired driving is a major contributor to death and injury on Portland&nbsp;streets.&nbsp;More than half of deadly crashes in Portland involve people who are&nbsp;intoxicated. Safe Ride Home helps to achieve the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action Plan&rsquo;s goal of launching initiatives to reduce impaired driving.&nbsp;According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), during the 2016 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day holiday period, almost two-fifths (39%) of all motor vehicle crash fatalities in the United States involved drunk driving. This is the second Safe Ride Home holiday offer from PBOT, the first was on New Year's Eve, Dec. 31, 2017.</p>
<p>""After such a successful Safe Ride Home program on New Year's, with over 2,500 people choosing a safe ride, I'm thrilled that we are bringing back our safe ride offerings for Portlanders on St. Patrick's Day,"" said Transportation Director Leah Treat.&nbsp;""Over 50 percent of deadly crashes in Portland involve people who are impaired.&nbsp;As we continue our Vision Zero efforts, we are working to make our roads safer for all users. Thanks to our private for-hire ride fee, we will continue to fund this important initiative.""</p>
<p>The Safe Ride Home program is a partnership between PBOT, the Portland Police Bureau, TriMet, Old Town Hospitality Group, and Portland cab companies Radio Cab, Broadway Cab, New Rose City Cab, New Green Cab, PDX Yellow Cab and United Independent Cab, as well as transportation network companies Lyft and Uber. The program is funded by a 50-cent fee charged for every taxi and TNC ride in Portland. The fee also covers safety inspections and helps defray the cost of rides for people with disabilities.</p>

News,677527,News Release: Speed Safety Cameras on NE Marine Drive to start issuing tickets on Thursday,1,,2018-03-21 23:48:53 UTC,2018-03-21 23:46:00 UTC,A,Top-end speeding already reduced by 95 percent,"<p class=""gd_p"">(March 21, 2018) --&nbsp;The Speed Safety Cameras on NE Marine Drive will start issuing speeding tickets on Thursday, March 22, after 30 days of issuing warnings.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2016/08/986097/1835110/visionzerologo_crop.png"" alt=""Vision Zero Portland logo"" hspace=""7"" width=""192"" height=""192"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The goal of the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70763?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Speed Safety Camera program</a>&nbsp;is to reduce speeding and save lives. Marine Drive is one of 30 streets that comprise Portland's&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/54892?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">High Crash Network</a>. The roads in this network make up just 8 percent of Portland streets, but account for 57 percent of fatal crashes citywide.</p>
<p>The Speed Safety Cameras started issuing warnings on Feb. 20, and the 30-day warning period ends today, March 21, 2018. Those drivers who exceeded the speed limit and were photographed by the cameras during this period received warning letters alerting them to their violation of the speed limit.&nbsp;The cameras are located in two locations on the corridor &ndash; westbound near NE 138th Avenue and eastbound near NE 33rd Avenue. The cameras on NE Marine Drive are the final cameras to be installed as part of the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) initial pilot project.</p>
<p>Data collected during the warning period shows that&nbsp;the number of drivers speeding on NE Marine Drive has decreased substantially.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Before the cameras were installed, an average of 11,113 vehicles per day traveled over the speed limit on NE Marine Drive.</li>
<li>After the cameras were installed, an average of 3,366 vehicles drove over the speed limit on NE Marine Drive reflecting a&nbsp;70 percent decrease&nbsp;from the initial speed studies.</li>
<li>The reductions in top-end speeding were even more impressive. Top-end speeding is defined as driving 10 miles an hour or more above the posted speed limit. The speed safety cameras reduced this type of dangerous behavior by 95 percent. An average of 1,480 vehicles per day exceeded the speed limit by 10 mph or more before the camera installation. After the cameras were installed, only 80 vehicles per day did.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Our Speed Safety Cameras&nbsp;have&nbsp;had&nbsp;an undeniable impact on reducing speeding. Over the past two years we&rsquo;ve seen&nbsp;significant and continuous reductions on the four High Crash Corridors where the cameras are installed,&rdquo; said Transportation Leah Treat. &ldquo;As we work to&nbsp;make our roads safer for all users, Speed Safety Cameras will continue to be an important tool&nbsp;in our Vision Zero toolbox.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The speed safety cameras on NE Marine Drive are the result of the 2015 passage of HB 2621, which allows them to be used on High Crash Corridors in the Portland city limits. The City of Portland has been using other cameras to supplement speed enforcement for years, with police officers in vans enforcing speed limit violations. Portland also uses cameras to increase enforcement compliance with red lights at traffic signals.</p>
<p>The NE Marine Drive cameras installation and activation marks the conclusion of the bureau&rsquo;s initial&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70763?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">speed safety camera pilot program</a>&nbsp;which installed cameras on four High Crash Corridors &ndash; SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway, SE Division Street, SE 122nd Avenue and NE Marine Drive. The first cameras in Portland were installed on SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway in the fall of 2016. The bureau will conduct speed studies as well as publish a public survey in the coming months as part of the program&rsquo;s evaluation. The information gathered will guide future Speed Safety Camera implementation locations.</p>
<h2>How They Work</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">When people exceed the posted speed limit while driving past the safety cameras, the camera systems capture photos and video for review by Portland Police. An officer from the Portland Police Bureau will review violations before a citation is issued. Penalties are the same as a speeding violation initiated by any other means. The typical speeding citation in Oregon is a Class C violation (11 to 20 mph in excess of the speed limit) resulting in a $170 fine. HB 2621 requires that money received from the speeding tickets can only be spent to cover the cost of the program or pay for safety improvements and programs on High Crash Corridors.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Speed Safety Cameras program provides ample warning to people driving in the area. State law requires speed signage and speed reader boards to be installed on the street warning drivers at least 100 yards in advance of the cameras in both directions. Speed&nbsp;reader board displays a driver&rsquo;s current rate of speed providing immediate feedback in advance of the fixed speed safety camera.&nbsp;PBOT staff also conducted extensive outreach with community stakeholders to raise awareness of the changes along the two corridors, before the cameras were installed.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to the new cameras, PBOT is delivering&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/59283?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">additional safety and maintenance projects on Marine Drive</a>. For example, PBOT will install a traffic signal at NE Marine Drive and 122nd Avenue, and installation of rumble strips is planned as well.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland has joined cities around the country in embracing Vision Zero &ndash; the notion that the death of even one person on our roads is one too many. Vision Zero prevents traffic deaths through smart policy and system design.

<p class=""gd_p"">(March 21, 2018)&nbsp;How do you walk in Portland? That was the question that graduate students in the University of Oregon&rsquo;s Multimedia Journalism Master&rsquo;s program asked eight Portlanders. The answers, made into a series of eight short videos, are surprisingly diverse and profoundly poignant. The video series was introduced last night at the public screening:&nbsp;&nbsp;PedPDX: Pedestrian Stories at the University of Oregon&rsquo;s School of Journalism and Communication&rsquo;s (UOSOJC) Portland campus in the White Stag Building. The videos can be viewed online at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pedpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.pedpdx.com</a>.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The co-hosted event with the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication and the Portland Bureau of Transportation, marked the beginning of the public conversation and dialogue about the many ways that Portlanders navigate their city as pedestrians.&nbsp;PBOT invites Portlanders to share their own walking stories&nbsp;in photos, videos, and text on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter by tagging&nbsp;the bureau&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>@PBOTInfo</strong>&nbsp;and using&nbsp;<strong>#PedPDX.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<li>What are your hopes for Portland as a great walking city for everyone?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><strong>We want to hear from you!</strong></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">These stories will be an important source of input into&nbsp;PedPDX, Portland's Citywide Pedestrian Plan.&nbsp;The plan will&nbsp;prioritize sidewalks, crossing improvements, and other investments to make walking safer and more comfortable across the city. In service of this work, PBOT aims to elevate public understanding of the range and diversity of needs that Portlanders have when it comes to walking.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">We look forward to continuing this important conversation.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program,&nbsp;paid for by a local gas tax approved by Portland voters in May 2016 and a heavy vehicle use tax, is Portland&rsquo;s first street repair and traffic safety program financed with local funding. 56 percent of Fixing Our Streets funding is invested in street maintenance and 44 percent is invested in safety improvements. The City Council ordinance included a project list that shows specific projects that are intended to be funded.

<p>About the Fixing Our Streets Program</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;program is the result of the passage of Measure 26-173, a 10-cent tax on motor vehicle fuels and Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to street repair and traffic safety projects. Passed on May 17, 2016, Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years.&nbsp;PBOT will invest this money in a wide variety of street improvement and safety projects across the entire city. Fixing Our Streets will help PBOT expand preventive street maintenance that saves money and prevents potholes. It will support our work to make it safer for children to walk to school. It will allow us to build more sidewalks, traffic signals, street lights and bike lanes.&nbsp;The Portland City Council also unanimously passed a Heavy Vehicle Use Tax, for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds, which will also fund the Fixing Our Streets program.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/678122

<p>(April 2, 2018) As part of the City of Portland's&nbsp;<a href=""https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/bulletins/www.visionzeroportland.com"">Vision Zero</a>&nbsp;effort to end traffic fatalities and serious injuries, the Portland Bureau of Transportation today unveiled 'Struck,' a safety education campaign designed to get Portlanders to slow down.&nbsp;It is the largest public education campaign ever undertaken by the Transportation Bureau, and the first major campaign launched as part of the Vision Zero effort.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the campaign, called Struck, is a forceful, attention-grabbing video that conveys a unique message about the serious impact traffic crashes have. The campaign speaks to the impact on the victim, who just lost his or her life, and to the vehicle driver, who just destroyed the life they knew.</p>
<p>""If we are going to reduce fatalities, we need to change how people think when they get behind the wheel,"" said City Commissioner Dan Saltzman, who oversees PBOT. ""It used to be socially acceptable to drive without a seat belt or drive when people were not quite sober. But with new laws and education campaigns, we changed people's behavior. We need to do the same thing with speeding.""</p>
<p>PBOT Director Leah Treat said the campaign is built on national best practices. Research shows that education campaigns such as this one are an effective tool to change behavior, Treat said. Studies also show that cities can make even more progress by combining education with the other two Es of transportation safety: Engineering our roads to be safer and smart Enforcement to make sure people drive safer.</p>
<p>Treat noted that Portland's Vision Zero strategy is built around addressing all three Es.</p>
<p>""The Struck campaign will make our streets safer by educating the public about the need to slow down when driving,"" Treat said. ""With this campaign, we are changing the culture of speeding in Portland. We're letting everyone know that if you cause a fatal crash, you will not only take another person's life, but your own life will be forever changed. Public education efforts like this are crucial for us to reach our Vision Zero goal of ending traffic fatalities and serious injuries.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>The campaign will launch with a TV spot during the NCAA Championship game tonight, and on strategically placed billboards, buses, movie theaters and social media channels.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland ad agency&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bpninc.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Borders Perrin Norrander</a>&nbsp;was hired by PBOT to develop an awareness campaign that highlights the need for safer driving.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The video recreates a car crash without any cars to put full focus on the toll deadly crashes have people.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">While developing the campaign, BPN worked with PBOT staff, the Vision Zero Task Force and Families for Safe Streets to find a message that would resonate with drivers. A key insight came from Capt. Michael Crebs, who leads the Traffic Division for the Portland Police Bureau.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;The breakthrough came from a community meeting where Capt. Crebs explained how drivers&rsquo; lives are also deeply impacted by a deadly crash,&rdquo; said Rob Thompson, BPN&rsquo;s Executive Creative Director. &ldquo;From that insight, we developed the idea that by preventing a deadly crash, a driver would actually save two lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71730?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero Action Plan</a>, adopted by the Portland City Council, calls for the City to take dozens of specific actions to end traffic fatalities. The action items include specific steps to address dangerous street designs and dangerous behaviors. The Struck campaign calls for the city to conduct multi-component education campaigns to build public awareness and leverage other Vision Zero actions.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT is investing $300,000 in the Struck campaign, including production and advertising costs, paid from cannabis tax revenue designated for Vision Zero programs. The campaign will expand on the city's Vision Zero efforts, which include more than $40 million in safety improvements to streets in 2018, as well as new lower speed limits on residential streets.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71730?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero Action Plan</a>&nbsp;identifies 30 streets on the High Crash Network, where safety improvements are prioritized. Roads on the list represent only 8 percent of city streets, but account for 57 percent of deadly crashes.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This year, PBOT will make safety improvements on 17 streets on the High Crash Network, including Outer Glisan, NE Halsey and outer SE Division St. PBOT's Vision Zero web site has&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/658308?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">a map of the 17 streets</a>&nbsp;where improvements are planned to start construction this year.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT has also installed speed safety cameras on NE Marine Drive and three other corridors across Portland. The safety cameras have reduced speeding by more than 50 percent, and they have reduced top-end speeding in some cases by more than 90 percent.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(April 17, 2018)&nbsp;The Portland Bureau of Transportation announced a partnership with a local technology company,&nbsp;<a href=""https://ride.report/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Ride&nbsp;Report</a>. The Portland startup's innovative app will collect feedback from thousands of Portland bicyclists and app users to help PBOT make better bicycle planning decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Ride Report, co-founded by Portlanders William Henderson and Evan&nbsp;Heidtmann, is a mobile app that uses machine learning and low-power sensors to automatically track users&rsquo; bike rides. The app helps users track&nbsp;their exercise&nbsp;goals and stats, and encourages them with fun virtual challenges and trophies. At the end of&nbsp;each&nbsp;ride, Ride Report allows users to rate their experience&nbsp;by&nbsp;how comfortable they felt on the trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland cyclists have logged more trips on the Ride Report app than riders in any other US city.&nbsp;Since the app&rsquo;s launch in 2016, Portland riders have logged over 400,000 bike trips covering more than 1.2 million miles -- enough to go around the earth nearly 50 times.&nbsp;Portland was&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the&nbsp;first cities&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;this anonymized data&nbsp;in the planning and&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;of transportation&nbsp;projects,&nbsp;such as the seasonal&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.betternaito.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Better Naito&nbsp;project</a>.&nbsp;The app&nbsp;measures&nbsp;bicycle traffic and gathers public input about the experience of riding a bicycle on hundreds of city streets, across all of Portland.&nbsp;Ride Report now works with&nbsp;more than&nbsp;a dozen city governments around the&nbsp;world.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ride Report data&nbsp;is the latest addition to PBOT's robust data collection efforts, including an annual bike count conducted by&nbsp;trained volunteers&nbsp;to&nbsp;count bike travelers&nbsp;at over 280 locations across the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This partnership is a win-win. Ride Report is a great tool to help people track their rides and it gives us great information about where people like to ride,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Leah Treat. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to use this tool to help inform bureau decisions to make Portland an even greater biking city.&nbsp;I hope more people choose to use this locally-made app&nbsp;to track&nbsp;their bike rides&nbsp;so we can benefit from predictive analytics in shaping future routes.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland made me fall in love with biking. I&rsquo;ve always felt grateful to city, to the people who helped me when I was getting started biking here. I learned the best routes, I learned how to engage with the City and work with them when a route could be better, and I learned how much fun getting around by bike could be!&rdquo; said Ride Report co-founder William Henderson,&nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an engineer, and so of course I&rsquo;ve always wondered: could I use technology to help more people have that experience? Ride Report was created to enhance opportunities for people of all levels of experience and backgrounds to enjoy biking and be part of a larger biking community just by downloading an app. By providing tools and data to cities, people&rsquo;s participation is further enhanced through safer and more comfortable biking infrastructure.&rdquo;&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Northwest&nbsp;Portland and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Central Eastside Parking Districts, PBOT is&nbsp;already&nbsp;partnering with local coffee shops to provide incentives for those who download the app and bike.&nbsp;People&nbsp;will get a buy one, get one free coupon after&nbsp;logging&nbsp;their first ride&nbsp;in the&nbsp;app&nbsp;(to be used at&nbsp;Water Avenue Coffee in the Central Eastside or Jim &amp; Patty's Coffee in Northwest Portland) and a five dollar voucher after five logged trips.&nbsp;People participating in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lovetoride.net/oregon?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Bike More&nbsp;Challenge</a>&nbsp;in May can log their rides automatically by connecting the app to their rider profile.

<p class=""gd_p content-center"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">(April 20, 2018) Today BIKETOWN, the City of Portland&rsquo;s public bike sharing system, released data on its 520,000 user trips since its opening in July 2016.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Since the launch of BIKETOWN on July 19, 2016 through March 31, 2018, users have taken 519,494 trips totaling 1,058,081 miles. PBOT will update the System Data page quarterly and the bureau plans to release additional data showing trip patterns in the coming months. The BIKETOWN System Data page (<a href=""http://www.biketownpdx.com/system-data?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWNpdx.com/system-data</a>) includes a BIKETOWN Dashboard. The dashboard allows the public to explore the data and use it on their own. This includes interactive features that allow the public to graphically display BIKETOWN&rsquo;s trip data by specific search criteria,&nbsp;such as month, station location, frequency of trips per station, trip length, trip distance, and member type.

<p class=""gdp"">Every year the popular festivals in&nbsp;Waterfront Park draw hundreds of thousands of people. During the peak season between April and November, an additional 15,000 more people per day visit the waterfront. Better Naito gives these visitors a protected space to get to and around Waterfront Park by creating a multiuse path along Naito Parkway from the Hawthorne Bridge to the Steel Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">""These&nbsp;festivals are not just wonderful community traditions, they bring&nbsp;people downtown from all over the state and boost our local economy,"" said Art Pearce, Group Manager of Policy, Planning and Projects for PBOT. ""The waterfront is the heart and soul of Portland. Whether walking to a festival, taking a bike ride on the esplanade, or going on a lunch-hour run, we&nbsp;want&nbsp;to make sure Portlanders and visitors can&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;the&nbsp;waterfront&nbsp;in safety and comfort.""</p>
<p class=""gdp"">""We got a good look at it last year and we feel it really works well,"" said Jeff Curtis, Rose Festival Chief Executive Officer. ""It's been a safe and valuable addition to the waterfront in the busy summer months.""</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Traffic counts conducted during last year's Better Naito show the project was incredibly popular with&nbsp;people traveling to and along the waterfront by bike and by foot. In just one day,&nbsp;more than&nbsp;12,000 pedestrians used Better Naito to access the Waterfront Blues Fest. What's more,&nbsp;393,173 one-way trips were taken by&nbsp;people bicycling&nbsp;on Better Naito over the five-month&nbsp;period.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The 2017 season had minimal impact on motor vehicle travel times in the corridor.&nbsp;Observations and analysis found that during peak morning commute hours (7:00 AM), driving times for northbound traffic from SW Clay St to SW Stark St increased by 1 minute 28 seconds. Similarly, the traffic impact for afternoon peak commuters was an additional 1 minute and 33 seconds. These results were consistent with analyses of traffic times in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The first Better Naito in 2015 was a&nbsp;two-week pilot project developed by Better Block PDX, Portland State University, and a host of community partners. Prior to Better Naito, people were often forced to walk in the bike lane, squeeze onto narrow dirt paths, or bike in a travel lane with motor vehicles to reach waterfront events.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">After the successful 2015 and 2016 Better Naito projects run by volunteers, City Council unanimously voted in November 2016 to make Better Naito an official City program and directed PBOT&nbsp;to implement it. The Portland City Council also provided funding to sustain the project for five summers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(May 2, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and Multnomah County Library, with support from Metro, are celebrating Bike Month with &ldquo;Bike to Books,&rdquo; a program to encourage residents to ride their bicycle to their local library.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As part of the program, PBOT and Multnomah County Library are bringing back&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73492?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bike to Books&rdquo; Bike Month coloring contest</a>. Students living in Multnomah County from Pre-Kindergarten to 12th Grade are invited to design bike lane art for installation in one of the City&rsquo;s bike lanes. Portland&rsquo;s bike lane art, found in bike lanes and on neighborhood greenways across the city, is well known nationwide. Designs are created by crew members on their own time using leftover materials that would otherwise go to waste. In 2017, in the first year of our Bike to Books program, PBOT crews installed&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73949?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">four winning Bike to Books bike lane art designs</a>&nbsp;near each winning artist's neighborhood library branch.</p>

<p>It's easy to enter, with a variety of great prizes. Young people in Portland and Multnomah County can submit their own designs using the bike symbol coloring page. The winning art will be installed on a bike lane this summer by one of PBOT's striping crews. Second prize winners will each receive four full-day passes to ride your bicycle at the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.lumberyardmtb.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Lumberyard Bike Park</a>&nbsp;(including rental bikes and safety equipment if needed) and third prize winners will win a bike helmet from Portland-based&nbsp;<a href=""https://nutcasehelmets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Nutcase Helmets</a>. Coloring pages can be picked up at all Multnomah County Library branches (<a href=""https://multcolib.org/hours-and-locations?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">click here for locations</a>) or&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/73492?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">downloaded online</a>. Contestants must drop-off their entry at a library branch in person, to be entered into the contest.&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/636728?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Full contest rules are available online.</a></p>
<p>In addition to the coloring contest, every person who bikes to a Multnomah County Library branch will receive a free bike light provided by Metro (while supplies last). Special&nbsp;<a href=""https://multcolib.org/events/bike-storytime?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Bike Storytimes</a>&nbsp;for young readers are also being offered at numerous library branches across the county.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We want every Portlander to feel they have a voice in the way we design our city and the earlier we can get our residents involved the better,&rdquo; PBOT Director Leah Treat said. &ldquo;This student-designed bike lane art is, in many ways, the beginning of the conversation between PBOT and the young people of Portland who will use our roads, bikeways and sidewalks for decades to come. If they can design such creative art for our streets, imagine the other ideas they&rsquo;ll bring to us in the future. We&rsquo;re excited and we&rsquo;re listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Libraries are about creating connections for people of all ages to learn and create,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Library Director Vailey Oehlke. &ldquo;With Bike to Books, we&rsquo;re teaming up with important partners in PBOT and Metro to share the joy around reading, learning and biking with an eye toward safety and sustainability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Books and bikes are two pillars of Portland culture. One of the busiest public libraries in the United States, Multnomah County Library is beloved by the community it serves. In addition, Portland&rsquo;s young readers bike to school in record numbers. Today, thanks to PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School Program, 36.8 percent of trips to school in Portland are on foot or by bike &ndash; among the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Portland Bike Month runs throughout the month of May with events happening across the city sponsored by multiple organizations to encourage people of all ages to get on their bike and enjoy the spring sunshine and hundreds of miles of bike lanes and neighborhood greenways in the city of Portland.</p>

<p>(May 4, 2018) Have you heard?&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.pbotblockparty.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Block parties</a>&nbsp;are now free throughout Portland! That's right, you can get a permit for a neighborhood block party for zero dollars! Not only that, but the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is&nbsp;pleased to announce that we have doubled the size of our&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/76864?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Pink Barricade Lending Zone</a>&nbsp;for 2018. This means more Portland neighborhoods will be celebrating in their streets this spring, summer and fall with easy access to our pink block party barricades.</p>
<p>The original pilot project was launched in neighborhoods in East Portland with great success in 2017. Portland residents in these neighborhoods told PBOT that the free Block Party permit and free barricade checkouts made hosting a block party a breeze. Many said that they plan to make block parties a new tradition, having connected with their neighbors in new, meaningful ways.</p>
<p>To keep this momentum going,&nbsp;PBOT has expanded the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/76864?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Pink Barricade Lending Zone</a>&nbsp;by adding 26 neighborhoods in Southwest, North, and East Portland&nbsp;(see map above).&nbsp; This addition almost doubles the number of neighborhoods who can check out our bright and fun pink street barricades for free.</p>
<h2>Thank you, community partners!</h2>

<p class=""gd_p"">(May 8, 2018)&nbsp;While Portland Bureau of Transportation&nbsp;crews jump into the 2018 construction season, the planning and design of future projects continues as the bureau looks toward 2019. One such project is the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/649678?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">East Portland Access to Employment &amp; Education (EPAEE)</a>&nbsp;project. EPAEE&nbsp;is a&nbsp;comprehensive,&nbsp;Metro-funded project&nbsp;dedicated to improving&nbsp;East Portlanders'&nbsp;access to&nbsp;public&nbsp;transit, parks, schools, and community centers.&nbsp;The project is currently in the early design phase and is scheduled to&nbsp;begin construction in the summer of 2019.&nbsp;PBOT applied for funding for this project based on needs articulated by East Portland Action Plan members and engaged community residents through East Portland in Motion.&nbsp;The project is funded by $5.5 million&nbsp;Metro&nbsp;grant and $1 million&nbsp;in system development charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">What do we mean when we&nbsp;say&nbsp;&ldquo;Access to Employment &amp; Education&rdquo;? Our goal is to&nbsp;enhance access to major employment hubs and business districts including the Gateway Regional Center, Mall 205, Halsey-Weidler Business District, Division-Midway District and the Rosewood Initiative District.&nbsp;The project will also improve&nbsp;walking and biking&nbsp;access to eight public schools including David Douglas High School, Floyd Light Middle School, Sacramento Elementary&nbsp;and&nbsp;Glenfair&nbsp;Elementary School.&nbsp;Public transit access improvements will help residents connect to more distant employment and education centers including downtown Portland, Clackamas County, Portland International Airport and the Columbia Corridor, via light rail or bus.&nbsp;Finally,&nbsp;the project will connect to major community open spaces including Gateway Discovery Park, Kelly Butte,&nbsp;Glenfair&nbsp;Park,&nbsp;Parklane&nbsp;Park&nbsp;and eight additional neighborhood parks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As part of this project PBOT intends to:&nbsp;</p>

<p>These pricing changes come as the BIKETOWN service area&rsquo;s eastern border expands to serve east side Portland neighborhoods along the 50s Bikeway including Grant Park, Creston-Kenilworth, Laurelhurst, Beaumont-Wilshire, Cully, and Hollywood -- an area in which residents had been particularly calling for service.</p>
<p>The Community Cycling Center, which supports the Cully active transportation group Andando en Bicicletas en Cully (ABC), was &ldquo;overjoyed&rdquo; for the expansion. &ldquo;Adding the option of bike share near the Hacienda CDC community addresses barriers the ABC group has long identified, including start-up costs, storage, and maintenance,&rdquo; said<strong> Jonnie Ling, Director of Programs and Enterprise at the Community Cycling Center</strong>.</p>
<p>Following a successful May pilot, BIKETOWN members on an annual plan will be allowed to lock a bike to <em>any</em> public bike rack in the entire service area for free. Additionally, approximately 22 city bike corrals in the expansion area will be designated as &ldquo;Community Corrals,&rdquo; which function like BIKETOWN stations as free places to lock up for pay-as-you-go and monthly riders.</p>
<p>New to the Pay as You Go plan is the option to check out up to four bikes on one account. Current BIKETOWN members will receive an email on June 1 with instructions for how they can upgrade their plan.</p>
<p>BIKETOWN previously cost $144 for an annual membership or $2.50 for a single ride with an additional $0.10/min for all rides over 90 minutes. All single ride members will automatically convert to members of the Pay as You Go plan (with the sign-up fee waived), while annual and group members can choose to stay on their existing plans. BIKETOWN for All members will continue to pay just $3/month and incur no additional fees.</p>
<p>Launching in July 2016, orange BIKETOWN bikes are now a key part of bicycling culture in Portland, the city with the highest bike commute rate among major U.S. cities. Over the last two years, BIKETOWN riders have logged over 617,000 trips and 1,250,000 miles. Survey data shows that 25% of trips are replacing auto trips among local residents, helping to reduce Portland&rsquo;s congestion and carbon emissions.</p>

<p class=""gdp"">Run With Paula is an event firm owned by Paula and Dave Harkin. The award-winning event operator has created and run a variety of successful distance-running events in the Portland area, including the Hippie Chick and Helvetia half marathons in Washington County. The couple also own Portland Running Co., where participants in Run with Paula's Beaverton Half Marathon, to be held on Sunday, will be picking up packets today until 3 p.m.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">&ldquo;I believe our great city deserves an equally great race,"" Paula Harkin said. ""Fall just would not be the same without a marathon in Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">In recent weeks, several event producers contacted the City of Portland, expressing an interest in hosting a marathon in 2018. In order to choose a qualified producer within the short time frame remaining, the City created a streamlined process to select an organizer for a 2018 event.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Interested applicants were asked to respond to seven questions that assess whether they have the experience, organizational capacity and financial resources necessary to successfully organize a marathon in 2018. Responses were due on May 25.</p>

News,686828,News Release: Major milestone reached in making Portland's streets and sidewalks more accessible,1,,2018-06-06 00:17:45 UTC,2018-06-06 00:17:00 UTC,A,,"<p class=""gd_p"">(June 5, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation announced a major milestone in the City's efforts to make Portland's streets and sidewalks more accessible to people with mobility disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Yesterday, United States District Court Judge Marco Hernandez issued a preliminary approval of the settlement in Hines, et al. v. City of Portland. The class action seeks to ensure that the City's corners are ADA compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland has over 38,000 corners. Approximately 11,000 corners do not have curb ramps. Many other corners have ramps that do not meet current ADA standards.&nbsp; Corners that do not have ADA compliant curb ramps represent a significant barrier to safe and convenient mobility for people with mobility disabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">This landmark settlement will take a major step forward in correcting this situation. According to the settlement's terms, the City of Portland has agreed to construct and/or upgrade 1500 curb ramps per year for the next twelve years for a total of 18,000 ramps. The City has also agreed to survey all ramps in the next two years and establish a Transition Plan to map out how the City will ensure accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""On behalf of City Council, I would like to thank the claimants for working with us on this, in partnership, to provide an accessible City for all,"" said Mayor Ted Wheeler. ""Bringing our street corners up to compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act is the right, equitable and legal thing to do.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""We have nearly 40,000 corners in Portland,"" said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. ""Each corner is an opportunity. With the correct curb ramps, each of these corners represents a chance for our city to provide safe and accessible mobility to for all Portlanders regardless of whether they are living with a disability or not. That is why I am so supportive of this settlement. Thanks to this settlement, we will double the number of ADA compliant curb ramps we build each year and do a better job of putting our values of fair and safe access for all into practice.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Under this settlement, the City of Portland will make substantial improvements to the accessibility of its pedestrian right of way for residents and visitors with mobility disabilities by installing and upgrading about 18,000 curb ramps over the next 12 years &ndash; double the rate of recent installations and upgrades,&rdquo; said Plaintiffs&rsquo; counsel Linda Dardarian of Goldstein, Borgen, Dardarian &amp; Ho. &ldquo;This settlement was achieved collaboratively without a lawsuit, and has built a relationship of trust and open communication between representatives of the City and the community of people with mobility disabilities that will last for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Federal and state disability access laws were enacted decades ago to provide persons with disabilities an equal opportunity to fully participate in civic life,&rdquo; said Tim Fox, claimants&rsquo; counsel and co-founder of the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center.&nbsp; &ldquo;Today, we stand together with the City of Portland to fulfill the promise of those laws by ensuring that people with disabilities can travel independently throughout their communities.&nbsp; Inaccessible curb ramps prevent persons with disabilities from being fully integrated in their communities.&nbsp; This settlement goes a long way toward addressing those issues in that it will result in new ramps being put in at corners where there are no ramps and it will result noncompliant ramps being brought into compliance.&nbsp; This settlement will make Portland accessible to all persons regardless of disability and means a tremendous amount to me as a person with a disability who has come to love this city.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Portland resident Tess Raunig, one of the Plaintiffs in the case, said, &ldquo;Nonexistent and noncompliant curb ramps have made it hard for me to move freely around my neighborhood or to get to know my neighbors, and have even put me at risk of falling out of my wheelchair into the street.&nbsp; This settlement will prevent other people from having to experience that, and is a blessing for residents and visitors with disabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;This settlement means a lot to me and to persons with disabilities who want to live independently in our community,&rdquo; added Portland resident Allen Hines, another Plaintiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are several neighborhoods in this City where it is nearly impossible for a person in a mobility device to navigate the neighborhood.&nbsp; I am hopeful that with this settlement, we will make all of our neighborhoods in Portland accessible to people with mobility disabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">People with disabilities are the largest minority group in the country &ndash; census figures estimate that 56.7 million, or 1 in 5, Americans have a disability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">With the preliminary approval granted, the members of the class will be notified of the settlement. At a subsequent hearing, a judge will rule on the final status of the settlement. This hearing is anticipated to take place September 24, 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(June 14, 2018) Beginning in the summer of 2018, approximately 88 safety and improvement projects will begin to be built with the $8 million in funding from&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets.</a></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=f63985bf53974691bbe895a0e8e9e5c0&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">projects</a>&nbsp;were chosen after an extensive, year-long public engagement process by Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) Safe Routes to School program staff with school communities and a Stakeholder Advisory Committee made up of community partners and SRTS practitioners. Staff engaged families and students to identify the walking routes they take to school, and what types of traffic concerns they encountered along those routes. This information helped create the project list and a network of Primary Investment Routes where PBOT will prioritize investments in years to come. In total, Safe Routes identified over 1,200 projects along the Primary Investment Routes throughout the city. Projects not funded by Fixing Our Streets will be incorporated into and built by other planned City improvements or will need additional funding to be implemented.</p>
<p>Parents preferred different types of streets for their children in different parts of the city. Some prefer their children to walk on quiet back streets; in other neighborhoods, parents prefer their children walk on streets where more people are around. In areas where there are already sidewalks and good access, the most stressful part of getting to school is interacting with parents dropping students off by car. Overall, families want to see more emphasis on safety at arrival and dismissal times.&nbsp;Across Portland, the top concern heard by PBOT staff was unsafe crossings. Parents and students noted that major street crossings were the biggest barrier in walking to school. Missing sidewalks and traffic speed were also major safety concerns. Students and families confirmed that they prefer to take the shortest path and not to walk more than one or two blocks out of their way to use a better route or crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 88 projects were chosen in partnership with a Stakeholder Advisory Committee of schools, government agencies and community partners based on the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equity:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Low-income households</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Communities of color</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Limited English Proficiency households</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Safety:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Speed limit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of traffic lanes</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether the street is on the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/54892?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero High Crash Network, where more than half of deadly and serious injury crashes occur in Portland</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Student/route density:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Percentage of students living within 0.5 and 1 mile of school</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Number of schools served by the project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Construction of the Fixing Our Streets Safe Routes to School projects will begin in the summer of 2018 and should be completed by 2021. Some of the types of projects being installed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve crossing: An intersection project that goes beyond painting a crosswalk. This may include a median island, curb extension, flashing beacons, or traffic signal.</li>
<li>Mark or update crosswalk: Paints a crosswalk where none exists, or improves an existing crosswalk.</li>
<li>Evaluate traffic signals: Reviews an existing intersection with a traffic signal on a major street to identify changes that may improve safety, such as signal timing.</li>
<li>Construct walkway: Builds a sidewalk or other type of path along the roadway to separate people walking from cars.</li>
<li>Construct shared use path: Builds a path for people to walk or bike on that is not necessarily along a street.</li>
<li>Slow traffic speeds: Installs speed humps or changes street design to slow traffic through residential areas.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next year, PBOT will be adding routes and projects for schools that were not open or scheduled to be built when the project started. An example is Kellogg Middle School, which was approved for a rebuild in the PPS May 2017 Health, Safety and Modernization Bond.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School staff are excited to share the Fixing Our Streets Safe Routes to School map of Primary Investment Routes for each permanent public elementary, K-8, and middle school and identified safety projects along those routes.

<p>Background</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/68009?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Safe Routes to School initiative</a>&nbsp;(SRTS) is a comprehensive equity-focused program to improve walking and biking conditions around schools. Partnerships and collaboration with schools, community organizations, regional agencies, and neighborhoods are central to the program&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>Safe Routes uses infrastructure improvements (such as crosswalks) and educational campaigns to improve safety, reduce congestion, and encourage physical activity.</p>
<p>Safe Routes envisions a future where all students and families can choose active transportation as a safe, convenient, accessible and desirable option for getting to and from school and around their neighborhoods. The ability to walk, bike and roll to school and throughout neighborhoods not only benefits students and families, but the entire community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets and Safe Routes to School</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program allocated $8 million for to make routes safer and more convenient for kids to walk, bike and roll to school. With over 100 schools through the city, the need for street improvements to support safe travel to school is greater than the Fixing Our Streets funds available. Fixing Our Streets tasked SRTS to find out what changes Portlanders would like to see around their schools, and develop a process to target and prioritize safety investments.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(June 19, 2018) Improvements are on their way to SE Foster Road as the Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project kicks off this week. Crews will be doing night work on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights from approximately 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. to restripe Foster from SE 52nd Avenue to SE 82nd Avenue to create a new center turn lane. One lane in each direction will be open for travel during the restriping.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The road restriping will reconfigure the travel lanes on Foster Road to one lane each direction with a center turn lane, which will provide the space for future construction of the planned median refuge islands.</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">The Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project will deliver a street that is safer and more attractive for people walking, biking, taking transit and driving. With improved crosswalks and other safety features, modern signals, new pavement, 190 street trees and new decorative street lights, the project will transform Foster Road into an inviting thoroughfare that supports a vibrant commercial district and enhances the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The project extends from SE 50th Avenue to the western edge of the Lents Town Center at SE 90th Avenue. The changes to the street and urban design will transform Foster Road from a high-speed, auto-oriented corridor into a more balanced streetscape that is safer and more accessible for people walking, biking, taking public transit and driving. Additionally, the new design will support and enhance the growing mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>(June 22, 2018) Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman and Portland Bureau of Transportation Director Leah Treat joined community members today to celebrate the completion of three new sidewalk projects in East Portland.</p>
<p>The projects,&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71436?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">funded by the Fixing Our Streets program</a>, close critical gaps in sidewalks along SE Flavel Street, NE 102nd Avenue and SE 112th Avenue and add 16 new ADA-compliant curb ramps. By closing the gaps between existing sidewalks, the project creates a full 2.25 miles of streets in East Portland with complete sidewalks on both sides on the street. The result is safer access for neighborhood residents to schools, public transit and work.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The sidewalks were engineered by Emerio Design and constructed by Raimore Construction, both of which are local minority contractors. The estimated cost for the projects was $1.3 million, but final project costs were 33 percent under budget &ndash; with the total coming in under $900,000.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""As we promised Portlanders, we're putting their dime to work.""&nbsp;said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman.&nbsp;""Thanks to the voter-approved Fixing our Streets program, we're making it easier and safer for people here in East Portland to walk in the neighborhoods, visit local businesses and access the Springwater Corridor.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""These sidewalks&nbsp;have transformed&nbsp;the&nbsp;muddy trails on major thoroughfares&nbsp;that residents have relied on for years&nbsp;and made them into accessible pathways to local businesses, public transit stops and parks,"" said Leah Treat, director of the Portland Bureau of Transportation. ""I am especially pleased that these projects have help us grow our partnership with two local, minority-owned firms in Portland &ndash;&nbsp; Emerio Design and Raimore Construction. They worked swiftly to complete this work with the minimum possible impacts for our neighbors and the traveling public, and at a competitive price.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/588992?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">NE 102nd</a>, the new sidewalks provide a much-needed safety improvement. 102nd Avenue is one of the most dangerous streets in Portland for pedestrians. PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action plan ranks it in among the top 20 streets where pedestrians are killed or injured. The sidewalk provides a seamless walking route between Prescott Elementary and the Gateway Transit Center.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">On&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/588993?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SE 112th</a>, the new sidewalks improve walking connections along a large north-south corridor and connect destinations like Kelly Butte Natural Area, Floyd Light Middle School and Mall 205. On&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/588994?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SE Flavel</a>, new sidewalks make it safer to walk to the MAX Green Line, the I-205 Multiuse Path, the Springwater Corridor as well as shops and restaurants on 82nd Avenue. All three projects were identified in the East Portland in Motion plan as having strong community support but remained unfunded until voters approved Measure 26-173, which created the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets Program</a>.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Fixing Our Streets projects make up approximately 20 percent of the investments in Portland&rsquo;s transportation infrastructure this construction season, with a total of approximately $105 million being invested in capital projects, street repair and safety between now and September 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Fixing Our Streets program,&nbsp;paid for by a local gas tax approved by Portland voters in May 2016 and a heavy vehicle use tax, is Portland&rsquo;s first street repair and traffic safety program financed with local funding. 56 percent of Fixing Our Streets funding is invested in street maintenance and 44 percent is invested in safety improvements. The City Council ordinance included a project list that shows specific projects that are intended to be funded.

Passed on May 17, 2016, Measure 26-173 will raise an estimated $64 million over four years.&nbsp;PBOT will invest this money in a wide variety of street improvement and safety projects across the entire city. Fixing Our Streets will help PBOT expand preventive street maintenance that saves money and prevents potholes. It will support our work to make it safer for children to walk to school. It will allow us to build more sidewalks, traffic signals, street lights and bike lanes.&nbsp;The Portland City Council also unanimously passed a Heavy Vehicle Use Tax, for vehicles weighing more than 26,000 pounds, which will also fund the Fixing Our Streets program.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/689022

<p class=""x_gd_p"" style=""text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px; color: #000000;"">A year ago, Portland experienced a string of deadly traffic crashes around the Fourth of July holiday weekend. Seven people died in six days from June 28 to July 3, 2017.</p>

At about 10:15 p.m., Patrick, 23, was in a crash on SE 122nd Ave. and died a short time later.</p>

The closure will help create safe access for people to travel to and around the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.waterfrontbluesfest.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Waterfront Blues Festival</a>.&nbsp;This is the third year PBOT has implemented this closure for the safety of festival-goers.&nbsp;The Hawthorne Bridge will remain open to all users.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To support the on-ramp closure, one right turn lane will be closed on SW Harbor Drive and one northbound travel lane on SW Naito Parkway will be removed starting at SW Market Street. Motor vehicle traffic heading northbound on SW Naito Parkway to the Hawthorne Bridge will be detoured to the Hawthorne Bridge on-ramp on SW Madison Street. The detour route will direct northbound motor vehicle traffic on SW Naito Parkway to turn west onto SW Clay Street, then north on SW 2nd Avenue, turn east onto SW Madison Street, and onto to the Hawthorne Bridge.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.waterfrontbluesfest.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Waterfront Blues Festival</a>&nbsp;is expected to draw 100,000 people between July 4 to July 7; roughly 25,000 people per day. The northbound single lane conversion and Hawthorne Bridge on-ramp closure is intended to create a safer way for people to get to and around Waterfront Park and will connect with the existing&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.betternaito.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Better Naito</a>configuration.&nbsp;During the Festival, Better Naito will extend an additional four blocks from SW Main Street to SW Clay Street.&nbsp;</p>

News,690215,News Release: PBOT launches application for four-month e-scooter pilot program,1,,2018-07-05 16:48:42 UTC,2018-07-05 16:45:00 UTC,A,"The first such pilot in Oregon, shared electric scooters could begin operating in Portland by the end of July.","<p class=""gd_p"">(July 5, 2018) Permit applications for the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s 120-day&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/77294?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Shared Electric Scooter Pilot Program</a>&nbsp;opened today, inviting shared electric scooter companies to apply to participate in the program. The first such pilot in Oregon, shared electric scooters could begin operating in Portland by the end of July.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Transportation Bureau will use the 120-day pilot to help the City determine whether&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/77294?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Shared Electric Scooters</a>, also known as e-scooters, can support Portland&rsquo;s mobility, equity, safety, and climate action goals. The total number of e-scooters allowed to operate in the city will be capped at 2,500, with a requirement that companies deploy approximately 20 percent of their fleet each day in East Portland. Applications for participating in the pilot are due by July 12, with permit issuance scheduled for late July.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Throughout the Pilot Program, Shared Scooter companies will be expected to report on and mitigate impacts in several areas of concern. These include (but are not limited to): Safety and access for people walking, safety and access for people with disabilities and compliance with state law (including helmet requirements and the prohibition on sidewalk riding).</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Through public engagement and program evaluation, City officials will determine whether and under what circumstances electric scooter sharing may be permitted to continue operating in the public right-of-way after the Pilot Program has ended. The bureau will use anonymized trip data analysis, user surveys, and intercept surveys to understand the potential benefits and burdens of e-scooter operations in Portland in relation to the City&rsquo;s equity, mobility, and climate action goals.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Shared Electric Scooters are an emerging technology and shared mobility service. The first systems in the U.S. launched in 2017. Like bikeshare programs, the service provides scooters available to rent for one-way trips for a fee. To begin a rental, companies typically require customers to download an app or text a number to unlock the device. To end a trip, customers park the scooter in the service area in the furnishings zone. The scooters typically do not lock to anything.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Electric scooters are powered exclusively by an electric motor, and in Portland, companies will be required to cap the maximum speed to 15 MPH.&nbsp;Per State law, people using electric scooters are allowed on Portland city streets, multi-use paths and in bike lanes. Oregon Vehicle Code prohibits people using electric scooter on the sidewalk and in crosswalks. In addition, people using electric scooters are required to wear a bicycle helmet. Youth under age 16 are prohibited from riding electric scooters. While riding an electric scooter, users are required to yield to people walking and people with disabilities.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/690215

<p class=""gd_p"">Work will begin on July 9 on the north side of Foster Road (westbound) between SE 84th/Ellis to approximately SE 89th Ave and will last for approximately two weeks. During all hours and all days, only one lane of travel will be open in each direction on Foster Road, as well as intersections at SE Ellis Street and SE 84th Avenue. All other north side street connections (SE 86th, SE 87th, and SE 88th) will be closed for the two week construction period. During the south side construction, beginning on approximately July 23 and lasting for two weeks, south side street connections (SE 85th, SE 86th, SE 87th and SE 88th) will be closed for the duration of the work. ADA accessible pedestrian crossings will be provided at SE 82nd, SE 87th and SE 90th during road construction. This work is weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Road excavation and construction for the portion of Foster Road from SE 82nd to SE Ellis/84th Avenue will occur in August.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">During construction, PBOT asks the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project will deliver a street that is safer and more attractive for people walking, biking, taking transit and driving. With improved crosswalks and other safety features, wider sidewalks, modern signals, new pavement, 190 street trees and new decorative street lights, the project will transform Foster Road into an inviting thoroughfare that supports a vibrant commercial district and enhances the quality of life in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The project extends from SE 50th Avenue to the western edge of the Lents Town Center at SE 91st Avenue. The changes to the street and urban design will transform Foster Road from a high-speed, auto-oriented corridor into a more balanced streetscape that is safer and more accessible for people walking, biking, taking public transit and driving. Additionally, the new design will support and enhance the growing mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Funding for the $9 million project comes from the Fixing our Streets Program, the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal District, Portland Transportation System Development Charges and a Metro grant.

<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;""As an organization that is deeply committed to the health of our communities, we at Kaiser Permanente are especially excited about the vision for Portland's Green Loop,"" said Dan Field, Executive Director of Community Health and Public Affairs for Kaiser Permanente Northwest. ""More trees, fresh air and a safer route to commute will inspire more physical activity, less pollution, and so many benefits that will have a direct impact on the mental and physical well-being of our citizens. As the presenting sponsor of Sunday Parkways for over a decade, we're a huge proponent of the Green Loop and we can&rsquo;t wait to get a sneak peek on July 22.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, as well as many of its supporting partners including Go Lloyd, Albina Vision Trust and others will be available at Sunday Parkways to answer participants' questions about projects related to or adjacent to the Green Loop and to receive feedback.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sunday's route will also feature the launch of the first ever river marketplace,&nbsp;Sunday Splashways, located at Audrey McCall Beach. Willie Levenson, Ringleader for the Human Access Project, and co-coordinator for the river side event is excited for its incorporation in the Sunday Parkways on the Green Loop event. &ldquo;At 4,000 acres the Willamette River is our second largest open space and natural area. The Willamette River is the heart of our city and our cities blue space,&rdquo; said Levenson.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">There is a lot to see at Sunday Parkways on the Green Loop.&nbsp; Sticker Hunt participants who complete their Sticker Hunt maps&nbsp;will not only also receive a collectible neighborhood decal as a prize (Sunday Parkways on the Green Loop decal shown above) but will also be contributing to a good cause. For each map completed by a participant, Kaiser Permanente will make a $5 donation to one of three local mental health organizations.

News,693726,Traffic Advisory:  Ramp connecting SW Capitol Highway to SW Barbur Boulevard closed until August 27 for repairs to bridge deck,1,,2018-08-08 22:22:58 UTC,2018-07-20 22:21:00 UTC,A,"SW Barbur Blvd has one lane closed, southbound near the interchange","<p>(July 20, 2018) An eight-inch hole in the deck of the flyover ramp connecting eastbound SW Capitol Highway to northbound SW Barbur Boulevard will close the ramp for repairs until August 27, 2018. The hole in the bridge was discovered on Thursday. The bridge was immediately closed to all traffic at the intersection of SW Capitol Highway at SW Terwilliger Boulevard.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The 554-foot-long and almost 60-year-old bridge will require repairs that will take approximately five weeks, as crews remove and replace failing concrete in the bridge deck.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The steel-and-concrete girder bridge is owned by the Portland Bureau of Transportation. Based on National Bridge Inspection Standards, the Oregon Department of Transportation inspects this and all other public, traffic carrying bridges in Oregon every two years. The bridge is due for its next inspection this September.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">People driving eastbound on SW Capitol Highway and SW Beaverton Hillsdale should follow detour signage directing them to SW Bertha Boulevard to access SW Barbur Boulevard northbound.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The outside (right) lane of southbound SW Barbur Boulevard is closed from before the offramp to westbound SW Capitol Highway. However, right turns to westbound SW Capitol Highway are still allowed at this time.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The traveling public is advised to expect delays while repairs are being made. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.</p>

News,693727,News Release:  PBOT issues first e-scooter permits as part of new pilot program,1,,2018-08-08 22:24:08 UTC,2018-07-25 22:23:00 UTC,A,"With permits issued, e-scooters will soon be available on Portland's streets","<p class=""gd_p"">(July 25, 2018) Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation issued the first two permits to operate shared electric scooters in Portland. The permits were issued to the companies Skip and Bird. PBOT officials said they expected that scooters could be available for rent as soon as this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The permits were issued as part of PBOT's recently launched Shared Scooter Pilot Program. The 120 day pilot program runs until November 20th. Through the pilot program, PBOT created a temporary scooter permit to allow companies to offer scooters for rent. Both during and after the pilot, PBOT will conduct an evaluation of the program, including surveying Portlanders, to determine whether scooters are compatible with the safe, efficient and equitable operation of Portland's transportation system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/07/2059067/2105053/20170719-pbot-escooter-handbill-1_crop.png"" alt=""Handbill"" width=""590"" height=""228"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">""I'm very happy we were able to stand up this pilot as quickly as we did,"" said Interim Transportation Director Chris Warner. 'This is a rapidly changing industry, and we wanted to be flexible and nimble in setting up this pilot. Portlanders will now have a chance to try this new way of getting around, and we'll have the opportunity to see if scooters work in Portland and help us meet our safety, mobility, equity and climate action goals.""</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The pilot program sets specific conditions for the deployment of scooters in the city. The total number of scooters will be capped at 2,500 with each permitted company allowed a share of this total. Companies may deploy up to 200 scooters during its first week of operation. To further citywide equity goals, PBOT requires that each company deploy a portion of their fleets in East Portland.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">By state law, scooter riders must wear a helmet and cannot ride on sidewalks. According to the city code, the scooters cannot be used in city parks. Riders will be required to park scooters on the sidewalk close to the curb, so that scooters do not interfere with pedestrians. As a condition of receiving a permit, companies are required to educate riders about safe riding and proper parking behavior. PBOT will also conduct education actions to inform riders about the rules of the road.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">PBOT will continue to issue permits to companies that qualify under the pilot rules.&nbsp;</p>

<div class=""gd_p content-center"">BBAC members with PBOT Director Leah Treat and PBOT staff, June 21, 2018.</div>
<p class=""gd_p"">(July 24, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee recently held their final meeting for the 2017-18 fiscal year, marking the end of a productive period discussing city transportation issues and shaping the bureau&rsquo;s operating budget.</p>
<p class=""gd_p""><a href=""/transportation/68958?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">The Committee</a>&nbsp;is a dynamic, volunteer group, comprised mainly of leaders representing a range of interests and voices impacted by transportation decisions, including community groups, neighborhoods, businesses, labor union, advocacy groups and traditionally underserved communities in Portland. The group is charged with the task of informing PBOT&rsquo;s annual transportation budget and providing sound recommendations to the PBOT Director.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">From September 2017 to June 2018, Committee members met on the third Thursday of every month to discuss PBOT&rsquo;s 2018-2019 budget and provide input on different transportation related topics including but not limited to the Portland Citywide Pedestrian Plan, Enhanced Transit Corridors Plan, Congestion Pricing, PBOT&rsquo;s Fixing Our Streets program, PBOT&rsquo;s Equity Plan and Transportation Systems Plan.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Committee members also took actionable steps, resulting in positive outcomes. In March, for instance, at the transportation budget workshop session, BBAC members asked the City to build staff capacity, provide additional funds and resources to support the City&rsquo;s Vision Zero plans and refrain from making cuts to the ADA sidewalk repair program. The BBAC&rsquo;s message was very well received by City Commissioners and echoed by many stakeholders during the budget deliberation process.</p>
<h2>Committee Co-Chairs Reflect on a Year of Leadership</h2>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Bureau and Budget Advisory is co-chaired by Momoko Saunders and Tony Lamb. We asked each of them to share information about their leadership experience and the PBOT Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee.</p>

<h2>Momoko Saunders</h2>
<h3>How would you describe the PBOT Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee to someone you are meeting for the first time?&#8239;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The BBAC is a committee of various community members who advise the Bureau on its budget. While our main responsibility is to write a letter to the commissioners expressing thoughts on the proposed&#8239;upcoming budget, we also hear presentations on various projects and policy issues. We are able to express concerns and give perspectives that might not otherwise be considered. We are also often asked to attend community outreach events and to encourage our own communities to engage with these events.&#8239;</p>
<h3>As a Portland resident, what has been the most meaningful part of serving on the BBAC?</h3>
<p>My experience on the BBAC has been very educational. I have spent much of my time deep diving into all the various funding buckets and where and how they are spent on Portland's transportation. My leadership role is largely one of facilitation. It is my responsibility to ensure that committee members feel supported in expressing their concerns and that we have productive meetings.&#8239;The most meaningful part of serving on the BBAC for me personally is the ability to get to know the people who are working on the projects directly affecting my community. I am able to share the access I have to staff with others who cannot attend the BBAC meetings. There are so many voices which want to be included and heard. It's great to feel like you are helping facilitate conversations that wouldn't normally be able to happen.&#8239;</p>
<h3>What were some of the recurring themes that featured prominently at BBAC meetings during the past year?</h3>
<p>The prevailing themes of BBAC meetings include equity and safety. There is a general agreement that certain areas of Portland have been historically overlooked while planning for transportation development. We try to see everything through the lens of ""who are we not considering in these proposals"". Will this project or change in policy further us in our Vision Zero strategy?&#8239;What were some of the recurring themes that featured prominently at BBAC meetings during the past year?</p>
<h3>What are the most important leadership lessons you learned as the co-chair of the PBOT Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee?&#8239;</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">I've learned the importance of teamwork and the value of solid preparation for meetings. We have a planning meeting before each committee&#8239;meeting where we go over the agenda in detail. I'm grateful&#8239;to PBOT staff for their organization and readiness to supply committee members with pertinent documents related to agenda topics before the meetings. I also value my co-chair, who's facilitation skills helped make even the thorniest of topics productive conversations.</p>

<h2>Tony Lamb</h2>
<h3>How would you describe the PBOT Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee to someone you are meeting for the first time?</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">BBAC is a group of community members, PBOT staff and leadership, and transportation advocates providing guidance and oversight for the bureau. The group discuss upcoming projects, policy issues, budget guidance and community concerns.&nbsp;It's really an eclectic group of folks who are passionate about transportation and a desire for Portland to have not only the best, but also the safest multi-modal system in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>As a Portland resident, what has been the most meaningful part of serving on the BBAC?</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">I've had the amazing opportunity to meet and connect with so many amazing folks from the transportation community. Being able to learn, grow and challenge some of my own assumptions and perspectives while refining my leadership abilities has been one of the experiences most valuable to me this past year. I've really enjoyed getting to understand projects from a broad prospective and seeing all the hard work from PBOT staff and leadership that goes into our transportation system. I've been blown away by how committed and professional both BBAC members and PBOT staff been throughout my time serving.</p>
<h3>What were the recurring themes that featured prominently at BBAC meetings during the past year?</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">I think there were a couple recurring themes that came up throughout the year, but especially during budget discussions. Equity was a big theme that came up throughout the year with a strong desire to see it frame all the work at PBOT.&nbsp;Ensuring the benefits of upcoming infrastructure investments reach our MWESB sector and communities of East Portland were key.&nbsp;Realizing&nbsp;Vision Zero and safe complete streets are a pretty big deal to the BBAC.&nbsp; Making sure our sidewalks are ADA compliant throughout the city was another area of focus for members this year.&nbsp;A particular issue that was important during the budget session was the preservation of PBOT jobs within the street cleaning program and seeing that happen was pretty fun.</p>
<h3>What are the most important leadership lessons you learned as the co-chair of the PBOT Bureau and Budget Advisory Committee?</h3>
<p class=""gd_p"">For me, I would say that active listening, group facilitation and working as a team were pretty big lessons I learned as co-chair this year. I really have to thank my co-chair, PBOT staff, and fellow BBAC members for all their support this past year.&nbsp;Without them, there is no way this year could have gone as smooth and successful as it did. I would also like to thank Leah Treat for all her direction and guidance over the past few years at the bureau and setting it up for continued success in the future.</p>

The contest was open to students from Pre-Kindergarten to 12th grade. For years Portlanders have enjoyed the smile-inducing bike lane art designed by PBOT&rsquo;s striping crews. The designs, which are usually created by crew members, can be found in bike lanes and on neighborhood greenways across the city. The Bike to Books Coloring contest asked students to come up with their own original bike lane art that they would like to see in Portland's bike lanes.</p>

<p class=""gd_p content-left"">(Aug.&nbsp;2, 2018)&nbsp;Our&nbsp;<a href=""http://bit.ly/PDXNWIM?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Northwest in Motion online open</a>&nbsp;house is underway and we want to hear from you! How can we expand opportunities for people to comfortably walk, bike, and take public transit in and around the Northwest District neighborhood? Your feedback will help&nbsp;the Portland Bureau of Transportation&nbsp;create a list of specific projects that we can build in and around the neighborhood over the next five years. The online open house includes an interactive comment map where you can point out specific issues that you would like PBOT to address. There are only&nbsp;nine&nbsp;days left to give us your feedback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">This project will focus on small-scale improvements that could be built in the next five years to fill the gaps and deficiencies in the existing biking and walking network and promote increased transit ridership in the Northwest District. These projects could include improvements like:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Marked crosswalks&nbsp;</li>
<li>Curb extensions&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sidewalk improvements&nbsp;</li>
<li>New and improved bike routes&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Transit stop improvements&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><a href=""/transportation/76131?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Northwest In Motion</a>&nbsp;will develop a five-year active transportation implementation strategy to provide walking, bicycling, and&nbsp;public&nbsp;transit improvements in the Northwest District&nbsp;neighborhood, a&nbsp;vibrant area that is rapidly growing with&nbsp;housing and jobs&nbsp;in inner Northwest&nbsp;Portland. The plan will identify, develop, and prioritize multimodal transportation investments to provide safety for vulnerable roadway users, reduce conflict between&nbsp;transportation&nbsp;modes, and give people living and working in the district more transportation options. Major outcomes include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A prioritized list of walking, bicycling, and transit projects to guide investment of parking meter revenue and other funding&nbsp;</li>
<li>A feasible strategy for upgrading existing neighborhood greenways in NW to meet established neighborhood greenway guidelines&nbsp;</li>
<li>Changes to street classifications and designs to clarify modal priorities and support the overall goals of the project&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p""><a href=""/transportation/76131?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Northwest in Motion</a>&nbsp;aims to give people more choices for daily travel. Giving people more transportation options like walking, bicycling, and public transit means they have the choice to bypass traffic congestion, use limited roadway space more efficiently, and avoid having to look for scarce on-street parking. Providing people these choices will be especially important as the neighborhood continues to grow as a residential, commercial, and employment destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gdp"">(August 15, 2018)&nbsp;The SW Capitol Highway flyover ramp&nbsp;connecting to SW Barbur Boulevard was&nbsp;reopened today at about 2 p.m.,&nbsp;after Portland Bureau of Transportation crews&nbsp;completed&nbsp;repairs to the structure nearly two weeks&nbsp;ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">A hole in the bridge, discovered on July 19, led to an immediate closure to all traffic with reopening set for August 27.&nbsp;Thanks to Portland Bureau of Transportation crews, deteriorated concrete around an eight-inch hole in the deck of the flyover ramp connecting eastbound SW Capitol Highway to northbound SW Barbur Boulevard was demolished and replaced over the course of three weeks. During the closure for the concrete repairs, City crews also repaired deteriorated concrete discovered at a second location, repaved the bridge approach, cleared clogged deck drains, and trimmed back overgrown vegetation.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gdp"">The 554-foot-long and almost 60-year-old steel-and-concrete girder bridge is owned by the Portland Bureau of Transportation.

<p>In keeping with the Portland Bureau of Transportation and Sunday Parkways&rsquo; ongoing partnership with Portland Parks &amp; Recreations&rsquo; Parks for New Portlanders,&nbsp;Sunday Parkways will co-host the second annual WALK with Refugees and Immigrants. This year the WALK falls on World Humanitarian Day, and participants include Mayor Ted Wheeler, Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Commissioner Chloe Eudaly and Ruth Williams-Brinkley, the president of Sunday Parkways&rsquo; presenting sponsor Kaiser Permanente Northwest.</p>
<p>The celebratory one-mile permitted walk will gather community members and elected leaders at 11 a.m. at Gateway Discovery Park and will conclude at Knott City Park at approximately 12:15 p.m. During the walk, traffic between Gateway Discovery Park and Knott City Park will be one-way on the Sunday Parkways route, with thousands of people walking. Participants who will not participate in the walk are encouraged to travel counter clockwise moving from Gateway Discovery Park towards East Holladay Park between 11:30 a.m. &ndash; 12:30 p.m. The WALK is open to the public and encourages all neighbors, faith-based organizations, local businesses, neighborhood associations, and nonprofits to join with its purpose to inspire a more compassionate, generous and welcoming Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once again, Sunday Parkways is bringing together all the things that Portland does best: Celebrating community, exploring neighborhoods and green spaces, and discovering new routes, bikeways and businesses that connect us all,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Dan Saltzman. &ldquo;With so many infrastructure projects slated for Outer Northeast in the next three years, you&rsquo;ll be sure to discover new and exciting improvements on your rides for years to come.&rdquo;&ldquo;This Sunday, I&rsquo;m proud to walk in solidarity with our immigrant and refugee communities to honor the rich diversity they bring to the fabric our neighborhoods,&rdquo; said Ruth Williams-Brinkley, president, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals of the Northwest. &ldquo;Portland is one of the Top 10 destinations for immigrants and refugees from across the globe. I am walking to embrace the spirit of diversity and inclusion that we hope defines our city and our nation, which was built by immigrants who came here to enjoy, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to introducing a new park, electric scooters will make their debut at this month&rsquo;s Sunday Parkways. During the event, e-scooter riders will be expected to follow state and city laws at Sunday Parkways - including wearing a helmet while operating the e-scooter and not riding on sidewalks or in City parks. Bird and Lime will set up next to Gateway Discovery Park and offer free helmets and demos of the new e-scooters.</p>
<p>This weekend&rsquo;s Sunday Parkways will highlight several of PBOT&rsquo;s upcoming infrastructure projects aimed at improving safety, access to transit, and bicycle connectivity. These projects, a combined investment of $21 million over the next three years, are expected to improve access to jobs, transit, education and economic opportunity. These projects include: Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project, Holladay-Oregon-Pacific (HOP) Neighborhood Greenway, 100s Neighborhood Greenway, 130s Neighborhood Greenway, and Outer Halsey Safety Improvements. Sunday Parkways is one of many engagement strategies PBOT is employing in this historically underinvested area to provide greater multimodal access for neighbors.

The seasonal protected space for people walking, biking and rolling is ending one week earlier than initially planned to accommodate Multnomah County&rsquo;s Burnside Bridge Maintenance Project. The project will repair sections of the Burnside Bridge during September and October, including the sections that are above Naito Parkway as well as the bike lanes, sidewalks and driveways under the bridge.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Since 2015, Better Naito has provided a protected space for pedestrians and cyclists traveling along Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park during its busiest season: summer. Every year the park hosts many of the region&rsquo;s largest festivals, drawing almost 700,000 visitors during the spring and summer, and over 15,000 people on the busiest days. In 2017, cyclists took almost 400,000 one-way trips on Better Naito. Better Naito will return for another season in 2019, with the installation tentatively scheduled for the last weekend of April.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&ldquo;Multnomah County has worked with its Burnside Bridge contractor, neighbors and PBOT to coordinate work on the bridge above Naito Parkway in September,&rdquo; said Multnomah County Spokesperson Mike Pullen. &ldquo;The schedule change minimizes impacts on the University of Oregon facility on the northwest side of the bridge and reduces costs and schedule impacts for the bridge repairs. We&rsquo;re thankful for the City&rsquo;s flexibility as we complete this important maintenance work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Signs informing the public of the closure and detour route will be installed in the coming weeks. The bollards delineating Better Naito from the adjacent northbound travel lane will be removed during the weekend of September 22-23.</p>

PBOT also released the 2018 Leaf Day schedule. The first day of this year's Leaf Day will be November 9th.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">For decades, the bureau has collected leaves and swept streets in designated Leaf Districts, locations that account for the vast majority of leaves that fall on city streets. In 2010, the bureau started charging a fee for the service to recover the city's costs during the Great Recession.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&ldquo;When a policy is not meeting its intended goal, we shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to reevaluate it and change course if necessary,&rdquo; said Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done with the Leaf Day fee. It never met its goal as a cost recovery measure. By ending it, we will save on administrative costs, our streets and storm drains will be cleared and Portlanders will have one less fee to pay.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">""This year, we're introducing a big change to Leaf Day. We're making it free,"" said Chris Warner,&nbsp;PBOT's Interim Director. ""We know the public appreciates this service, which keeps our streets safe for everyone and reduces the chance of street flooding. But the fee we started collecting in 2010 never met its goal of covering the city's costs. In addition, the cost of administering the fee have been quite significant, adding up to almost 20% of program costs.&nbsp;Finally, more and more Portlanders have opted out of the program over the years. Given all these factors, we decided it made financial and policy sense to return to providing this service free of charge.""&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class=""x_gd_p"">Learn more at <a href=""/leafday"">portlandoregon.gov/leafday</a></h2>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Portland's tree canopy covers a significant portion of the city. In autumn, wet fallen leaves can become very slick, creating potential hazards for people walking, biking, rolling or driving through tree-lined neighborhoods. Leaves can also clog storm drains and thus contribute to street flooding during heavy fall rains. To help address these hazards, city crews have been removing thousands of cubic yards of leaves from Portland streets for more than three decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Since 2010, PBOT charged residential customers $15 per leaf removal. Commercial and multi-family properties with over four units were charged $65 per removal.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">During the years when PBOT collected a leaf fee, the revenue never covered the operational and administrative costs of the program. In fact in the last five years, leaf fee revenues have covered less than 50% of program costs. Starting with this year's Leaf Day, leaf removal will be funded through general transportation dollars, much like other services such as snow and ice removal, pothole repairs and roadside vegetation clean-up.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Besides the end of the leaf fee, the other aspects of Leaf Day will not change. Starting&nbsp; November 9th, PBOT crews will remove leaves in 52 leaf districts across the city. Residents in the leaf districts should move their cars and other obstacles from the street and limb their street trees prior to their Leaf Day service to facilitate a more effective clean-up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Oct. 11, 2018)&nbsp;Another record-breaking season of Sunday Parkways has come to an end. With an estimated 125,000 participants over five events, the 2018 season was our biggest year yet!</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In addition to offering events on four pre-existing and beloved neighborhood routes in Southeast, North, Outer Northeast and Northeast Portland, the Portland Bureau of Transportation introduced the Green Loop route in July &ndash; taking 33,000 participants on an adventure through Portland&rsquo;s Central City. And, just like every year,&nbsp;each Parkways was filled with smiles, laughter, fun and hundreds upon thousands of first-time experiences that make this PBOT program the memory-making Portland institution it has become.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">After eleven seasons of Sunday Parkways,&nbsp;participants have shared lots of firsts:</p>
<ul>
<li>First time riding a bike with friends or family in the street</li>
<li>First visit to a new park or neighborhood</li>
<li>First taste from that food cart that is now your favorite</li>
<li>First ride or walk with thousands of fellow Portlanders</li>
<li>First time volunteering for a community event</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">But even after all these years, we still have new firsts to add to the list. Here are some of our favorite ""firsts"" from Sunday Parkways 2018:</p>
<ul>

<p class=""x_gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">(Oct. 17, 2018) Bloomberg Philanthropies today announced Portland as a winning city in the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge. The Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge is a $70 million program that will accelerate 20 ambitious cities&rsquo; efforts to tackle climate change and promote a sustainable future for residents.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Through the Climate Challenge &ndash; which is part of Bloomberg&rsquo;s American Cities Initiative, a suite of more than $200 million in investments to strengthen city halls and advance critical policies &ndash; the City of Portland is accepted into a two-year acceleration program, will be provided powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support to help meet or beat the City&rsquo;s near-term carbon reduction goals.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p""><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=700684"" alt=""American Cities Climate Challenge logo"" width=""250"" height=""60.5670103093"" />Bloomberg Philanthropies selected Portland as a winning city because of its innovative and ambitious climate action plans to reduce air pollution and city-wide emissions with specific projects aimed at reforming their respective transportation and buildings sectors, areas which are typically responsible for 90 percent of all citywide emissions and are areas over which mayors have significant authority. Bloomberg Philanthropies also recognizes Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly for their commitment to ambitious climate action and securing a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment and economy for their citizens.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">""Cities are helping to keep America moving forward on climate change despite the lack of leadership from Washington, and this challenge was designed to help innovative cities reach their goals,&rdquo; said Mike Bloomberg. &ldquo;We were looking for cities with ambitious and realistic plans to cut emissions in ways that improve people&rsquo;s lives, and mayors committed to getting the job done. Each of these winning cities brings those ingredients to the table - and we&rsquo;re looking forward to working with them and seeing what they can accomplish.""</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&ldquo;Portland has a long and proud history of leading on environmental initiatives,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited and honored to be a recipient of the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge grant. With these resources, we&rsquo;ll be able to develop and implement policies and programs that will keep Portland at the forefront of city leadership on climate issues. Now more than ever, this type of action at the city level is necessary if we are to seriously address the important and pressing issue of climate change.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&ldquo;The Portland Bureau of Transportation and the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability deserve credit for winning a highly competitive application process to become a&nbsp;Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge Leadership City,"" Eudaly said. ""I am looking forward to working with the Bloomberg team to reduce carbon pollution in our transportation system by managing congestion and making walking, biking, and using public transportation more attractive, safe options. Bloomberg&rsquo;s support, combined with the City of Portland&rsquo;s ongoing work and community-based initiatives like the Portland Clean Energy Fund, will enable us invest in innovative strategies that will improve our economy and our health as well as demonstrate how cities can lead the fight against climate change.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">The Portland Bureau of Transportation and the Portland Bureau of Planning and Sustainability are the two agencies that will receive the grant and technical assistance from Bloomberg Philanthropies.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Winners of the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge will be provided robust technical assistance and a support package valued at up to $2.5 million per city. Portland plans to use this support to reduce climate pollution in transportation and promote renewable energy use throughout the city.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Bloomberg Philanthropies will work the City to achieve the following actions by 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage congestion in the Central City with zero growth in single-occupant vehicle trips, expanding incentives such as the Transportation Wallet, that make it easier for all Portlanders to walk, bike or take public transport instead of drive;</li>
<li>Use apps and other new data sources to provide analysis and evaluation of the City's upcoming public transit and bicycle infrastructure investments;</li>
<li>Implement performance-based parking pricing and prioritize curb parking spaces to reduce congestion by encouraging higher-occupancy trips, such as public transit and carpools that use ride-sharing services;</li>
<li>Ensure City buildings are highly efficient and powered by clean, renewable energy, in order to reach our goal of all facilities being carbon-free by 2030;</li>
<li>Support the development of community-owned renewable energy projects like large solar arrays, especially within Portland&rsquo;s low-income communities and communities of color.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">As Climate Challenge winners, the 20 cities will be accepted into a two-year acceleration program with powerful new resources and access to cutting-edge support to help them meet &ndash; or beat &ndash; their near-term carbon reduction goals. These resources include a philanthropy-funded team member to facilitate the development and passage of high impact policies, training for senior leadership to assist with implementation of their proposed climate plans, and citizen engagement support to maximize community buy-in.</p>

PBOT also reminds Portlanders to use extra caution while traveling on city streets and sidewalks on Halloween.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=700707"" alt=""Vision Zero logo"" width=""250"" height=""250"" />Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk, whether it is marked or unmarked.&nbsp; People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>Children all across Portland will take to the streets to trick-or-treat for Halloween on Wednesday, Oct. 31. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that Halloween is consistently one of the top three days for pedestrian injuries and fatalities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that children are four times more likely to be struck by a motor vehicle on Halloween than any other day of the year. Because excited trick-or-treaters often forget about safety, people driving and parents accompanying children must be even more alert. Everyone should focus on being visible and watching out for other travelers. Add lights and reflectors to your child's costume - it's a fun and easy way to help keep children safe as they trick or treat.</p>
<p>People driving can do their part by driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed. People walking and bicycling are encouraged to be more visible by wearing retro-reflective clothing, using a flashlight or blinking strobe, and investing in bright and contrasting outerwear.&nbsp; Education and enforcement actions such as the Oct. 24 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>

<p>SE/NE Sandy Boulevard had two traffic fatalities (one pedestrian and one person in a motor vehicle), 30 serious injuries and 75 moderate and minor injuries in 2012-16, the latest five-year period for which complete crash data is available.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Oct. 24 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach its Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated person walking at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation.&nbsp; A PBOT staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

<p class=""x_gd_p""><a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTgxMDE5Ljk2NDQ3OTUxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE4MTAxOS45NjQ0Nzk1MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE3MzE1NDIyJmVtYWlsaWQ9Y2l0eXBpb2dyb3VwQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZ1c2VyaWQ9Y2l0eXBpb2dyb3VwQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;109&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/540587?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">The NW 20th Avenue LID Project</a>&nbsp;will reconnect the Slabtown neighborhood and Northwest Portland&nbsp;by extending NW 20th&nbsp;Avenue and NW Thurman Street at the normal street grade for the area, underneath the highway overpass. This will&nbsp;create a new intersection, improve traffic flow and bus service, and build a new, more efficient, route for people driving, walking and biking in this&nbsp;growing&nbsp;area.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">The project paves the way for build out of the Con-way Master Plan, unlocking more than $500 million in mixed-use housing development for an area comprised mostly of surface parking lots adjacent to&nbsp;St. Patrick&rsquo;s Catholic Church, the oldest Catholic Church in the Portland area.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">""I'm glad to see the Portland Bureau of Transportation collaborating with the private sector to build protected bike lanes, new street connections and housing options,"" said Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, who oversees PBOT. ""The NW 20th Avenue LID Project is a great example of the kind of public-private partnership that will help us manage growth. As we build more housing, it's important that we also build street improvements that make bus service faster, and make it safe and comfortable for people to bike and walk.""</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Property owners XPO, Esco and Cairn Pacific&nbsp;own a half-dozen city blocks surrounding NW Thurman and 19th Avenue. They are paying a combined $7.6 million for the street improvements, which give the properties more development potential.&nbsp;They worked with PBOT to form a Local Improvement District to organize the funding needed for the improvements.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">PBOT will contribute $1 million in system development charges, which are fees paid by developers to help offset the impact of population growth on the transportation system. The Bureau of Environmental Services will invest about $1 million for sewer construction, which will be coordinated with road construction so the roads don't have to be torn up twice.</p>
<p class=""x_gd_p"">Corpac Construction won the contract to build the road improvements. The project will have 82 percent participation of MWESB contracting, more than double the city's goal for contracting with minority-owned, women-owned and emerging small businesses.</p>

<p class=""x_gd_p""><strong>Street improvements include:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New NW 20th Avenue from NW Raleigh&nbsp;Street to&nbsp;NW Upshur Street;</li>
<li>Protected bike lanes on NW 20th&nbsp;Avenue (NW Raleigh St to Upshur St);</li>
<li>Protected bike lanes on NW Thurman&nbsp;St&nbsp;(NW 20th&nbsp;Ave to NW 19th&nbsp;Ave);</li>
<li>Relocated NW Thurman Street from NW 20th Avenue to NW 21st Avenue;</li>
<li>Replacement traffic signal for NW 23rd Avenue &amp; Vaughn St. &amp; U.S. Highway 30 intersection. This will improve traffic flow, and enable TriMet to extend bus Line 24 over the Fremont Bridge in spring 2019, connecting NE Portland to NW Portland and westbound MAX lines.</li>
<li>Modifications to NW 23rd Avenue &amp; Vaughn Street intersection at the U.S. 30 off-ramp;</li>
<li>Modifications to NW 23rd Avenue between NW Thurman Street and NW Vaughn Street.</li>

<li>U-turn from Westbound U.S. 30/ Fremont Bridge/I-405 to&nbsp;eastbound Vaughn Street connector&nbsp;CLOSED. This is a permanent closure, to be replaced by the new Thurman Street connection. This also will allow a new traffic signal at NW 23rd and Vaughn St, which will significantly reduce congestion on NW 23rd Avenue for northbound motor vehicle traffic including buses, accessing the U.S. 30 on-ramp.</li>
<li>Travelers westbound on U.S. 30 going to 19th&nbsp;and&nbsp;Vaughn&nbsp;St should go north on NW 23rd&nbsp;Avenue and take Wilson St and Vaughn St to NW 19th Avenue.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Travelers going between NW 23rd and NW 19th&nbsp;Avenues should plan to travel along NW Wilson St or Thurman and NW Raleigh Streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<div class=""gd_p content-center"">
<p class=""content-left"">(Oct.&nbsp;22, 2018)&nbsp;In the first major step&nbsp;of evaluating Portland&rsquo;s e-scooter pilot program, PBOT surveyed nearly 75,000 customers of Bird, Lime and Skip, the three companies permitted to operate e-scooters in Portland.&nbsp;The wide-ranging survey asked customers about their riding habits, their perceptions of scooter safety and popularity and&nbsp;whether&nbsp;they replaced car trips with scooter rides.&nbsp;More than 4,500 people&nbsp;responded,&nbsp;and the results suggest scooters&nbsp;are a popular&nbsp;new&nbsp;transit option for&nbsp;Portlanders&nbsp;and visitors alike.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">Among the key findings&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul class=""content-left"">
<li><strong>Portlanders are using e-scooters for transportation&nbsp;and recreation.&nbsp;</strong>Nearly a third (30&nbsp;percent) of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Portlanders&nbsp;who responded to the survey&nbsp;said they most frequently used&nbsp;e-scooters to commute&nbsp;&ndash; to get to work, school, or a work-related meeting.&nbsp;Another third (28 percent) stated they most frequently used e-scooters for fun/recreation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>E-scooters are popular with local users.</strong>&nbsp;Eighty-five percent of Portlanders said they&nbsp;were &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; or &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to&nbsp;recommend e-scooters to a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>E-scooters are replacing automobile trips.</strong>&nbsp;Thinking of their last e-scooter trip, 34 percent of Portlanders said they would have driven a personal car (19&nbsp;percent) or hailed a&nbsp;taxi, Uber or Lyft (15&nbsp;percent).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>The auto trip replacement numbers are even higher among tourists and visitors (48&nbsp;percent).</strong>&nbsp;Thinking of their last e-scooter trip, 34 percent of visitors would have taken a&nbsp;taxi, Uber or Lyft, and 14 percent would have driven a personal vehicle had e-scooters&nbsp;not&nbsp;been available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Among all respondents,&nbsp;<strong>e-scooters appear to be more popular among men (62&nbsp;percent) than women (36&nbsp;percent).&nbsp;</strong>In response to the question,&nbsp;&ldquo;What gender do you identify with?&rdquo;, 62 percent of&nbsp;respondents&nbsp;said &ldquo;man&rdquo;, and 36 respondents&nbsp;said&nbsp;&ldquo;woman&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>All respondents &ndash; Portlanders and visitors &ndash; prefer to ride e-scooters on&nbsp;the&nbsp;street,&nbsp;in the bike lane.&nbsp;</strong>Riders&rsquo; stated preference was for the bike lane over even off-street trails. Riding on sidewalks was users&rsquo; least preferred option.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>E-scooters are bringing new Portlanders to the bike lane.&nbsp;</strong>Forty-five percent of survey respondents reported &ldquo;never&rdquo; biking and 78 percent had never used BIKETOWN prior to using e-scooters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Portlanders&nbsp;are reducing or considering reducing their auto ownership due to e-scooters.</strong>&nbsp;Six percent of users report getting rid of a car because of e-scooters and another 16&nbsp;percent have considered it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""content-left"">The majority of users know the e-scooter laws, except for riding on waterfront trails.&nbsp;Users scored between&nbsp;77&nbsp;and 95&nbsp;percent correctly on all e-scooter law questions except for rules&nbsp;that prohibit riding&nbsp;in City Parks and on the waterfront trails. Only 51 percent thought riding was illegal in parks and 34 percent thought riding on waterfront trails was illegal.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">PBOT&rsquo;s evaluation of the e-scooter pilot is ongoing. Other components of the evaluation&nbsp;will&nbsp;include focus groups,&nbsp;rider behavior observations, trip data analysis,&nbsp;safety data analysis (including reported crashes),&nbsp;and analysis&nbsp;of feedback and complaints submitted through the project&rsquo;s online form.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The City is also collecting trip data from the companies. As of October 11, 2018, 472,069 trips have been taken on e-scooters in Portland, with an average trip length of 1.2 miles.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""content-left"">The evaluation period will conclude with a Findings Report released shortly after the pilot ends on November 20. Beginning November 21, shared e-scooters will not be available in Portland&nbsp;as PBOT evaluates whether they will be a long-term part&nbsp;of Portland&rsquo;s transportation system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Shared Scooters&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div class=""content-left"">
<p>Shared Electric Scooters, also known as e-scooters, are an emerging technology and shared mobility service. The first systems&nbsp;in the U.S. launched in 2017.&nbsp;Similar to bikeshare, the service provides personal transportation to rent for one-way trips. To begin a rental, companies typically require customers to download an app or text a number to unlock the device. To end a trip, customers park the scooter on the sidewalk close to the curb. The scooters are not locked to docks or stations or other objects such as bike racks or street signs.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class=""content-left"">
<p>Electric scooters are powered by an electric motor, and in Portland, companies are required to cap the maximum speed at 15 MPH.&nbsp;</p>

With the agreement in place, this much needed project will not just improve regional mobility, it will protect against displacement and gentrification. I look forward to serving on the Southwest Corridor Steering Committee to guide future project decisions, ensuring that this project meets our transportation, housing, economic and equity goals.""</p>
<p>In the past, TriMet has teamed up with&nbsp;governments and community-based&nbsp;organizations to use&nbsp;individual parcels of&nbsp;land from previous light rail projects for affordable housing, but&nbsp;the Southwest Corridor agreement is unique in looking at a comprehensive housing strategy for the entire alignment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creating more affordable housing is a region-wide priority and that urgency requires we all think creatively and aggressively about how we tackle the challenge,&rdquo; said TriMet General Manager Doug Kelsey.&nbsp;&ldquo;TriMet is dedicated to help meet the need for affordable housing in the Southwest Corridor, and we see 950 units as the floor, not the ceiling of what we and our partners can achieve together to put roofs over the heads of those in need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a City, we&rsquo;ve learned some very hard lessons about what happens when we fail to prioritize affordable housing and displacement prevention alongside our major transportation infrastructure investments,&rdquo; said Portland Housing Bureau Director Shannon Callahan. &ldquo;With this strategy, we are taking action to build from those hard lessons and ensure that the residents along the Southwest Corridor are able to share in the benefits and opportunities that come with the region&rsquo;s next light rail line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Southwest Corridor public transit improvement has been in regional plans since the 1980s, but other routes were built first.</p>
<p>The proposed route will include a connection to Marquam Hill and a shuttle to the Portland Community College Sylvania Campus. It was developed over the last seven years by Metro, TriMet, ODOT, City of Portland staff and staff from Tigard, Tualatin, Sherwood and Washington County with significant public input.</p>

<p>After local agencies and jurisdictions formalize their support for the route, the Metro Council will vote to adopt the final route into the Regional Transportation Plan. This will allow TriMet to design the project and ultimately apply for state and federal funds in support of the project.</p>
<p>As the project moves into implementation, TriMet will convene a Southwest Corridor Steering Committee made up of the jurisdictions directly affected by the project. This will likely include Cities of Portland, Tigard, and Tualatin along with Washington County, ODOT, Metro and TriMet.</p>
<p>The Steering Committee will make decisions on key items such as finalizing alignments, size and location of park-and-ride lots, station locations, and will provide direction on budget.</p>
<p>Commissioner Eudaly will represent the Portland City Council and community interests on the Steering Committee to lead the project through design and construction.</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">Creating a more reliable and efficient transportation system in Portland's Central City</h2>
<h3 class=""content-center"">Schedule Update: PBOT's Central City in Motion Plan goes to City Council on Thursday, November 15 at 2:00 p.m.</h3>
<p class=""content-left"">(Nov. 8, 2018) Between now and 2035, our Central City &ndash; already the densest concentration of people and jobs in Oregon &ndash; will continue to grow. The Central City, which stretches from the West Hills to SE 12th Avenue and from the Lloyd and Pearl districts to Powell Boulevard and South Waterfront, will add an additional 38,000 new households (a roughly 160 percent increase) and about 51,000 new jobs (a roughly 40 percent increase). The catch? All this growth will happen in 5 square miles &ndash; only three percent of the land area in Portland.</p>
<p class=""content-left""><a rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/702575?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Central City in Motion&nbsp;recommends 18 key projects</a>, building upon a robust trajectory of plans designed to create a better city: The Comprehensive Plan; Central City 2035 Plan; Transportation System Plan; NE, SW, and SE Quadrant Plans; and 2030 Bicycle Master Plan.&nbsp;Central City in Motion&nbsp;prioritizes specific transportation projects to be built over the next five years, as well as providing guidance for the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s plans over the next 10 years, recommending a total of $72 million of investments. These projects will dedicate more than nine miles of right-of-way to transit investments, create nearly 100 safer crossings for people walking and rolling, and create or improve nearly 30 miles of low-stress bikeways. Taken together, these improvements will create a more reliable transportation system, both in the Central City and throughout the region.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/11/2246938/2336809/growth_crop.png"" alt=""growth in the central city"" hspace=""7"" width=""366"" height=""264"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>Since 2012, the Portland Bureau of Transportation has been grappling with how to accommodate all&nbsp;these new Portlanders. Portland&rsquo;s iconic Central City has long been the center of innovation, from transforming a parking garage into Pioneer Courthouse Square, to the removal of SW Harbor Drive to make way for Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park. The question now is, how do we support the continued growth of our vibrant city core? After over 50 meetings, workshops and outreach events with community stakeholders and three online open houses with over 9,000 participants, a plan has taken shape that we believe will help move Portlanders to their businesses and homes efficiently, while also helping us meet crucial carbon emission reduction goals as we continue to battle the global impact of climate change. We call the plan&nbsp;Central City in Motion.</p>
<p>Planning transportation improvements in the Central City poses unique challenges and opportunities. Portland has a narrow street grid, especially in the Central City. And even with those narrow streets, public rights-of-way already account for 39 percent of the Central City&rsquo;s land area, thanks to the city&rsquo;s founders&rsquo; decision to lay out the downtown core in short, 200-foot-long blocks.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/11/2246904/2336771/1883-davidson-panorama-136-central-and-e-pdx-a2004-_crop.jpg"" alt=""Downtown Portland looking east in 1883. "" width=""590"" height=""332"" /></p>

<p>Even though our population is growing and the economy is expanding, our roadway space is not. Since we can&rsquo;t add new streets to the Central City as we grow, we will need to invest and upgrade the existing transportation system to make it more predictable, reliable and safe for residents and businesses to use other travel modes. If we don&rsquo;t take action now, it will become more difficult to travel around the Central City &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re on foot, a bike, riding a bus, or in a car or truck.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/11/2246907/2336772/street-capacity_crop.jpg"" alt=""street capacity"" width=""590"" height=""420"" /></p>
<p>Portland isn&rsquo;t the first city to face this challenge. We talked to business and transportation leaders in peer cities &ndash; Seattle, Vancouver and Calgary &ndash; all of whom have made significant investments in human powered transportation (biking, walking, rolling) and transit in their central cities in recent years because of substantial population growth in their communities. Those investments have paid off. Seattle added 60,000 jobs in its downtown core and yet 4,500 fewer people drove to work. Smart investments in their transportation network meant all the new commute trips were accommodated by transit, ridesharing, walking, and biking. Seattle&rsquo;s transit ridership is now growing faster than any other city in the country. In Vancouver, the investment in protected bike lanes downtown on two of their main streets increased the percentage of trips made by women on bike by 11 percent and, between 2007 and 2012, the average daily distance driven per resident fell by 27 percent citywide. In Calgary, the percentage of bike trips made into and out of downtown increased by 40 percent in a single year following a protected bike lane pilot. Numerous survey respondents to PBOT&rsquo;s&nbsp;Central City in Motion&nbsp;surveys provided similar feedback:&nbsp;Build protected bike lanes and I will bike downtown. Make transit faster and more reliable and I will take the bus.&nbsp;Every bike or bus trip is one less car on Portland&rsquo;s streets. With that in mind, isn&rsquo;t it everyone&rsquo;s best interest that we encourage as many people as possible to choose alternate modes of transportation? Less cars equals less traffic, more parking and cleaner air. Despite the divided times we live in today, PBOT&rsquo;s outreach suggests this is something all Portlanders can agree on.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/11/2246912/2336773/modes_crop.png"" alt=""central city modes"" hspace=""7"" width=""377"" height=""376"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>If we do nothing and all the new residents and commuters in our Central City traveled around as we do today, the result would be a 35 percent increase in the number of cars on Central City streets. Imagine thousands of additional cars attempting to jam into our already congested streets at the busiest times of day. The investments in the&nbsp;Central City in Motion&nbsp;plan are designed to avoid this future, holding traffic congestion steady for the next two decades, despite the thousands of new residents and jobs.</p>
<p>The final&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/702575?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Central City in Motion&nbsp;Implementation Plan</a>&nbsp;includes an updated prioritized project list, reflecting recent input from project stakeholders. The following projects are now included in the 1-5 year implementation schedule:Another important part of&nbsp;Central City in Motion&nbsp;is maintaining freight access, particularly in the Central Eastside Industrial District, which is home to 1,100 businesses and 17,000 jobs. Ensuring that new residents and commuters have comfortable and convenient transportation options other than driving is critical to the sustainability of the Central Eastside. Shared bus and freight priority lanes have been identified, with wide turning radii maintained in areas where businesses depend upon large trucks and delivery vehicles. In some places, streets have been redesigned to ensure that freight access is maintained while improving safety for bicyclists and pedestrians. Bus priority lanes create a more efficient transit system, helping service workers and others who travel into the Central City to access jobs and other services.</p>

<li>NW 14th&nbsp;bicycle and pedestrian crossing improvements at the request of the Pearl District</li>

It also failed to deploy at least 90 percent of the total number of e-scooters the company has permits for, in violation of the program's rules.","<p>(Nov. 13, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation has issued penalties totaling $9,000 to Skip, an e-scooter company, for violating the rules of the bureau's Shared E-Scooter Pilot Program.</p>
<p>Skip failed to provide at least 100 e-scooters a day in East Portland as required by the program. It also failed to deploy at least 90 percent of the total number of e-scooters the company has permits for, in violation of the program's rules.</p>
<p>PBOT issued a penalty of $4,500 for failing to deploy at least 100 scooters in East Portland, an area of the city that has historically been underserved by the transportation system. The City of Portland's 2035 Comprehensive Plan defines the area's geographic boundaries, which has suburban scale development, and a high proportion of immigrant communities and people living on low-incomes that are dependent on public transit service.</p>
<p>""We will hold e-scooter companies accountable for service in East Portland,"" Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said. ""E-scooter companies must show us that they can follow the rules set out by our program. It is unfair to Portlanders in East Portland for companies to fall short of reasonable public access requirements.""</p>
<p>PBOT assessed penalties of $300 a day for each of the two violations, totaling $4,500 each. The penalties stem from violations for 15 days from Oct. 17 to Oct. 31.</p>
<p>PBOT regulates e-scooter companies within the city limits. E-scooter rider conduct is governed by state law and separate city codes.</p>
<p>PBOT issued a second penalty of $4,500 to Skip for violating a requirement to have at least 90 percent of the company's fleet deployed each day during the pilot program. The requirement is designed to help Portlanders, city officials and the companies better understand the potential benefits of access to shared e-scooters.</p>
<p>Skip is allowed to have 683 e-scooters in operation in the city, one third of the total allowed. If there were no minimum number of e-scooters required to be in operation, companies could obtain a high number of permits to reduce the number of permits available to their competitors. This would also reduce the availability of the vehicles to the public and impact PBOT's ability to learn about the potential effectiveness of this emerging transportation technology.</p>
<p>PBOT will not penalize the company for days when it decided not to provide scooter service because of rainy weather.</p>
<p>Portland's e-scooter pilot program will end Nov. 20, and e-scooters will be off the streets starting Nov. 21. In early 2019, PBOT will share findings and data from the pilot program, and seek public input on next steps for e-scooter service in Portland.</p>

<p>PBOT was proactive in testing shared e-scooter technology with the public this year. The bureau announced in May that it intended to offer a pilot program in July, and sought input from the public and stakeholders in developing rules for shared e-scooter use. PBOT's rules included requirements for the companies to serve East Portland and to educate scooter riders on the rules that prohibit e-scooters in parks and on sidewalks.</p>
<p>Since the e-scooter pilot program started July 25, more than 676,000 trips have been taken, covering more than 775,000 miles. The program limited e-scooters to a total 2,049 devices offered by the three permitted companies.</p>
<p>PBOT regulates e-scooter companies within the city limits. E-scooter rider conduct is governed by state law and separate city codes.</p>

News,704627,"News Advisory: Crosswalk education and enforcement action planned for SE Holgate Blvd at SE 79 Ave on Wednesday, Nov. 28",1,,2018-11-28 17:10:57 UTC,2018-11-26 17:09:00 UTC,A,Raising awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws,"<p>(Nov. 26, 2018) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau will conduct a crosswalk safety education and enforcement action on Wednesday, Nov. 28, at the marked crossing on SE Holgate Boulevard at SE 79th Avenue from noon to 1:30 p.m. to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws. PBOT also reminds Portlanders to drive with care around libraries, schools, and other locations frequented by children and families.</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk, whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>Holgate Boulevard is one of Portland&rsquo;s 30 designated high crash network streets. This location is adjacent to Holgate Library, has bus stops on both sides of the street, and is within close proximity to Marysville Elementary School.</p>
<p>People driving can do their part by having more patience, driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Nov. 28 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to reach achieve, Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A PBOT staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>PBOT encourages everyone who uses SE Holgate Boulevard to exercise care and caution when walking, biking and driving. People driving and people walking should remain alert and people driving should watch for people in the crossing.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

This is why PBOT staff and a team of neighborhood representatives have been meeting regularly to identify potential projects and discuss the best ways to bring walking and biking facilities to Southwest.

Photo by BIKETOWN.</p>
<p>(Nov. 30, 2018) BIKETOWN members and account holders will have a chance to share their love for the bike share system with others this season through the program&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pay It Forward&rdquo; campaign. This new initiative allows users to donate credits to BIKETOWN for All &ndash; the City&rsquo;s program for discounted bike share memberships for Portlanders living on low incomes &ndash; to cover the first month of membership for BIKETOWN for All members.</p>
<p>BIKETOWN offers numerous ways for system users to earn credits on their balance by doing activities that support a well-balanced bike share system, like riding bikes parked outside of a station back to a station or by participating in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.biketownpdx.com/blog/biketown-bonus?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">BIKETOWN Bonus</a>program. Those credits can then be used to cover the cost of their rides or their monthly membership dues. After signing up, many BIKETOWN users quickly generate more positive credits on their balance than they need &ndash; leading to a surplus that could easily be reallocated to users who could use some financial support. Members can check to see if they have a positive balance by logging into their account and can fill out a&nbsp;<a href=""https://goo.gl/forms/3FvjrW05suI0lKX33?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">simple form</a>&nbsp;to indicate their desired credit donation amount. All donated credits will be used to support the BIKETOWN for All ""Pay-it-Forward"" program.</p>
<p>A BIKETOWN for All membership costs $3 per month and includes 90 minutes of daily riding time. The goal of the Pay-It-Forward initiative is to gather enough credits to make the first month free for every BIKETOWN for All member and eliminate a potential hurdle to membership. BIKETOWN for All members will never pay additional fees for going over time limit or parking out of the service area. Individuals who are Oregon Trail Card holders, live in affordable housing, and/or receive other social services can sign up for a BIKETOWN for All membership online at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.biketownforall.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.biketownforall.com</a>.</p>
<p>There are currently 440 BIKETOWN for All members. The top BIKETOWN rider is a BIKETOWN for All member with a total of 2,200 trips made since the beginning of the program. Of the top ten BIKETOWN users across the bike share system, seven are BIKETOWN for All members. Annual BIKETOWN members, on average, have at least five credits on their account at any given time.</p>
<p>All new BIKETOWN for all Members will receive the $3 Pay-it-Forward credit and, as part of their membership, agree that when they generate enough credit to pay for their next 6 months, $3 will be donated from their account back into the Pay-it-Forward program. The &ldquo;Pay it Forward&rdquo; opportunity will be available for general BIKETOWN members this season, to give all BIKETOWN members, not just BIKETOWN for All members, an opportunity to contribute and support the program.</p>

<p>(Dec. 14, 2018) Anyone who has traveled on 122nd Avenue will tell you that&nbsp;it can make getting from place to place difficult and stressful. Most of the street is five lanes. The on-street parking and narrow bike lanes drop off to become turn lanes at the street&rsquo;s major intersection. The sidewalks are often narrow and substandard. Most of the crosswalks need to be updated.&nbsp;Buses can be slow, delayed in traffic and late. In short, it&rsquo;s time to fix 122nd Avenue.</p>
<p><br />The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is developing a plan to make 122nd Avenue better. With the help of the public, PBOT is identifying projects to be built in 2020. Potential changes include safety improvements, more lighting, crossings, improved bike lanes, bus lanes, signal changes and more to help&nbsp;meet our safety and accessibility goals. A portion of the funding for 122nd Avenue comes from Fixing Our Streets, which will provide $2M for the design and construction of safety and access improvements focused on the following goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase safety for all, improve pedestrian &amp; bicycle access and support better transit while balancing needs of freight &amp; other modes.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Identify improvements to help eliminate serious injuries and fatalities and remove 122nd&nbsp;Ave from the High Crash Corridor network.&nbsp;</li>

News,707010,"PBOT Travel Advisory: Heavy rains Monday night through Tuesday may lead to road hazards, street flooding",1,,2018-12-18 01:00:54 UTC,2018-12-18 00:48:00 UTC,A,,"<p><a href=""/transportation/article/550821""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=707011"" alt=""Get Home Safe logo for Stormy Weather"" width=""684"" height=""260"" /></a></p>
<p>(Dec. 17, 2018) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) warns the traveling public to be prepared for heavy rain that could create hazardous traveling conditions tonight and Tuesday. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a wind advisory for the Portland area from 6 p.m. Monday through 8 a.m. Tuesday with southerly 25 to 40 mph wind with gusts up to 45 mph. Higher gusts up to 55 mph are likely for exposed terrain such as the West Hills and Mount Scott. In addition, NWS has issued a flood watch from late Monday night into Wednesday afternoon, with 1.5 to 3 inches of rain expected in the Portland area.</p>
<p>The heaviest rain is expected Tuesday morning between 4 and 10 a.m., when up to 1 inch could fall in a two-hour period, enough to cause significant urban flooding.</p>
<p>PBOT asks the traveling public, residents and businesses to take steps to reduce hazards associated with these conditions.&nbsp;The best way to prevent streets from flooding is for everyone to help keep Portland's 58,000 storm drains clear before a storm arrives. Use a rake, shovel or broom and clear by standing in the sidewalk, not the street. Be aware of passing vehicles and check the drain again during and after a storm.&nbsp;It's also a good idea to clear inlets that lead stormwater to the green street planters in city streets.&nbsp;See more tips at&nbsp;<a href=""/stormdrains?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.portlandoregon.gov/stormdrains</a>.</p>
<p>Heavy rain over a short period of time, in the range of 1 inch of rain in three-to-six hours, could overwhelm the city&rsquo;s stormwater system and cause flooding, even in areas with clear storm drains. The Weather Service has compared the coming rainstorms to the events of Halloween 2015 and December 2015, when widespread urban flooding occurred in Portland. Heavy rain also can also vary significantly from one neighborhood to another within the city, so expect varying conditions throughout the city and the metropolitan area.</p>
<p>For weeks, PBOT's street sweeping and Leaf Day service have cleared leaves and other debris in preparation for fall and winter rainstorms. On Monday, PBOT crews cleared large storm drains in the West Hills that have a history of flooding and restocked sandbag three locations available to the public. PBOT will have extra crews working overnight and before dawn Tuesday, available to clear clogged storm drains, and to place road-closed barricades.</p>
<p>All travelers should be alert, regardless of how they are moving throughout the city:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When driving,&nbsp;go slowly.</strong>&nbsp;Use extra care and look for people walking or biking.&nbsp;Adjust your speed to the road conditions and leave yourself plenty of room to stop.&nbsp;If a storm knocks out power to traffic signals, treat intersections like an all-way stop and proceed with caution. The driver who stops first has the right of way to go first.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Do not drive through standing water or around barricades</strong>&nbsp;on flooded streets. Turn around safely. The wake from your vehicle can cause public and private property damage and flood houses and businesses. Barricades sometimes mark hazards that are not visible in the immediate area, but may be located hundreds of feet away, in order to direct traffic to alternate routes. Areas with standing water could have displaced manhole covers, leaving a 3-foot wide manhole uncovered and exposed, creating a hazard for anyone traveling in the area.</li>
<li><strong>When biking,</strong>&nbsp;allow plenty of stopping distance and avoid road surfaces that are steel, painted or covered in leaves or water. Remember that puddles can disguise potholes.</li>
<li><strong>When walking,&nbsp;</strong>always cross at a crosswalk or at the corner. Look for oncoming vehicles before stepping down from the sidewalk and crossing the street. If possible, establish eye contact with drivers and continue looking left-right-left while crossing. Remember that oncoming vehicles may approach more quickly than anticipated and may have difficulty stopping at an intersection in rainy conditions.</li>

Bank full is 10 feet; flood stage is 11 feet. Because of BES restoration in the Foster Floodplain Natural Area, the risk to the Lents area is reduced and it takes about 13 feet for that area to be affected. But other areas along the creek may still experience flooding at 11 feet.</p>
<p>The last observed level was about 1.89 feet (12:30 p.m. on Dec. 17), and it is predicted to reach 11.33 feet by 10 a.m. Tuesday, Dec. 18. So, there is a possibility that Johnson Creek may have minor flooding, which could affect buildings and roads.</p>
<p>To help residents and business owners prepare for a flood emergency,&nbsp;sand and sandbags are available at no charge to anyone who wants to use them to protect their property from flood damage. PBOT crews confirmed Monday that the sites are stocked with sand and sand bags. No shovels are provided, so the public must bring their own.&nbsp;Locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SE&nbsp;88th Avenue just south of&nbsp;SE Holgate Boulevard in the parking lot at Lents Park. Enter parking&nbsp;lot at the bottom of the hill, and follow one-way traffic to the sand pile at the exit on the eastside of SE 88th Avenue;</li>
<li>SE 111th Avenue and Harold Street at the southeast corner of the intersection; and</li>
<li>SW 42nd&nbsp;Avenue and&nbsp;Vermont Street in&nbsp;the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park; enter Gabriel Park from Vermont.</li>
</ul>
<p>If travelers encounter downed utility wires or power lines in the Portland area, they should call 911. Never touch a downed power line. In fact, do not even get close. Even if a power line is not sparking, it could still be energized. Remember that water and electricity do not mix. Never try to free lines or to remove tree limbs from lines by yourself.</p>
<p>In addition, to report power outages or downed lines, contact&nbsp;PGE at 503-464-7777 or Pacific Power at&nbsp;877-508-5088. To report traffic signals out, call PBOT's&nbsp;24/7 dispatch hotline&nbsp;at 503-823-1700. Please dial 911 for emergencies only.</p>

<p>(Dec. 21, 2018) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau will conduct a crosswalk safety education and enforcement action on Wednesday, Dec. 26, at the marked crossing on West Burnside Street at Northwest 20th&nbsp;Place from noon to 1:30 p.m. to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws. PBOT also reminds Portlanders to watch for people walking at all hours of the day or night and encourages people to think about how they plan to get home before they leave to attend a New Year&rsquo;s Eve party or other holiday event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk, whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>The crossing on West Burnside Street at NW 20th&nbsp;Place has marked crosswalks and signage but no signals or flashing beacons.&nbsp; The intersection is scheduled to have a full traffic signal installed in the future and has an anticipated installation date of 2021.</p>
<p>This intersection is the 11th worst intersection for pedestrians on the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/657846?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Vision Zero High Crash Intersection List</a>&nbsp;that examines intersections with the highest numbers of reported collisions for people walking and biking in the five&#8208;year period from January 2012 through December 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crash data from 2007 through 2016 indicate 14 crashes occurred at this intersection with 10 of the crashes involving people walking (7 moderate injuries, 3 minor injuries).</p>
<p>East and West Burnside is a&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/59277?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">high crash network street</a>, where a total of 85 fatal and serious injury crashes occurred in 2007-16, the most recent 10-year period for which data are available.</p>
<p>People driving can do their part by having more patience, driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Dec. 26 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to achieve, Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws.

News,707844,News Blog: Moving to Portland in the new year? PBOT's here to help you find your way,1,,2018-12-26 22:40:43 UTC,2018-12-26 22:28:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Dec. 27, 2018) Do you know someone moving to Portland in the new year? Make sure they know about the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT)&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/43801?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">SmartTrips program</a>, which helps Portlanders find their way around the city by&nbsp;walking, biking and taking transit to get where they want to go.</p>
<p>Entering its 15th year, SmartTrips is a PBOT program aimed at new movers with the goal of encouraging people to walk, bike or take transit either for their commute or for those shorter trips to take care of daily needs &ndash; such as a trip to the grocery store or neighborhood coffee shop.&nbsp;Getting more Portlanders to rethink how they use the automobile and consider the benefits of active transportation not only reduces some of the pressures on our transportation system, it can help lead to a healthier Portland as well.</p>
<p>With nearly 140,000 new households expected in our city in the next 25 years, growing traffic congestion and increased demands on our transportation system will continue to be a frustrating fact of life. While the region will continue to invest in a transportation system to help Portlanders get to where they need to go, it will take all of us working together to create a better Portland.</p>
<p>Portland was the first&nbsp;North American city&nbsp;to pilot the concept of using individualized marketing to get people to bike, walk, and take transit. Used extensively in the public health field, individualized social marketing is an approach that aims to change people&rsquo;s behavior for the benefit of individuals and society as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does SmartTrips work? Using direct mail, recent Portland movers receive newsletters about transportation options and an invitation to order incentives, maps and information about walking, biking and transit options in their new neighborhood. Participants get to choose what information they find to be most useful to them.</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2018/12/2321746/2425672/st-order-form-2018-x4a-0216-page-1_crop.png"" alt=""Smart Trips order form"" width=""540"" height=""596"" /></p>
<p><br />SmartTrips served nearly 50,000 new mover households in 2018, up from nearly 40,000 households in 2017. Ten percent of our new mover households chose to take up our offer and order customized packets of materials that PBOT delivers by bike right to their doorstep. Like the welcome wagon of old, bicycle delivery is both cost effective given the volume of orders, while also allowing our staff to interact with program participants in-person and provide a human touch. In 2018, PBOT staff members biked a combined total of approximately 4,300 miles to deliver&nbsp;more than 5,000 custom-packed orders. No wonder that they are experts in the best ways to navigate the city by bicycle.The 2018 SmartTrips order form for new movers in Portland.</p>
<p>Does SmartTrips work? Surveys show that our new mover participants specifically are taking active trips to work six percent more since moving to their new address and experiencing the program, and they are using active modes for neighborhood trips 18 percent more. Portland is one of a few cities that offer this service to new movers and do it almost year-round (February to December). Thanks to the generous support of Metro, we are looking forward to welcoming another batch of new movers to Portland in 2019 and showing them all the great ways to travel around our wonderful city.</p>

<p><strong>WHERE:&nbsp;</strong>Between the Steel Bridge and Hawthorne Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN:&nbsp;</strong>Work begins February 1 with the trail reopening on April 1, 2019.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eastbank Esplanade is treasured by Portlanders for both commuting and recreation,&rdquo; says Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;This long-planned project will improve safety and park amenities, replace invasive vegetation with native species, and restore our public art. I want to thank our partners at BES, PBOT, and RACC for working together on this important project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Project work will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R replacing degraded surfaces and amenities</li>

<p>This is the third year of the Council-approved, 5-year implementation of Better Naito. Like past years, PBOT will install plastic posts to separate one northbound motor vehicle lane on Naito Parkway between SW Main Street and NW Couch Street. There will also be a designated passenger drop off zone on SW Taylor Street to better accommodate people being dropped off by personal vehicles, taxis, and rideshares.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has placed signage noticing the upcoming closure on and near the affected portion of the Esplanade. The City will continue public involvement notifications and updates on the Eastbank Esplanade maintenance project throughout the closure. Thank you to all neighbors and visitors for their patience while we repair this well-used Portland pathway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Naito is once again proving its worth, this time&nbsp;as a safe and convenient alternate route for the thousands of people who walk and bike along the Eastbank Esplanade every day,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;It is also an important first step in the implementation of&nbsp;projects within the Central City in Motion Plan approved by City Council in November. Community members have requested&nbsp;quick implementation of the projects within the plan, and we are listening. I look forward to more progress in 2019, 2020 and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Background: Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade Maintenance Project</strong></h2>
<p>The Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade is one of Portland&rsquo;s iconic sites and pathways, both a beloved City park and a major bicycle and pedestrian thoroughfare running approximately 1.5 miles along the east bank of the Willamette River from the Hawthorne Bridge to the Steel Bridge. The City&rsquo;s 2018-19 Adopted Budget includes $500,000 in one-time General Fund resources, plus $200,000 in ongoing funding for maintenance, to begin addressing the issues on the Esplanade and making safety and functional improvements.</p>
<p>According to PBOT, during summer months the Eastbank Esplanade sees approximately 2,400 daily bicycle trips (almost 500 during the two-hour peak) and approximately 1,200 daily walking trips. The SW Naito Corridor (including the Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park path) is one of Portland&rsquo;s busiest bikeway corridors. In the summer of 2018 it attracted approximately 5,200 daily bicycle trips.</p>
<p>The Esplanade was named after Mayor Vera Katz in November 2004 to honor her vision and leadership for Portland - which included support for the construction of the esplanade. Along with the iconic bronze statue of Mayor Katz located just north of the Hawthorne Bridge, five other significant works of public art populate the esplanade as it makes its way to the Burnside Bridge.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the Jan. 23 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to achieve, Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A Portland Bureau of Transportation staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking.

News,711268,News Blog: New bridges in the new year,1,,2019-01-31 23:44:51 UTC,2019-01-29 23:37:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Jan. 29, 2019) Bridgetown. That&rsquo;s our city. In fact, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) already manages 152 different bridges across the city &ndash; many of which are 75 to 100 years old, or older! As our city grows, PBOT is actively working to build new bridges or update old ones to better serve people walking, biking and driving. In 2019, the bureau will open one rebuilt bridge and begin construction on two new, highly anticipated bridges with a fourth bridge on the horizon. All of these will help connect neighborhoods and make it easier to get around Portland.</p>
<h2>SE 122nd Avenue Bridge</h2>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/01/2369493/2477928/1-8-19_crop.jpg"" alt=""The SE 122nd Avenue bridge under construction over Johnson Creek.

<p class=""gd_caption""><em>The SE 122nd Avenue Bridge over Johnson Creek during construction in January 2019. Photo by Cameron Glasgow, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>In December 2015, a severe record-breaking storm damaged the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/70427?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SE 122nd Avenue Bridge</a>&nbsp;over Johnson Creek. Damage to the 57-year-old timber bridge was so extensive, it required a complete replacement. A new steel plate girder bridge will span the entire width of the creek to lower the risk of future storm damage. This new bridge will feature ADA-compliant sidewalks and safe access for pedestrians on both sides of the bridge. The bridge was also designed to blend into the natural beauty of the area, with leaves of grass decorating the railings.</p>
<p>PBOT is nearing completion and expects to open the bridge in early March 2019. The bureau thanks all nearby residents and businesses for their patience during the closure of this important crossing.</p>
<h2>Sullivan's Crossing</h2>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/01/2369498/2477929/bridge-illustration_crop.jpg"" alt=""Sullivan's Crossing rendering"" width=""590"" height=""371"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_caption""><em>An illustration of the future Sullivan's Crossing pedestrian and bicycle bridge over I-84.</em></p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/71338?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing</a>&nbsp;is a walking and biking bridge that will provide a vital connection over Interstate 84 between the Central Eastside and Lloyd districts at NE Seventh Avenue. Design work is nearly complete and PBOT has contracted with Oregon-based HP Civil to oversee construction. HP Civil has extensive experience in bridge construction. A final contract will head to City Council for approval in June. PBOT expects the 18-month project to break ground August 2019 and open to the public in early 2021.</p>
<h2>Rivergate Overcrossing&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/01/2369511/2477930/rivergate-1_crop.jpg"" alt=""Rivergate Overcrossing"" width=""590"" height=""293"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_caption""><em>An illustration of the future Rivergate Overcrossing in North Portland.</em></p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/rivergate?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Rivergate Overcrossing</a>&nbsp;is a new bridge over rail tracks on N Rivergate Boulevard. This new connection will provide access to several large businesses including Evraz Oregon Steel Mills. This $26 million bridge is funded through a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant awarded to the Port of Portland in 2016 by the Federal Highway Administration.</p>
<p>PBOT is completing final designs and expects the project to begin construction in June 2019. The new Rivergate Overcrossing should be completed December 2020.</p>
<h2>Flanders Crossing</h2>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/01/2369516/2477931/illustrative_crop.jpg"" alt=""Flanders Crossing rendering"" width=""590"" height=""333"" /></p>
<p class=""gd_caption""><em>An illustration of the future Flanders Crossing over I-405 in NW Portland.</em></p>
<p>Although construction will not begin in 2019, stay tuned for updates on&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71475?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Flanders Crossing</a>, a new walking and biking bridge that will connect NW Flanders over Interstate 405. Flanders Crossing will provide the residents of the Northwest and Pearl districts a more direct, safe crossing over I&#8208;405. The new bridge will also provide a seismic-resilient route for emergency vehicles in the event of an earthquake.</p>
<p>In 2007, the city first identified NW Flanders Street (and its crossing over I-405) as a vital route with huge potential for walking and biking. Flanders Crossing was finally approved by City Council in 2017. Design is nearly complete. Construction should begin in late 2019 or early 2020.</p>

There will also be a new day and time: Fridays at 11:30 a.m. Meetings will take place about every other month.</p>
<p>The PBOT Bike Lunch and Learn began in 2007 as a response to the huge interest in Portland&rsquo;s 2006 Bike Summit, hosted by PBOT and PSU. The Lunch and Learn offered topics of interest to bicycle advocates, city staff and the general public. The popularity of the program over the years led to the bureau deciding to widen the range of topics covered and seek out a new space to accommodate the growing number of attendees.</p>

News,711677,"Travel Advisory: National Weather Service warns of potential winter weather for Monday evening commute, icy Tuesday morning commute",1,,2019-02-05 22:55:01 UTC,2019-02-04 22:51:00 UTC,A,"It’s time to get Winter Ready, PDX!","<p>(Feb. 4, 2019) The National Weather Service has notified the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) of the potential for accumulating snow of up to 1 inch to create slick road conditions for this evening's rush hour commute, from 4 to 7 p.m. The Service also advises the public to expect freezing temperatures to produce black ice Monday night, lasting into Tuesday morning commute hours.</p>
<p>PBOT advises the public to be aware of forecasts, use caution, delay your travel to avoid traveling during forecast snow or ice. Consider public transit, and check&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://trimet.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#alerts/"" target=""_blank"">trimet.org/alerts</a>and&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">portlandstreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for service alerts before you go.</p>
<p>Temperatures are expected to freeze overnight on Tuesday night as well, potentially freezing any moisture on the roads at that time. Monday night may reach a low of 28 degrees in Portland, with wet streets that may freeze. Tuesday night lows may reach 20 to 25 degrees, but with less moisture on area roadways, so less chance of icy conditions on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>In icy conditions, PBOT strongly advises delaying travel if possible. If people must travel, PBOT recommends taking public transit.</p>
<p>PBOT also reminds property owners, tenants and businesses that they are responsible for clearing sidewalks of snow and ice. It is important that sidewalks are clear so that people who are walking to transit and people with disabilities can move about safely.</p>
<p>While the forecast is still unclear, there are some simple things all Portlanders can do to prepare themselves for winter weather.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make a checklist for your home, business, and/or vehicle.</strong>&nbsp;Property owners, tenants and businesses should have supplies on hand, such as ice melt and snow shovels to clear sidewalks as well as pathways across their driveways. People driving should carry snow chains and an emergency kit.</li>
<li><strong>Create an emergency plan&nbsp;</strong>with your family or work colleagues that emphasizes telecommuting, public transit and emergency meeting locations for your Monday morning commute. Check our&nbsp;<a href=""/winter?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Winter Weather Center</a>&nbsp;to see the priority snow and ice routes nearest you.</li>
<li><strong>Know your elevation, and the elevation of areas you are traveling to and through.&nbsp;</strong>Check the interactive elevation map in the ""Elevation, Weather and Traffic"" section of&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/winter?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">PBOT&rsquo;s Winter Weather Center</a>&nbsp;to see if your area is located at 500 feet or 1,000 above sea level.

<p><strong>Never abandon your vehicle in a travel lane.&nbsp;</strong>If you choose to drive and your vehicle loses traction, pull over into a shoulder or legal parking space. You can call for a tow truck and remain with your vehicle. Or you can leave your vehicle legally parked and walk carefully to a public transit stop or other safe place. Any vehicle creating a safety hazard is subject to citation, tow and impound. The cost of a citation and tow for abandoned vehicles preventing free passage (blocking a travel lane) is $201. Additional costs to store a towed vehicle longer than four hours is $27 per day.</p>

<p>(Feb. 5, 2019)&nbsp;Portland's largest Fixing Our Streets project is focused on pavement rehabilitation on&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/Transportation/136th?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">SE 136th Avenue</a>&nbsp;between SE Division Street and SE Foster Road. This project combines $4 million of investments from Fixing Our Streets to repave SE 136th Avenue and is leveraging an additional $2.7 million of Transportation System Development Charges (TSDCs) to build new sidewalks and curb ramps along the corridor. The project will also include over 50 new street trees, stormwater and street lighting improvements, and new crosswalks to improve access to two transit lines serving SE 136th Avenue.</p>
<p>PBOT is also providing opportunities for residents to help shape the future of this street.&nbsp; Residents will have the opportunity to have trees planted on their property and to provide input on the type of trees that are planted. We encourage property owners on the west side of SE 136th Avenue to tell us more about their frontage using our&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEHZhjx36JKbBG6F1OhojqNT3wXmCU1hJ7seUj76vaw5DWaw/viewform?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">online form.</a></p>
<p>SE 136th Avenue is a primary Safe Routes to School route and a major city bikeway.&nbsp;The biking and walking enhancements on SE 136th Avenue will help connect families to new bicycle infrastructure on SE Division Street and SE Powell Boulevard.&nbsp;Children will be able to walk more safely to Gilbert Park and Gilbert Heights elementary schools located nearby SE 136th Avenue.</p>

<p><strong>SHELTER</strong></p>
<p>Forecasts showing significant snow accumulation, as well as sub-freezing temperatures, mean&nbsp;severe weather shelters will again reopen in Multnomah County on Friday night, Feb. 8.</p>
<p>Severe weather shelters do not require identification or any other documentation.</p>
<p>No one seeking shelter during severe weather will be turned away &mdash; and more sites will open as needed. The Joint Office&nbsp;will continue to monitor forecasts and escalate the response to weather conditions as needed over the coming days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to<a href=""http://211info.org/""> 211info.org</a>&nbsp;or call 211 for the latest information on which shelters are open, and when, and to coordinate transport for anyone who needs shelter but does not have a way to get there. Families with children should contact 211 directly to access and arrange transport as needed to severe weather shelters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DONATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Urgently, service providers and the Joint Office are continuing their call for<a href=""https://multco.us/winter-weather/winter-donations-and-shelter-volunteers"">&nbsp;community donations of life-saving winter gear</a>&nbsp;&mdash; particularly before this evening, when snow is expected to begin accumulating.</p>
<p>Because this season was mild up to this point, service providers say they haven&rsquo;t been receiving their usual amount of donated supplies, which help outreach workers keep people warm and dry night after night.</p>
<p>Please visit<a href=""http://211info.org/donations/"">&nbsp;211info.org/donations</a>&nbsp;to see a specific list of winter gear and where it can be dropped off. Providers also have<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/LEO6FL87NNHE"">&nbsp;an online shopping list</a>&nbsp;to make donating more convenient, which means anyone can donate over the weekend, even if snow and ice have made roads difficult to traverse.&nbsp;Items ordered online can be delivered directly to JOIN,&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/1435+NE+81st+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97213/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495a1146be628d5:0x6c76a7e6fde06c1b?ved=2ahUKEwiloYq_kKrgAhWn5lQKHbMbBPMQ8gEwAHoECAAQAQ"">1435 NE 81st Ave.</a>, Suite 100, Portland, OR, 97213.</p>

<p><strong>CURBSIDE COLLECTION OF GARBAGE, RECYCLING AND COMPOST ROLL CARTS</strong></p>
<p>During severe winter weather, the collection of garbage, recycling and compost roll carts may be postponed for Portland's single-family homes and smallplexes up to 4 units. Portland's franchised garbage and recycling companies will prioritize curbside collection in the following order: 1) garbage, 2) recycling, 3) compost. &nbsp;If there's snow or ice accumulation on collection day, please leave roll carts at the curb&mdash;your carts will be emptied when it is safe to do so. Garbage and recycling companies will make every effort to empty roll carts before the customer's next scheduled collection day.

<p><strong>PORTLAND BUREAU OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Emergency Management (PBEM) is currently in &ldquo;enhanced operations&rdquo; and is actively monitoring the weather situation. PBEM is ready to activate Portland&rsquo;s Emergency Coordination Center this weekend if necessary to support the weather response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUREAU OF EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Emergency Communications is encouraging the public to call 911 if they see anyone unsheltered whose life appears to be in danger, is in an apparent medical crisis, or does not seem dressed for the weather conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUREAU OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES</strong></p>
<p>Environmental Services operates the City of Portland&rsquo;s Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant 24/7&nbsp;year-round, regardless of weather. Staff are gearing up to manage additional volumes when the snow comes, and especially when it melts, and gets funneled through the City&rsquo;s combined sewer and stormwater pipes for treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WATER BUREAU</strong></p>
<p>Portland Water crews are on standby to respond to water mains that can burst in cold weather. If you see water running from streets or sidewalks, please call our 24-hour Emergency Line at 503-823-4874. It&rsquo;s also important that you take steps to protect your home plumbing from the freezing temperatures. Get information on how to safeguard your home plumbing and what to do if pipes freeze by visiting the Portland Water winter prep website at <a href=""/water/winterprep"">www.portlandoregon.gov/water/winterprep</a>.</p>
<p>The cold weather has prompted the City to turn off the Benson Bubbler drinking fountains due to the cold and wind. When the two elements combine, they can create a hazardous icy patch around the bubblers. Three Bubblers will be left on for use by those depending on them as a drinking water source. A list of the active Bubblers is available at the website <a href=""/water/bensonbubblers"">www.portlandoregon.gov/water/bensonbubblers</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PORTLAND BUREAU OF TRANSPORTATION</strong></p>
<p>PBOT's Maintenance Operations has&#8239;gone into Incident Command System (ICS) mode. We are treating all anti-icing routes. We are watching the forecast and will adjust our response accordingly, including plowing and salting city streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT advises the public to be aware of forecasts, use caution, delay your travel to avoid traveling during forecast snow or ice.

<p>Property owners, tenants, and businesses are responsible for clearing sidewalks of snow and ice. It is important that sidewalks are clear so that people who are walking to transit and people with disabilities can move about safely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In icy conditions, PBOT strongly advises delaying travel if possible. If people must travel, PBOT recommends taking public transit.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Make a checklist for your home, business, and/or vehicle.</strong>&nbsp;Property owners, tenants, and businesses should have supplies on hand such as ice melt and snow shovels to clear sidewalks as well as pathways across their driveways. People driving should carry snow chains and an emergency kit.&nbsp;</li>

<p>PBOT works to keep vital transit lines and emergency routes open in winter weather. These priority snow and ice routes are the most critical for our city&rsquo;s police and fire stations, hospitals, schools, frequent bus routes, the downtown core, and major business districts -- about a third of our entire street grid. PBOT&rsquo;s mission is to provide at least one passable lane in each direction on these priority routes so that vehicles with front-wheel drive or traction devices can get through. In a major snowfall, it can take our crews up to 12 hours to cover these priority routes once.&#8239;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give PBOT crews time and space to do their work in winter weather. Our crews drive equipment in low visibility and extreme weather. DO NOT cut in front of them or try and pass them at any time. Even if they are going slow, you will find the road much clearer and safer behind a snowplow than in front!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume you know what their job is. Our crews perform multiple jobs with their trucks, not just plowing.

<p><strong>FIRE &amp; RESCUE</strong></p>
<p>Portland Fire &amp; Rescue&rsquo;s Emergency Operations Division is ready to respond to emergencies with the expectation that road conditions will be hazardous. Fire engines and trucks are equipped with traction devices and will be constantly monitoring road conditions in their response areas. Firefighters are also being asked to monitor their response areas for individuals vulnerable to the expected severe weather and coordinate transport for those individuals to a shelter. PF&amp;R will also have community outreach teams who are ready to respond help with finding these vulnerable individuals and will be used at the discretion of the Bureau of Emergency management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are asking the public to join us. If you see people out on the streets or in a park or anywhere that needs help let us know use the non-emergency line, use 211, use 911. If they look like they are not prepared for the coming weather let us know. If the threat looks immediate, call 911. This could be a matter of life or death.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_p"">(Feb. 11, 2019) The National Weather Service has notified the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) of the potential for accumulating snow of a trace or up to 2 inches at low elevation areas, beginning after midnight tonight through 5 a.m. Tuesday morning. Areas at 500 feet or higher have the highest chance of snow and could have greater accumulation. Conditions will likely vary across the city.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">If conditions do not produce snow, they could instead generate heavy rainfall that produces street flooding and potentially impacting the Johnson Creek area near Foster Road in Southeast Portland.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">More winter weather, with the possibility of additional snow accumulation, is expected later this week.</p>

<p>There is potential for flooding near Johnson Creek to impact travel on Johnson Creek Blvd. and Foster Road overnight tonight through Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The City of Portland continues to monitor the forecast and flood gauges. While we expect minor street flooding because of heavy rain in the area, we do not expect streets to be flooded by the creek. Flooding could affect some low-lying areas along the creek where homeless individuals camp and some private properties in the area.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Sycamore Gauge on Johnson Creek near 152nd Avenue and Foster Road reached 5.5 feet, as of about noon today. When the guage reaches 11 feet it is considered flood stage, when the creek overtops its banks in some places.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">As of Monday afternoon, the gauge is forecast to reach anywhere from 10 feet to more than 11 feet on Tuesday morning, and recede quickly. The flooding threat is expected to be reduced within a few hours. Monitor the website for the guage for the latest forecast:&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?gage=SYCO3&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;view=1%2C0%2C1%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C1%2C0&amp;wfo=PQR"" target=""_blank"">Bit.ly/JCreekgauge</a></p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The bureaus of Transportation (PBOT), Parks &amp; Recreation, Emergency Management (PBEM), Environmental Services (BES) and the Portland-Multnomah County Joint Office on Homelessness are working together, with support from 211info, to warn residents, businesses and property owners along Johnson Creek that of the potential for flooding overnight.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Today, as a precaution, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation park rangers joined area social service providers to do outreach. Rangers and social service staff contacted people experiencing homelessness - near areas along Johnson Creek that are likely to flood &ndash; and issued warnings about the potential dangers of tonight&rsquo;s rain and possible flooding.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">The Joint Office of Homeless Services is working with shelter providers to identify available shelter beds for individuals displaced due to the flooding. Individuals seeking additional information about the flooding risk and available shelter should call 211info. (Dial 2-1-1 or visit the website,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.211info.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">www.211info.org</a>.)</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""content-center"">Sandbag locations are stocked and ready</h1>
<p class=""gd_p content-left"">To help residents and business owners prepare for a flood emergency,&nbsp;sand and sandbags are available at no charge to anyone who wants to use them to protect their property from flood damage. PBOT crews keep the sites stocked with sand and sand bags. No shovels are provided, so the public must bring their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">Sandbag locations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SE&nbsp;88th Avenue just south of&nbsp;Holgate Boulevard in the parking lot at Lents Park. Enter parking&nbsp;lot at the bottom of the hill, and follow one-way traffic to the sand pile at the exit on the east side of SE 88th;</li>
<li>SE 111th Avenue and Harold Street at the southeast corner of the intersection; and</li>
<li>SW 42nd&nbsp;Avenue and&nbsp;Vermont Street in&nbsp;the lower parking lot of Gabriel Park; enter Gabriel Park from Vermont.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""gd_p"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">In the event that streets are closed, PBOT asks the traveling public to obey all road closed signs. Do not move them or drive around them. The roads have been closed because of hazardous conditions. If drivers ignore the signs, they are potentially putting themselves, other travelers and PBOT crews at risk.</p>
<p class=""gd_p"">To report downed trees or street flooding that are causing a hazard and covering a travel lane, call PBOT's maintenance dispatch at 503-823-1700.</p>

<p>(Feb. 21, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) Interim Director Chris Warner, along with members of the Gateway Regional Center community, gathered today to celebrate the start of an area-wide series of transportation projects that will transform the neighborhood in the coming year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can already see progress on NE Halsey Boulevard and NE Weidler Street, where the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/77731?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project</a>&nbsp;is underway. This project focuses on providing safer crossings and a more comfortable experience for pedestrians at key intersections throughout the business corridor. This is done by extending the curb, marking new crosswalks, adding rapid flashing beacons, and providing better lighting. This project also upgrades the experience of people biking along Halsey and Weidler, adding new parking-protected bike lanes that are separated from vehicle travel lanes. It will also provide more on-street parking.</p>
<p>The Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project is bookended by special features that will create opportunities in the neighborhood for community placemaking. The first of these features is a &ldquo;festival street&rdquo; on NE 103rd Avenue between NE Halsey and Clackamas streets. The second is a public plaza in the area known as the East Entry Triangle, bordered by NE 112th Avenue, Halsey and Weidler. Further enhancements include new streetlights with their own unique design, as well as wider sidewalk space to allow for more trash cans, benches, bicycle racks, and other street furniture.</p>

<p>The $5.5 million streetscape project is funded by PBOT&rsquo;s Fixing Our Streets program, Prosper Portland, Transportation System Development Charges, and the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services&rsquo; &ldquo;% for Green&rdquo; program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re at the beginning of some major transportation transformations in the Gateway area and there is a lot to look forward to,&rdquo; said PBOT Interim Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;The improvements coming to the neighborhood will make it easier for everyone to safely walk, bike, drive and take transit to local businesses, parks and schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new streetscape is yet another win for East Portland and Gateway,&rdquo; said Nidal Kahl, President of the Gateway Area Business Association. &ldquo;After 5 years of collaboration between community and business leaders with all the city bureaus, Gateway takes another giant leap towards growth, positioned for economic development that drives Portland's reputation for unique, local eco-friendly enterprises. This new investment from the city and Prosper Portland will improve livability and help us welcome new neighbors and new business with a visual message of improvement in the oldest and largest business district in Oregon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Feb. 24, 2019) The National Weather Service has notified the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) of the potential for accumulating snow of up to 2 inches across the city, including downtown, beginning late Sunday night and continuing into Monday morning commute hours. Temperatures may remain low for much of the day Monday, so snow that accumulates in the morning may linger throughout the day. There may be more accumulations in areas at 500 feet or higher above sea level, so everyone should check the elevation at your home, your destination and areas along your route.</p>
<p>There is also a potential for refreezing on Monday night that could affect Tuesday morning's commute hours.</p>
<p>PBOT advises the public to be aware of forecasts, use caution, delay your travel to avoid traveling during forecast snow or ice. Consider public transit, and check&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://trimet.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#alerts/"" target=""_blank"">trimet.org/alerts</a>and&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">portlandstreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for service alerts before you go.</p>
<p>PBOT also reminds property owners, tenants and businesses that they are responsible for clearing sidewalks of snow and ice. It is important that sidewalks are clear so that people who are walking to transit and people with disabilities can move about safely.</p>
<p>In snowy and icy conditions, PBOT strongly advises delaying travel if possible. If people must travel, PBOT recommends taking public transit.</p>
<p>While the forecast is still unclear, there are some simple things all Portlanders can do to prepare themselves for winter weather.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make a checklist for your home, business, and/or vehicle.</strong>&nbsp;Property owners, tenants and businesses should have supplies on hand, such as ice melt and snow shovels to clear sidewalks as well as pathways across their driveways. People driving should carry snow chains and an emergency kit.</li>
<li><strong>Create an emergency plan&nbsp;</strong>with your family or work colleagues that emphasizes telecommuting, public transit and emergency meeting locations for your Monday morning commute. Check our&nbsp;<a href=""/winter?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Winter Weather Center</a>&nbsp;to see the priority snow and ice routes nearest you.</li>
<li><strong>Know your elevation, and the elevation of areas you are traveling to and through.&nbsp;</strong>Check the interactive elevation map in the ""Elevation, Weather and Traffic"" section of&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/winter?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">PBOT&rsquo;s Winter Weather Center</a>&nbsp;to see if your area is located at 500 feet or 1,000 above sea level.

As of Sunday evening, Maintenance Operations has&nbsp;gone into Incident Command System (ICS) mode, working around the clock in 12-hour shifts. We are treating our anti-icing routes. We are watching the forecast and will adjust our response accordingly, including plowing and salting city streets.</p>
<p>PBOT works to keep vital public transit lines and emergency routes open in winter weather. These priority snow and ice routes are the most critical for our city&rsquo;s police and fire stations, hospitals, schools, frequent bus routes, the downtown core and major business districts -- about a third of our entire street grid. PBOT&rsquo;s mission is to provide at least one passable lane in each direction on these priority routes so that vehicles with front-wheel drive or traction devices can get through. In a major snowfall, it can take our crews up to 12 hours to cover these priority routes once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please give PBOT crews time and space to do their work in winter weather. Our crews drive equipment in low visibility and extreme weather. DO NOT cut in front of them or try and pass them at any time. Even if they are going slow, you will find the road much clearer and safer behind a snowplow than in front!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume you know what their job is. Our crews perform multiple jobs with their trucks, not just plowing. If you see a truck with its plow up, they may be travelling between points on their route, refueling, responding to an emergency or otherwise doing tasks to keep the city moving during winter weather.</p>

<p>The cultural and economic hub for the state, Portland&rsquo;s central city is growing rapidly. By 2035, the central city&rsquo;s population is projected to triple and the number of jobs will increase by 40 percent. The area is already home to a dense mix of housing, including a significant percentage of the city&rsquo;s affordable housing. As the Central City and its economy grows, more and more people are using its streets, sidewalks and transit systems.&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/ccim?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Central City in Motion (CCIM)</a>&nbsp;is PBOT&rsquo;s plan for strategic investments to accommodate more people on Central City streets. Like parallel projects in other parts of the city&mdash;including&nbsp;East Portland in Motion&nbsp;and&nbsp;Southwest in Motion&mdash;Central City in Motion identifies and prioritizes investments in the Central City transportation network. The 18 projects identified in Central City in Motion are designed to make transit faster and more reliable, biking safer and more convenient, and ensure pedestrian crossings are safe and accessible.</p>

News,713554,"PBOT Travel Advisory: National Weather Service warns of potential snow in Portland area late Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, affecting morning commute",1,,2019-02-27 01:16:05 UTC,2019-02-27 00:30:00 UTC,A,,"<h1><a href=""/transportation/47307?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery""><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/02/2381156/2490676/20181107-twitter-image_crop.png"" alt=""Sasquatch Get Ready for Winter"" width=""590"" height=""295"" /></a></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">(Feb. 26, 2019) The National Weather Service has notified the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) of the potential for accumulating snow of a half inch to 2 inches in the Portland area late Tuesday night and continuing into Wednesday morning commute hours. Temperatures may remain low for much of the morning on Wednesday, so snow that accumulates may linger.</span></p>
<p>There may be more accumulations in areas south and west of Portland, so everyone should check the elevation and weather conditions at your home, your destination and areas along your route before starting a trip. Conditions will likely vary across the metropolitan area, depending on elevation and proximity to colder winds from the Columbia River Gorge.</p>
<p>PBOT advises the public to be aware of forecasts, use caution, delay your travel to avoid traveling during forecast snow or ice. Consider public transit, and check&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://trimet.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#alerts/"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">trimet.org/alerts</a>and&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://portlandstreetcar.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">portlandstreetcar.org</a>&nbsp;for service alerts before you go.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">PBOT also reminds property owners, tenants and businesses that they are responsible for clearing sidewalks of snow and ice. It is important that sidewalks are clear so that people who are walking to transit and people with disabilities can move about safely.</span></p>
<p>In snowy and icy conditions, PBOT strongly advises delaying travel if possible. If people must travel, PBOT recommends taking public transit.</p>
<p>While the forecast is still unclear, there are some simple things all Portlanders can do to prepare themselves for winter weather.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a checklist for your home, business, and/or vehicle.&nbsp;Property owners, tenants and businesses should have supplies on hand, such as ice melt and snow shovels to clear sidewalks as well as pathways across their driveways. People driving should carry snow chains and an emergency kit.</li>
<li>Create an emergency plan&nbsp;with your family or work colleagues that emphasizes telecommuting, public transit and emergency meeting locations for your Monday morning commute. Check our&nbsp;<a href=""/winter?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Winter Weather Center</a>&nbsp;to see the priority snow and ice routes nearest you.</li>

<p>(Feb. 28, 2019) Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly and Interim PBOT Director Chris Warner joined Ride Connection, transportation providers and partners in the disabled community to announce PDX WAV, a new program to make it easier for Portlanders with disabilities to hail a wheelchair-accessible taxi, Uber or Lyft ride.</p>
<p>Portlanders who rely on wheelchairs generally wait a disproportionate amount of time for a ride, and often are not able to hail a ride at all. To improve service, PBOT has developed PDX WAV, a new program that makes reliable, safe, private for-hire services more accessible for people who rely on mobility devices.</p>
<p>Commissioner Eudaly, whose son Henry uses a wheelchair, said she knows from personal experience that this service can make an enormous difference for people with disabilities.</p>
<p><!--[if gte vml 1]>                               <![endif]--><!--[if !vml]--><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/02/2423893/2542145/pbot-pdxwav-wave-wheelchair-logo-blue_crop.png"" alt=""PDX WAV Wheelchair Logo Blue"" hspace=""7"" width=""211"" height=""211"" align=""left"" /><!--[endif]-->This partnership between the City and private for hire transportation will directly improve the lives of many Portlanders with disabilities by providing safe, reliable, accessible transportation,&rdquo; Eudaly said. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s launch of PDX WAV shows that we are making local progress toward equity for all Portlanders and finding innovative ways to collectively achieve our goals as a community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""When it comes to taxi, Uber and Lyft rides, we have three fundamental goals,"" Warner said. ""We want it to be easy for Portlanders to get a ride. We want those rides to be safe. And we want those rides to be accessible to every Portlander.&nbsp;With PDX WAV, we're taking a big step forward in providing Portlanders with mobility devices with the same level of service enjoyed by everyone else.""</p>
<p>A key partner in PDX WAV is Ride Connection, a non-profit that specializes in transportation for seniors and people with disabilities. Ride Connection will provide the dispatch service for PDX WAV customers during business hours. On nights and weekends, 211Info will handle dispatch.</p>
<p>&rdquo;The PDX WAV program will begin to address transportation equity in our community and we are honored to play a role in the project by providing dispatch center support,&rdquo; Ride Connection Chief Executive Officer Julie Wilcke Pilmer said.</p>

<p class=""gdcaption""><em>Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly describes how important WAV service is for people, such as her son, who depend on wheelchairs. Photo by Dylan Rivera / PBOT.</em></p>
<h2 class=""gdcaption content-center""><em></em>How it works</h2>
<p>To make it easy for passengers who want to take a taxi, PBOT has partnered with Ride Connection and 211 to create this central Wheel Chair Accessible Vehicle dispatch center.</p>
<p>Instead of having to call around to different companies to try and find a ride, customers only have to call one number: 503-865-4WAV (865-4928).</p>
<p>They can call 24-hours a day, 7-days a week, every day of the year. A friendly dispatcher will locate an accessible taxi for the customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that one call, the customer has access to any available taxi provider, and can request the closest available vehicle, regardless of company. Customers can also request their favorite company or driver.</p>
<p>PDX WAV's goal is to have rides pick up customers within 30-minutes. Fares vary by company, but are required to be equivalent to non-wheelchair accessible taxi services.</p>
<p>The program will provide cash incentives for taxi companies, Lyft and Uber to provide the rides, which are more expensive than standard rides because of the cost of accessible vehicles.</p>
<p>Passengers who want to hail an Uber or Lyft can use each company's app.</p>
<h2 class=""content-center"">Depends on local control, innovation</h2>
<p>The new PDX WAV service is made possible thanks to a 50-cent surcharge on Uber and Lyft rides and permit fees paid by taxi companies. Proposed state legislation (HB 3023) would eliminate the surcharge and remove the City's ability to protect local consumers and ensure equal service for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Commissioner Eudaly implored the companies to work with PBOT to collaborate on ways to expand service across the state without limiting the ability of Portlanders to come up with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Warner, the interim PBOT director, noted that the City would not be able to collect fees from Uber and Lyft to pay for service for people with disabilities. And the bill would strike down the City's rules that prohibit Uber and Lyft from charging disabled passengers higher fares during times of congestion and high demand, known in the industry as ""surge pricing.""</p>

<p>(March 1, 2019) Calling all artists, designers, and creative Portlanders who want to showcase their work at Design Week Portland!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pop-Up Place: Innovating the Future of Social Infrastructure&rdquo; is a design and build competition as part of the<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.portlandinthestreets.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;Portland in the Streets</a>&nbsp;program. A division of the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT), Portland in the Streets is focused on the ways we can re-imagine our public spaces and right-of-way, from streets to parking spaces, sidewalks to plazas, and much more. Let&rsquo;s show off Portland&rsquo;s design community&rsquo;s world class skills with the exciting new design principals around placemaking!</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://designportland.org/festival/2019/schedule/pop-up-place-innovating-the-future-of-social-infrastructure?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">design and build competition's</a>&nbsp;goal is to show how using&nbsp;<strong>street furniture, large-scale games and modular sculpture</strong>&nbsp;can help bring Portlanders out to play in city streets.</p>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s signature Portland in the Streets program, Sunday Parkways, has always been a great place to test our imagination. Two years ago, we began setting up a temporary Portland-themed putt-putt course at all of Sunday Parkways events. The minute we would set it up, families would swarm in to play a fun and free game. The course was such a hit that the Willamette Week featured it in their&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.wweek.com/sports/2017/07/11/did-you-know-you-can-play-a-9-hole-portland-themed-mini-golf-course/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Best of Portland in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Knowing that putt-putt was so popular, we decided to reach out to Design Week Portland about doing a design competition to create other temporary placemaking elements that spark our community&rsquo;s imagination. Our goal is to make our street events like Sunday Parkways, block parties, and other special events more fun and engaging.</p>
<p>There are three categories for competition: street furniture, large-scale games, and modular sculpture. Entrants will be on display at Portland City Hall during Design Week, voted on by the public, and winners will receive a beautiful trophy from Felling Design Studio. All entry details can be found online at:&nbsp;<a href=""https://designportland.org/festival/2019/schedule/pop-up-place-innovating-the-future-of-social-infrastructure?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">https://designportland.org/festival/2019/schedule/pop-up-place-innovating-the-future-of-social-infrastructure</a></p>
<p>Come by for our opening reception on Monday, April 8 from 6 to 8 p.m. Then, stop in anytime that week up until 2:00 p.m. on Friday, April 12 to play, sit, admire, and vote for your favorite entry!</p>

<h2 class=""content-center"">When adopted, the plan will replace the city&rsquo;s current pedestrian plan, which was last updated in 1998.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(March 5, 2019) After two years of study and collaboration with community partners, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is ready to showcase&nbsp;<a href=""http://pedpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">PedPDX: Portland&rsquo;s Citywide Pedestrian Plan</a>&nbsp;for public review. The bureau is seeking feedback from Portlanders to help PBOT shape the plan for the better before it goes to City Council in late Spring. The public comment period, which began yesterday, is open until May 3.</p>
<p>With PedPDX, PBOT aims to make walking safer and more comfortable across the city by putting pedestrians at the forefront of its policies and by emphasizing investment in crossing improvements and other pedestrian-focused projects. In the plan, PBOT identifies the key strategies and tools the bureau could use to make Portland a great walking city for everyone. Through PedPDX, PBOT affirms walking as a human right and the most fundamental means of transportation.&nbsp;When adopted, the plan will replace the city&rsquo;s current pedestrian plan, which was last updated in 1998.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard over and over from people that they do not feel safe walking in Portland. Through PedPDX, Portland is making a public commitment to significantly expanding the number of marked crossings in the city, including a new requirement to mark crossings within 100 feet of all transit stops,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;Applying these progressive new crossing spacing guidelines to Portland&rsquo;s street network will require us to provide approximately 3,500 new crosswalks on busy arterial and collector streets throughout the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People walking in Portland are ten times more likely than people driving to sustain a serious or fatal injury. As a Vision Zero city, no death on our streets is acceptable. But we have limited resources to address our immense safety needs,&rdquo; said PBOT Interim Director Chris Warner.&nbsp; &ldquo;This plan provides a data-based approach to pedestrian improvements that will make sure we are focused on the greatest needs first, in an equitable way.&rdquo;</p>

This feedback directly influenced the plan&rsquo;s prioritization of new sidewalks and crossings, as well as the strategies and actions in the PedPDX &ldquo;Implementation Toolkit.&rdquo;</p>

Project staff compared survey responses to the racial and geographic distribution of the city&rsquo;s population. Out of the 5,405 total respondents to the PedPDX Citywide Walking Priorities Survey, 2 percent identified as African or African-American. However they represent 5.7 percent of Portland&rsquo;s overall population.</p>

PBOT staff worked with community partners from the Portland African American Leadership Forum (PAALF), Black Parent Initiative (BPI) and Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization (IRCO) Africa House to secure more input from the Black community and to better understand how their walking experience may be different because of their racial and ethnic identities. Facilitators provided a space for black Portlanders to speak candidly about their &ldquo;<a href=""/transportation/78224"">Walking While Black</a>&rdquo; experience in Portland, which the feedback shows is different from other community members.</p>

Walking While Black focus group participants rated &ldquo;poor lighting&rdquo; as the biggest barrier to walking, with an average rating of 5.0, while it was ranked significantly lower than in the citywide survey responses.</p>

Participants shared that they regularly make travel choices based on how safe and visible the route feels, and often choose travel options that are longer or more expensive as a result.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 5px; font-style: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.5;"">In addition to answering the two PedPDX survey questions, the facilitators wanted to capture more information about the unique experiences of the Black community to better understand their transportation concerns and barriers. During the focus groups, the 2017 MAX incident was elevated as having a lasting impact on feelings of safety in public spaces and during travel commutes. While participants acknowledged that this was an extreme event, many participants shared experiences they have had on public transit or in public spaces that made them feel exposed and vulnerable to racially-motivated attacks.</p>

Action 6.1 introduces new lighting-level guidelines that will increase lighting on public streets as new capital projects and private development goes in. Actions 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 are intended to address issues of safety and security in the public right-of-way, reinforcing our commitment to equity and eliminating disparate outcomes due to race. In addition to increasing lighting in underserved communities, these actions include partnering with other agencies and city bureaus to advance the well-being and personal security of vulnerable communities, and continuing to research racial bias and driving behavior.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"">The past year was full of growth for BIKETOWN and its sister-programs, BIKETOWN for All and Adaptive BIKETOWN. This year&rsquo;s BIKETOWN expansion made it easier and more affordable to explore Portland. PBOT provided an option for lower cost membership, expanded BIKETOWN&rsquo;s service area and made it easier to park BIKETOWN bikes throughout the city. BIKETOWN lowered its annual membership for unlimited rides by 30 percent to $99. A new pay-as-you-go plan now costs $5 at signup and only 8 cents per minute after that. BIKETOWN also introduced a new $19 month-to-month plan for regular BIKETOWN users who don&rsquo;t want to commit to an annual membership. On June 1, BIKETOWN introduced two service improvements. BIKETOWN expanded the service to eastside Portland neighborhoods along the 50s Bikeway including Grant Park, Creston-Kenilworth, Laurelhurst, Beaumont-Wilshire, Cully as well as Hollywood where residents have, repeatedly asked for service. As a new benefit, BIKETOWN allowed annual and BIKETOWN for All members to lock to any public bike rack in the service area for free. Additionally, PBOT has designated 45 sets of bike racks across the city as &ldquo;community corrals&rdquo; that act the same as the orange BIKETOWN stations where parking is free for BIKETOWN users.</span></p>

BIKETOWN saw a huge increase in ridership with 79,399 rides for a total of 164,252 miles biked. That was more than double the number of trips ridden in May of 2017! We also set new one-day trip records nine times in May, with a new all-time high of 4,792 trips on Sunday, May 27! This smashed the previous record by over 1,000 trips. Over 14,000 Portlanders and visitors rode BIKETOWN in May, of which 78 percent were first-time BIKETOWN riders.</p>

The program is a partnership with Albertina Kerr Center&rsquo;s Kerr Bikes and offers short-term rentals of adaptive bicycles such as hand-cycles, tricycles and tandems. The program offers a staffed service to assist in fitting people on the bicycles, a place to store mobility devices, and a location with direct access to Portland&rsquo;s multiuse trail system. In 2018, Adaptive BIKETOWN added 2 electric-assist trikes and counted 189 rentals. The two most popular adaptive bikes were foot-powered trikes and hand-powered trikes, with 35 percent of riders identifying as first-time adaptive bike riders and 87 percent of riders were TriMet Honored Citizen Passholders. The pilot project originally launched in summer 2017 and will move to a formal program in May 2019.</p>

The 495 BIKETOWN for All members took 36,089 trips over the course of the last year. Since October 2018, new BIKETOWN for All members automatically receive a $3 credit to pay for their first month. This eliminates the initial financial hurdle to start riding for those who qualify for SNAP, low income housing, and other forms of financial assistance. After signing up, many BIKETOWN for All members generate additional credits on their balance by doing tasks that support a well-balanced bike-share system, like returning bikes parked outside of a BIKETOWN station back to a station. All new BIKETOWN for All Members receive that first month free in the form of a $3 Pay-It-Forward credit and agree that when they generate enough credit to pay for their next six months of membership ($18), $3 will be donated from their account back into the Pay-It-Forward program. &nbsp;The &ldquo;Pay-It-Forward&rdquo; campaign, introduced in late 2018, invited BIKETOWN members to donate credits to the BIKETOWN for All program. The result was over $1,500 donated to provide a free first-month of service for up to 514 future BIKETOWN for All members.</p>

BIKETOWN bike-share service provides flexibility for day-to-day activities, as well as a fun and healthy way to move around Portland. More than a third of surveys showed members would be more likely to use BIKETOWN if electric bikes were added or if the service area was expanded. The 2020 BIKETOWN expansion will encompass PBOT&rsquo;s Strategic Plan and goals, making sure we keep a focus on equity and provide greater access for those not currently served by bike-share.</p>

Safe Ride Home helps to achieve the City of Portland&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action Plan&rsquo;s goal of launching initiatives to reduce impaired driving.&nbsp;According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), during the 2016 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day holiday period, almost two-fifths (39%) of all motor vehicle crash fatalities in the United States involved drunk driving.</p>

News,726139,"News Release: PBOT announces two projects for new, safer connections through inner NE Portland neighborhoods",1,,2019-03-21 17:33:52 UTC,2019-03-21 17:20:00 UTC,A,"Guided by the citywide racial equity goals, PBOT releases a plan to address the needs of everyone in the neighborhood.","<p>(March 21, 2019) Major improvements to pedestrian and biking connections are coming to Irvington, Sabin, Alberta, Vernon, and Woodlawn neighborhoods, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced today. Following a robust public process with neighborhood residents, transportation advocates, and community organizations, and guided by the city&rsquo;s racial equity goals, the bureau announced two major projects &ndash; a new bikeway on NE Ninth Avenue and a comprehensive safety project on NE Seventh Avenue called &ldquo;Safer 7th.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/03/2465893/2588620/lloyd-to-woodlawn-overview-map-3-20-2019-b_crop.png"" alt=""Lloyd to Woodlawn map"" hspace=""7"" width=""277"" height=""881"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>The decision to build a bikeway on NE Ninth Avenue and establish the Safer 7th project came about after additional public outreach and focus groups. This outreach found that the major changes needed to make a bikeway on NE Seventh Avenue did not have broad public support. This two-project solution incorporates the safety and access needs expressed by all neighbors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Portland City Council unanimously adopted&nbsp;<a href=""/oehr/68111?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland&rsquo;s Racial Equity Goals and Strategies</a>&nbsp;which directs city services to &ldquo;strengthen outreach, public engagement, and access to city services for communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities, and support or change existing services using racial equity best practices&rdquo; among its equity goals. Since then, PBOT has focused its efforts on broader public involvement and engagement.</p>
<p>As the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/75668?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd to Woodlawn</a>&nbsp;project team began sharing design options with the neighborhood, it became clear that Black community organizations in the neighborhood were concerned about how traffic diversion on NE Seventh Avenue would impact their access to the multiple Black community institutions on the street and the people they serve.&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/700519?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">At an open house in August 2018</a>, many community members expressed that the proposed street designs would impact their traffic patterns without increasing their travel options. As a result, PBOT held two focus groups and had a series of conversations with community leaders about the travel needs of people who have historically been served by those institutions. Having heard these concerns, PBOT revised its designs to ensure the project provided better connections and access for all neighborhood stakeholders. The final projects on NE Ninth and NE Seventh avenues reflect the feedback the bureau received.</p>
<p>Both the NE Ninth Avenue bikeway and Safer 7th will reduce conflict between people, improve safety for everyone, and establish a low-stress pedestrian and biking route connecting the neighborhoods of Woodlawn, Vernon, Sabin, King, and Irvington to both the Lloyd District and the new Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing bridge over I-84, coming in 2020.</p>
<p>On NE Ninth Avenue, PBOT will make crossing busy streets safer for pedestrians and people biking, including crossings that are part of PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Routes to School program connecting to King and Irvington Elementary Schools. Traffic diverters are proposed where NE Ninth Avenue crosses Ainsworth, Emerson, and Webster streets, reducing the volume of motor vehicles where the volume exceeds city standards for neighborhood bikeways, known as greenways. Users will be able to travel through Irving Park as they travel north and south through the area. An improved route through Irving Park is currently not surveyed, designed or funded. When we have that capacity, PBOT and Portland Parks and Recreation will seek funding for a route that will provide an improved connection through the park.<img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/03/2465894/2588621/lloyd-to-woodlawn-simulation-page-2_crop.jpg"" alt=""NE Ninth photosimulation"" width=""590"" height=""370"" /></p>
<p>The Safer 7th project will reduce conflict and improve safety along NE Seventh Avenue, particularly in areas where people walk and play along the corridor. PBOT will install new speed bumps and paint new street markings to reduce speeding. We&rsquo;ll remove existing traffic circles to reduce conflict between people. And we'll build safer crossings along popular school and pedestrian routes. In addition, the bureau will improve where NE Seventh Avenue crosses Going, Morris, and Tillamook streets, connecting these neighborhood greenways with signs, street markings, and by adjusting the location of stop signs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a bike lane on NE Seventh Avenue from Tillamook to Weidler streets will create a complete connection to the Sullivan&rsquo;s Crossing, a new bridge over I-84, coming in 2020.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/03/2465895/2588622/lloyd-to-woodlawn-simulation-page-1_crop.jpg"" alt=""Lloyd to Woodlawn photosimulation NE 7th"" width=""590"" height=""366"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;PBOT is committed to building a safe, sustainable transportation system, but for our system to succeed, we need it to be built with the needs of all Portlanders in mind,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;We have broad support for creating a Safer 7th that reduces conflict and improves safety for everyone. NE Ninth Avenue is a well-used walking and biking route today, and PBOT&rsquo;s design will reinforce its role as a family-friendly route through Northeast Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so grateful for the Black community&rsquo;s engagement in this process and look forward to continuing to work with them on future projects,&rdquo; said Interim Transportation Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;Our best plans and projects are those that incorporate the feedback of all neighbors and, in the end, we find that people often agree with each other more often than not. All of us want safer streets for our children and to get to where we are going comfortably, efficiently, and affordably, no matter how we travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Street Trust supports the decision to locate the greenway on NE Ninth Avenue because improvements on Ninth can deliver the low-car experience needed to make a variety of cyclists feel comfortable, without disrupting access to institutions on NE Seventh Avenue serving people of color,&rdquo; said Jillian Detweiler, Executive Director of The Street Trust. &ldquo;This decision honors the input of community members who have been historically marginalized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout the process, PBOT was open to listening, learning and responding to community concerns,&rdquo; said Ron Herndon, Director of Albina Head Start, which has been serving predominantly Black children and families in the neighborhood since 1965 and at their NE Seventh Avenue location since 1992. &ldquo;As a result, these projects are a fair representation of the community and neighborhood&rsquo;s interests. These improvements on NE Seventh Avenue will make it safer for families traveling to our organization, without limiting their access. Albina Head Start supports a Safer 7th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""NECN sincerely appreciates and supports PBOT's effort to have authentic outreach and engagement with diverse stakeholders regarding the Safer 7th project,"" said Adam Lyons, Executive Director of the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PCRI&rsquo;s participation in the PBOT greenway focus group was the first of many steps towards the inclusion and representation of all the voices that make Portland great and progressive. While the greenway was the topic, it underscored a larger healing conversation that is needed where the Black communities are able to express the hurtful impact of rapid city development when their voices are silenced or forgotten,&rdquo; said Bonnie Bright, Portland Community Reinvestment Initiatives (PCRI) Resident Services Coordinator at the Margaret Carter Community Center. &ldquo;PCRI looks forward to continuing to support PBOT by serving as a liaison towards inclusion of the Black voices of Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself and many other people live on NE Seventh had hoped for more to be done on our street, but we are glad that we got to participate in the community conversation and that everyone agreed that making a safer street benefits all,&rdquo; said Kiel Johnson from the Friends of 7th&nbsp;Avenue group. &ldquo;It is very important for our city to listen to the voices who have historically not had a say in our city&rsquo;s policies and I am glad those voices were heard here. This summer we are going to be organizing a series of block parties every Sunday on Seventh&nbsp;so that neighbors can build new relationships as our community continues to change. In the end a stronger, safer, more connected community is what we all want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PBOT was proactive in getting the feedback of our community. They listened to the good, the bad and the ugly&hellip; but most importantly they just LISTENED.&nbsp;We appreciate that our feedback was heard and are hopeful it will be used throughout the implementation,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Anthony Deloney, Director of Strategic Initiatives at Self Enhancement, Inc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were impressed with the approach PBOT used to navigate both the business and cultural sensitivities that arose during this process. Their rapid response to our concerns of negative business impact, and the level of sincerity and conscientiousness to work with our historic community to find a solution was a refreshing change from past experiences,&rdquo; said John Washington, Chair of the Soul District Business Association. &ldquo;Improving the safety of Seventh Avenue and moving forward with Ninth Avenue as&nbsp;a neighborhood greenway, is a win/win for all who travel, work and play within this corridor and we support it wholeheartedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the neighborhood greenway route decided, PBOT will now move forward with the design and engineering for both NE Seventh and NE Ninth avenues. Construction for both projects is currently estimated to begin in Spring 2020. The&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/75668?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd to Woodlawn Greenway</a>&nbsp;is expected to cost $552,000 for design, engineering and partial implementation. Funding is provided through PBOT&rsquo;s Fixing Our Streets.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;is the result of the passage of Measure 26-173, a 10-cent gas tax and Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source dedicated to street repair and traffic safety projects citywide. Fixing Our Streets helps PBOT do preventive street maintenance that saves money and prevents potholes. It also supports the bureau&rsquo;s work to make it safer for children to walk to school and allows the bureau to build more sidewalks, traffic signals, streetlights and bike lanes.&nbsp;The bureau is currently working to identify funding for the remaining elements of each project.</p>
<p>PBOT is committed to increasing diversity, advancing equity and fostering inclusion in everything that we do. PBOT&rsquo;s Equity and Inclusion Program will continue to deepen the engagement of racially diverse populations that have been historically underserved by the bureau. These efforts include the expansion of community partnerships, resources for community-led ideas and building more internal capacity to implement racial equity, disability and language access initiatives. In 2019 PBOT will be working to establish a transportation equity framework to further clarify the bureau's racial equity commitments, goals and intended outcomes.

<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">Companies could start service this year with a total 2,500 e-scooters citywide among all companies, compared with 2,043 deployed during the 2018 program. Companies may be able to expand their fleets if they follow all regulations and implement innovative programs that help meet city goals, such as eliminating sidewalk riding, eliminating improper parking, generating high ridership in East Portland. By January, PBOT estimates that companies may qualify for incentives that could lead to 9,000 total e-scooters in Portland.</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">If all companies qualify for all incentives, Portlanders could see a total 15,000 e-scooters by January. But the bureau&rsquo;s incentive criteria are ambitious, involving technology that may still need to be developed.&nbsp;The permit also maintains a number of fail-safe measures, including the transportation director's ability to restrict a company's fleet size, suspend a company's permit, or pause the pilot.&nbsp;</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">Companies can score higher in the application process if they are able to provide e-scooters with seats, which could provide a more comfortable transportation option for more people. They may also score higher if they offer e-scooters that can be locked to public bike racks, reducing incidents of e-scooters parked blocking sidewalks and ADA corner ramps.</li>

<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">Companies will be required to issue notifications, warnings, fines, and account suspensions to users who are not operating e-scooters legally. PBOT regulatory specialists will monitor sidewalks, documenting instances of illegal scooter riding and parking and providing those to the companies. After receiving a warning, e-scooter riders may receive a fine of $50 for riding on sidewalks, or $15 for illegal parking.</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">PBOT staff will monitor and audit the companies&rsquo; efforts to disincentivize and penalize unsafe rider behavior and respond to public reports of illegal parking.</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">Companies will be required to use geofencing technology to prohibit scooter riders from parking in Tom McCall Waterfront Park, including the multiuse path located along the Harbor Wall. Riders will not be able to end a trip in the park and will receive warnings and fines for repeated offenses of abandoning e-scooters in city parks.</li>

<li style=""margin-bottom: 5px; font-size: 15px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; text-align: left;"">A shortage of safe places to ride led many to ride e-scooters on sidewalks in 2018. To make more safe places to ride e-scooters, e-scooter riders will be charged a 25 cent street use fee, and companies will be charged a 5 to 20 cent right-of-way fee to generate funding to build safe places for people to use e-scooters, such as protected bike lanes and neighborhood greenways. PBOT learned in the first pilot that where e-scooter users had safe places to ride in the street, sidewalk riding decreased. These investments will also improve safety for people walking, biking or using mobility devices.&nbsp;</li>

<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">(March 25, 2019) &ndash; The Portland Bureau of Transportation and Portland Police Bureau will conduct a crosswalk safety education and enforcement action on Wednesday, March 27, at the marked crossing on Southeast Powell Boulevard at Southeast 54th Avenue from noon to 1:30 p.m. to raise awareness of pedestrian safety and Oregon traffic laws. PBOT also reminds Portlanders to watch for people walking at all hours of the day or night.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk, whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.</p>
<p>The crossing on Southeast Powell Boulevard at Southeast 54th&nbsp;Avenue has a marked crosswalk, median island and signage. A number of destinations nearby generate pedestrian traffic, including Franklin High School, St. Mark's Lutheran Church and various local businesses.</p>
<p>Southeast Powell Boulevard, a Vision Zero designated <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwMzI2LjM3MDU0MDEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwMzI2LjM3MDU0MDEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM2NDE2MyZlbWFpbGlkPXBib3Rjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uc0Bwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPXBib3Rjb21tdW5pY2F0aW9uc0Bwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/59277?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">high crash network street</a>, had a total of 122 fatal and serious injury crashes in 2007-16, the most recent 10-year period for which data are available. The intersection of Southeast 54th Avenue at Southeast Powell Boulevard had a total of 18 crashes including no fatal or serious injury crashes, during this same time period.</p>
<p>Southeast Powell Boulevard has also had three fatal crashes since January 2017.</p>
<p>People walking legally in Portland and hit by a person driving who fails to stop for them, is the number one cause of pedestrian crashes resulting in death and serious injury. People driving can do their part by having more patience, driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the March 27 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to achieve, Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk education and enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A Portland Bureau of Transportation staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

Work zones play a key role in maintaining and upgrading Portland's roadways, water and sewer infrastructure and more. Unfortunately, daily changes in traffic patterns, narrowed rights-of-way, and other construction activities often create a combination of factors resulting in crashes, injuries, and even fatalities. These crashes also cause excessive delays, especially given the constrained driving environment. Recent statistics from the National Highway Safety Administration&rsquo;s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) show there were a total of 158,000 work zone crashes total in 2016 across the United States&mdash;of which 42,000 were injury-involved crashes that resulted in 61,000 injuries. On average, in 2015, a work zone crash occurred once every 5.4 minutes.</p>

The OHSU Knight Cancer Institute opened in 2018 at 2720 SW Moody Ave. and will see improved access upon the completion of SW Bond Avenue and SW Meade Street later this year.

In addition, PBOT convened eight separate community focus groups to help staff identify infrastructure needs unique to specific communities. Participants included OHSU Campus Outreach, SW Trails, Markham Elementary Somali Families, Congregation Kesser Israel and others.</p>

Recent trends suggest that more and more people in Southwest Portland are choosing to get out of their cars and walk, bike, roll, or take transit instead.

This applies to home owners, business owners, schools and other large institutions. Traditionally the requirement to construct sidewalks where they are missing or deficient is triggered when development or redevelopment projects are proposed. As part of the development, property owners must construct or improve the sidewalks fronting their property in accordance with City standards. This is how the vast majority of sidewalks have historically been built in the City of Portland. The mature sidewalk system in inner Portland that was constructed with development (often over 100 years ago) still serves residents today.</p>

Many of these annexed areas still retain some of their rural character, and they continue to have insufficient infrastructure to meet the needs of people walking.</p>

A data-based approach to prioritizing sidewalk and crossing needs also helps ensure that we provide needed improvements in an equitable manner across the city, rather than responding to individual requests which may not always be where demands of safety, equity, and pedestrian need are greatest.</p>

Community members were asked to choose between two design options: a roundabout or a traffic signal. While more members of the community supported the roundabout option, there were concerns about the design not creating a clear separation for people walking and biking. There was also overwhelming consensus for PBOT to build this important safety improvement in a timely manner. With a significant cost difference between the roundabout design and a traffic signal &ndash; estimates for a roundabout were approximately $6M versus $4M for a signalized intersection &ndash; the bureau determined the best course of action was to proceed with the traffic signal option as securing additional funding for the roundabout design could put the project on hold indefinitely.</p>

News,729831,News Release: E-scooters return to Portland streets today,1,,2019-04-26 16:26:24 UTC,2019-04-26 16:22:00 UTC,A,"Three companies -- Bolt, Lime and Spin -- will have permits today; four other companies may follow in coming weeks.","<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">(April 26, 2019) Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced that it will issue permits to three scooter companies: Bolt, Lime and Spin. After picking up their permits today and applying the required permit stickers, the companies may start service. Portlanders should expect to see scooters on the street over the course of the day.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Four additional companies -- Clevr Mobility, Jump, Razor USA, Shared Technologies, Inc. -- are in the final stages of submitting the required scooter specifications and other information necessary for a permit. If they qualify, PBOT expects them to launch their fleets in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">If any of the four companies do not meet all of the final requirements for a permit, PBOT may choose to take the next highest scoring applicant from the remaining companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">With today&rsquo;s launch, PBOT is starting its second <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwNDI2LjUxOTYxNjEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwNDI2LjUxOTYxNjEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM3MjU1MyZlbWFpbGlkPWhhbm5haC5zY2hhZmVyQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZ1c2VyaWQ9aGFubmFoLnNjaGFmZXJAcG9ydGxhbmRvcmVnb24uZ292JmZsPSZleHRyYT1NdWx0aXZhcmlhdGVJZD0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/77294?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #00a0ae;"">Shared E-scooter Pilot Program</span></a>. This second pilot will last until April 26, 2020. It follows a 120-day pilot program that PBOT conducted from July through November last year.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;Our first e-scooter pilot demonstrated two things: scooters have the potential to be a fun and useful transportation option for Portlanders, and we need to address significant safety and equity concerns. That&rsquo;s why we are launching this second pilot,"" said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;Our streets are a valuable public asset - if private industry wants access to our streets, they have to demonstrate alignment with our values and priorities, pay a reasonable fee for the privilege, and deliver social benefit. This second scooter pilot will allow us to gather more data, increase equity and accessibility, and make the most of this &lsquo;last mile&rsquo; technology in Portland.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">&ldquo;At PBOT, our goal is to build a safe transportation system that helps our city reduce its carbon footprint and supports our commitment to equity,&rdquo; said Chris Warner, PBOT&rsquo;s Interim Director. &ldquo;With the launch of the second pilot, we have a great opportunity. Not only will Portlanders again have access to this technology, but we have the chance to learn more about scooters and whether they contribute to a safer, more sustainable and more equitable Portland.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">The initial pilot showed that scooters were very popular, with Portlanders and visitors taking over 700,000 rides in the four-month period. Based on data and user surveys, PBOT also found evidence that scooters had the potential to reduce congestion and pollution. At the same time, the initial pilot raised concerns about sidewalk riding and improperly parked scooters.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Based on these and other findings, PBOT has introduced key changes for the second pilot aimed at improving public safety, ensuring wide access to scooters, especially in East Portland, and providing funding for safety improvements.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">These key changes include:</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Fleet incentives</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">. PBOT has capped the initial number of scooters at 2,500, the same limit as the first pilot. However with the second pilot, companies may be able to expand their fleets if they follow all regulations and implement innovative programs that help meet city goals, such as eliminating sidewalk riding, eliminating improper parking and generating high ridership in East Portland. By January, PBOT estimates that companies may qualify for incentives that could lead to 9,000 total e-scooters in Portland.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">New measures to reduce illegal and dangerous riding.</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;""> Companies will be required to issue notifications, warnings, fines, and suspend accounts of users who are operating scooters illegally. PBOT regulatory specialists will monitor sidewalks, documenting instances of illegal scooter riding and parking and providing those to the companies. After receiving a warning, riders may receive a fine of $50 for riding on sidewalks or $15 for illegal parking. PBOT staff will monitor the companies&rsquo; efforts to significantly decrease unsafe rider behavior and respond to public reports of illegal parking.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">New tools to discourage scooter riding in Waterfront Park.</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;""> Companies will be required to use geo-fencing technology to prevent scooter riders from ending their trips in Tom McCall Waterfront Park, including the multiuse path located along the Harbor Wall. Riders will not be able to end a trip in the park and will receive warnings and fines for repeated offenses of abandoning e-scooters in city parks.</span></p>

A shortage of safe places to ride led many people to ride scooters on sidewalks during the 2018 pilot. To make more safe places to ride scooters, riders will be charged a 25-cent street use fee and companies will be charged a 5- to 20-cent right-of-way fee. PBOT will use the funds generated to build safe places for people to use scooters, such as protected bike lanes and neighborhood greenways. PBOT learned in the first pilot that where scooter users had safe places to ride in the street, sidewalk riding decreased. These investments will also improve safety for people walking, biking or using mobility devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An extension of BIKETOWN, Portland&rsquo;s bike share program, Adaptive BIKETOWN is a bike rental service focused on increasing bicycle access to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Initiated as a pilot project in 2017, this is Adaptive BIKETOWN&rsquo;s third season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very pleased that Adaptive BIKETOWN is open for the 2019 season and now includes electric-assist adaptive bikes,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;There is still a great deal of work to be done to achieve equity in transportation, but an expanded Adaptive BIKETOWN is a strong step forward that acknowledges the needs of Portlanders with disabilities and further integrates adaptive bikes into our bike share system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of PBOT&rsquo;s celebration of National Bike Month, Adaptive BIKETOWN rentals will provide 90 minutes of free ride time for those that qualify for a TriMet Honored Citizens pass from May 9 to May 19.</p>
<p>Adaptive BIKETOWN will also be at every Sunday Parkways this year showcasing different adaptive bikes at each event, beginning with <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwNTA4LjU2NjYxODEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwNTA4LjU2NjYxODEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM3NTIyNCZlbWFpbGlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;110&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/67621?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Southeast Portland Sunday Parkways on May 19</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Albertina Kerr is proud to be a partner in making the Adaptive BIKETOWN vision a reality here in Portland,&rdquo; said Albertina Kerr CEO Jeff Carr. &ldquo;Enriching people&rsquo;s lives by providing accessible and appropriate bike rental options is consistent with our vision of creating a more inclusive community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Riders can choose from 15 different bikes that are designed for people with a range of abilities. The fleet includes hand-powered cycles, foot-powered cycles and multi-rider cycles. Through a grant from Nike, Adaptive BIKETOWN added two electric-assist foot-powered cycles in 2018.</p>
<p>The Adaptive BIKETOWN bicycles are available for rent at <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwNTA4LjU2NjYxODEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwNTA4LjU2NjYxODEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM3NTIyNCZlbWFpbGlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;112&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.albertinakerr.org/KerrBikes/Overview.aspx?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Kerr Bikes</a>&rsquo; OMSI location along the Eastbank Esplanade. The rental cost is $5 per hour or three hours for $12 for people with disabilities, seniors and those who qualify for a TriMet honored citizen pass. Rental prices are higher for others.</p>
<p>Kerr Bikes encourages first-time renters to register in advance for a bike fitting, to ensure that the bikes are properly adjusted for the best ride. Those measurements will be saved, allowing for easy walk-in rentals for future rides. Walk-in registration is allowed, but participants should expect the fitting process to take from 15 minutes to one hour.</p>
<p>The growing use of Adaptive BIKETOWN speaks to the demand for adaptive bicycle access in Portland. In 2018, rentals increased 220 percent over 2017. The vast majority of riders (87 percent) qualified for a TriMet Honored Citizens pass. This 87 percent is composed of people with disabilities, seniors, and those living on low incomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adaptive BIKETOWN offers folks the ability to choose within their abilities a recreational vehicle of sorts to experience our beautiful city,&rdquo; said Deidre Hall a member of the community advisory committee that advised PBOT on the program&rsquo;s design. &ldquo;As a person with a disability myself, I hadn&rsquo;t ridden an adaptive bicycle since childhood and I was so thrilled to be given the opportunity to do so as an adult&hellip;Watching the program take shape and the smiles on the faces of my fellow disability community members experiencing the excitement and empowerment of adaptive bicycle riding, many for the first time, has been priceless.&rdquo;</p>

It is about 10 feet wider to accommodate sidewalks on both sides of the bridge and has been constructed to be ADA accessible.

The new bridge&rsquo;s design life is 75 years.</p>

The new lane provides more space for buses and bikes and reduces potential conflict between buses, cars and bikes. It includes a passing zone to help people on bikes bypass buses at stops and prohibits right turns onto SW 3rd&nbsp;Avenue to remove the risk of right hooks for people walking and biking.</p>
<p>To provide the space for the new bus lane, on-street parking for government vehicles &ndash; Portland Police and PBOT Parking Enforcement &ndash; was removed.</p>
<p>SW Madison is an important bus route serving five TriMet bus lines: 2, 6, 10, 14, and 30. Combined, these lines provide more than 23,000 trips each day, connecting riders to jobs and services in Downtown Portland from Lents, East Portland, North Portland, Gresham, and Estacada. The Central City in Motion project will implement a total of nine dedicated bus and Business Access and Transit (BAT) lanes, helping employees and others who travel into the Central City to access jobs and other services.</p>

In partnership with TriMet, PBOT is making improvements along numerous bus routes across the entire city by installing new BAT lanes and other features to improve transit efficiency. PBOT is currently awaiting FHWA approval to pilot red painted lanes commonly associated with transit lanes and will be strategically adding the red paint to further distinguish the BAT lane in the future.</p>

<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the May 22 event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to achieve Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>People driving can do their part by having more patience, driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed. PBOT also reminds Portlanders to watch for people walking at all hours of the day or night, and that it is illegal to drive in the center turn lane.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor how people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A PBOT staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

<p>(May&nbsp;21, 2019) In three short years, the <a href=""/transportation/64188"">Fixing Our Streets Program</a> has added sidewalks on key routes, making it safer and more convenient for people to walk and access public transit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, Portlanders will enjoy 48 new blocks of sidewalks, thanks to the Fixing Our Streets Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final two Fixing Our Streets sidewalk projects go to construction this year, starting with NE 148th&nbsp;Avenue between Halsey and&nbsp;Glisan&nbsp;this summer and SW Capitol Highway from Multnomah Village to West Portland in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets projects have generated jobs for <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwNTIxLjYxNDQ3ODEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwNTIxLjYxNDQ3ODEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM3Nzc2NSZlbWFpbGlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPWR5bGFuLnJpdmVyYUBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://flic.kr/s/aHsmic6fMq?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">local minority contractors</a>, including&nbsp;Emerio&nbsp;Design for engineering, and&nbsp;Raimore&nbsp;Construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Projects completed in 2018 closed critical gaps in sidewalks along SE&nbsp;Flavel&nbsp;Street, NE 102nd Avenue and SE 112th Avenue and add 16 new ADA-compliant curb ramps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By closing the gaps between existing sidewalks, the projects created a full 2.25 miles of streets in East Portland with complete sidewalks on both sides on the street. The result is safer access for neighborhood residents to schools, public transit and work.&nbsp;</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li data-leveltext=""&middot;"" data-font=""Symbol"" data-listid=""13"" data-aria-posinset=""1"" data-aria-level=""1"">On NE 102nd, the new sidewalks provide a much-needed safety improvement. 102nd Avenue is one of the most dangerous streets in Portland for pedestrians. PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action plan ranks it in among the top 20 streets where pedestrians are killed or injured.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sidewalk provides a seamless walking route between Prescott Elementary and the Gateway Transit Center.&nbsp;</li>
<li data-leveltext=""&middot;"" data-font=""Symbol"" data-listid=""13"" data-aria-posinset=""2"" data-aria-level=""1"">On SE 112th, the new sidewalks improve walking connections along a large north-south corridor and connect destinations like Kelly Butte Natural Area, Floyd Light Middle School and Mall 205.&nbsp;</li>

<p>All three projects were identified in the East Portland in Motion plan as having strong community support but remained unfunded until voters approved Measure 26-173, which created the Fixing Our Streets Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program, paid for by a local gas tax approved by Portland voters in May 2016 and a heavy vehicle use tax, is Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source for transportation. Fixing Our Streets is invested in street maintenance and safety improvements. The City Council ordinance included a project list that shows specific projects that are intended to be funded.

<p>(May 28, 2019) In the coming weeks, Portland's <a href=""/transportation/64188?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets Program</a> will start grinding and repaving Southwest Capitol Highway in the Multnomah Village business district and North Denver Avenue in the Kenton area.</p>
<p>Those are just two of eight <a href=""/transportation/71432?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">paving projects</a> in construction this year with the program.</p>
<p>Thanks to Fixing Our Streets, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is able to maintain more streets sooner, preventing potholes for years to come and avoiding the need for more expensive road reconstruction. Well maintained streets are fundamental to getting Portlanders from place to place safely and comfortably.</p>
<p>Everyone has a financial stake in street maintenance, because it is essential to stewardship of the City of Portland's&nbsp;largest and most valuable asset: its network of 4,800 lane miles of pavement on city streets, worth a replacement value of more than $8 billion.</p>

<p class=""gdcaption""><em>Video by Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>Grind and pave projects maintain the street pavement by removing the top layers of asphalt and replacing them with fresh layers that provide a smooth surface to withstand rain, heat and snow, virtually pothole free for 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p>PBOT crews focus their paving work on keeping streets from falling into poor or very poor condition. This approach saves Portland money because the worse a street&rsquo;s condition, the more expensive it is to fix.</p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/64188?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;has provided funding for contractors to do work that involves deeper, more expensive road paving improvements. The program has generated jobs for a wide variety of private contractors that work on paving, excavation, and concrete, as well as electrical workers who install traffic signals. That's because repaving can often trigger the need for new corner ramps, sidewalk repairs or signals.</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets has helped more widely share Portland's economic prosperity. The program started with a goal of awarding more than 30 percent of contracts to&nbsp;Disadvantaged, Minority-Owned, Women-Owned, Emerging Small Businesses, Service Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises (D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE) contractors.</p>
<p>The program more than doubled that goal--awarding 68 percent of its low-bid contracts to D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE firms, creating opportunities for businesses and workers who historically have not enjoyed equal access to economic opportunity.</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets paving projects will not meet all of Portland&rsquo;s pavement maintenance needs, but they represent a significant step in the right direction. They will help Portland close the gap and get more streets into the condition that Portlanders expect.</p>

The $1.7 million project will build over 3000 feet of new sidewalk (the equivalent of 15 downtown city blocks) on the east side of NE 148th from NE Halsey Street to NE Glisan Street.</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""width: 590px; height: auto; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/06/2613174/2711958/148th-avenue-sidewalk-infill_crop.jpg"" alt=""NE 148th Street Infill"" width=""590"" height=""763"" /></p>
<p>The project will fill existing gaps in the sidewalk, creating a contiguous sidewalk along this important street. Nine corner ramps and fifteen driveways will also be updated during construction to bring them up to current ADA standards. Thanks to the Fixing Our Streets funding, Portlanders will have an easier and safer time reaching Halsey HydroPark, Glenfair Elementary and the TriMet bus stops on Halsey and Glisan. The project will be finished by winter 2019.</p>
<p>The NE 148th project is one of the final two sidewalk projects funded by Fixing Our Streets. The other project --&nbsp;SW Capitol Highway from Multnomah Village to West Portland -- will start in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the end of 2019, Portlanders will enjoy 48 new blocks of sidewalks, thanks to Fixing Our Streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT has also used Fixing Our Streets to support more widely shared economic prosperity in Portland. At the start of the program, the agency pledged that 30% of Fixing Our Streets contracts would be awarded to D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE firms. PBOT has already far exceeded this goal. To date, more than two-thirds&mdash;68%&mdash;of Fixing Our Streets low-bid contracts have gone to D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE firms. Interlaken, the construction firm responsible for the NE 148th project, is a D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE certified firm.</p>

<p>Last year, Fixing Our Streets funded projects that closed critical sidewalk gaps in other parts of East Portland,&nbsp;including along SE&nbsp;Flavel&nbsp;Street, NE 102nd Avenue and SE 112th Avenue.&nbsp;By closing the gaps between existing sidewalks, the projects created a full 2.25 miles of streets in East Portland with complete sidewalks on both sides on the street. The result is safer access for neighborhood residents to schools, public transit and work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the repaving of N Albina Street, the road will be restriped with an improved street configuration to benefit bus and automobile traffic.&nbsp;During repaving projects, PBOT seeks to improve traffic operations and safety for all road users. By combining maintenance projects with operational improvements, such as new striping configurations, PBOT maintains the transportation system and improves travel conditions more efficiently.</p>
<p>Currently, vehicles trying to turn left from N Albina onto N Alberta Street and N Rosa Parks Way must use a single through travel lane. During the most congested times of the day, those left turning vehicles can block automobile traffic and TriMet's Line 4 buses.&nbsp;To improve automobile operations and keep buses moving, PBOT plans to add left turn lanes on N Albina Street approaching the intersections with N Alberta Street and N Rosa Parks Way. Line 4 buses travel through these intersections over 150 times on weekdays, with buses arriving every 15 minutes or better much of the day every day,&nbsp;providing&nbsp;access to St Johns, PCC Cascade, Emanuel Hospital, and Downtown Portland.</p>

<p>The project extends from SE 50th Avenue to the western edge of the Lents Town Center at SE 90th Avenue. The changes to the street and urban design transformed Foster Road from a high speed, auto-oriented corridor into a more balanced streetscape that is safer and more accessible for people walking, biking, taking transit and driving. Additionally, the new design supports and enhances the growing mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Funding for the $9 million Foster Road project came from the&nbsp;Fixing our Streets Program, the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal&nbsp;District, Portland Transportation System Development Charges&nbsp;and a federal grant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you to the community for your patience and understanding throughout the construction of this project. It has been many years of planning, development and construction, but I know it was worth the wait,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;I am particularly looking forward to the events and activities that PBOT and community organizations have put together on SE Foster Road for the summer! Now that construction is finished, it&rsquo;s time to get out and enjoy this public space together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a street that will support a vibrant commercial district, that will add to the quality of life in this neighborhood, and that people &ndash; whether they are walking, biking, rolling or driving &ndash; will want to use every day,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;To me, that is the power of what we do. We don&rsquo;t just make Portland a better place to get around, we make it a better place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a small business owner, I&rsquo;m especially pleased to celebrate better connections for businesses and residents in east Portland,&rdquo; said Peter Platt, Prosper Portland Commissioner and founder and owner of Andina Restaurant. &ldquo;The completion of the Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project marks a milestone in Prosper Portland&rsquo;s strategic goals to pursue transportation improvements in east Portland to realize job growth, increase connectivity and complement community-drive action plans&hellip;creating healthy, complete neighborhoods throughout Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""As we celebrate our new streetscape on Foster, we celebrate the potential for equitable neighborhood growth,"" said&nbsp;Shea Flaherty Betin, Director of the Portland Mercado. ""We envision increased economic opportunity along Foster for small businesses, for POC entrepreneurs, and for the thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem we have here at the Mercado.

<p>""The Foster Area Business Association is pleased to celebrate the completion of the Foster Streetscape project. We welcome Foster Road's transition from a highway to a main street for our district and the surrounding neighborhoods,&rdquo; said Allen Rowand, President of the Foster Area Business Association. &ldquo;We look forward to Foster being safer for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers, as well as bringing more visibility and easier access to our businesses. The Streetscape is the next step in Foster's growth as a destination and we thank PBOT for their support of the district throughout the project.""</p>

<p>(July 10, 2019) Work has begun on a series of safety improvements at NE 122nd Avenue and Marine Drive, including a new traffic signal. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.portlandparks.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a>&nbsp;are partnering on the improvements, which will make the intersection safer and improve access to the nearby multiuse path.</p>
<p>Currently, the T-intersection at NE 122nd Avenue and Marine Drive has a stop sign with a flashing red light for traffic turning onto Marine Drive. Traffic on NE Marine Drive does not have to stop, often causing long backups during peak travel hours for people wanting to turn from 122nd. The new signal will help drivers on 122nd Avenue to turn onto Marine Drive. It will also include a protected left turn for people turning from westbound Marine Drive onto southbound 122nd Avenue. Additional features include a bike signal to help people on bikes cross Marine Drive from the southeast corner of the intersection, allowing them to connect to the westbound bike lane on Marine Drive. The traffic signal is located on a flood control levee for the Columbia River, so PBOT coordinated with Multnomah County Drainage District and obtained permits from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This traffic signal is an important step towards a safer Marine Drive and achieving our Vision Zero goals,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;I am thankful to our Parks &amp; Recreation bureau partners for supporting this important infrastructure investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project is part of a series on Marine Drive between NE 33rd and 185th avenues, one of Portland&rsquo;s high-crash streets. PBOT will install new rapid-flashing beacons and streetlights at NE 138th and NE 185th avenues, upgrade an existing yellow-flashing beacon at NE 112th Avenue to a rapid-flashing beacon, and add buffered bike lanes from NE 112th to 122nd avenues.</p>
<p>PBOT will also be installing shoulder and centerline rumble strips from NE 33rd to 185th Avenues. On Marine Drive, 19% of crashes are lane-departure crashes where a person drives out of their travel lane. On average, centerline rumble strips reduce all crash types by 9% and head-on or sideswipe crashes (which are often serious) by 44%. On average, shoulder rumble strips reduce crashes by 36%.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2016 on Marine Drive between NE 33rd and NE 185th avenues, there were 189 total crashes including 4 fatalities and 144 injuries. Since January 2017, six more fatalities have occurred along this segment. In May 2019, the speed limit on this stretch of road was reduced from 45 to 40 mph. There are fixed speed safety cameras located in two locations on the corridor &ndash; westbound near NE 138th Avenue and eastbound near NE 33rd Avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This critical safety investment has been a long time coming, we&rsquo;re grateful to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for helping us obtain the funding for this new signal,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;The new intersection will be safer for everyone &ndash; whether they are walking, biking, or driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With support from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the project will also fill in gaps in the multiuse path adjacent to the road between NE 112th and NE 185th Avenues. The two-way multiuse path is&nbsp;<a href=""http://40mileloop.org/wordpress/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">part of the 40-Mile Loop</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to our PBOT partners for working with Parks on improvements to the Marine Drive path,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;The new trail will be safer and easier to access for all users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Project funding comes from&nbsp;$1,077,000 through a Regional Flexible Funds Grant from the federal government obtained by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and administered through&nbsp;<a href=""http://oregonmetro.gov/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Metro</a>. Other project funding includes $589,000 in&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/38516?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Parks System Development Charges (SDCs</a>) and $50,000 from the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT)&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/40390?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Vision Zero</a>. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation obtained the grant and did preliminary design work with PBOT finishing out the project for the City.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is proud to have secured the grant for substantial work on the Marine Drive Trail project,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Adena Long. &ldquo;Better safety and increased accessibility will help all trail users, and we look forward to the project&rsquo;s completion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parks System Development Charges (SDCs) are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Park SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.</p>
<p>Construction will be ongoing through the summer with all elements scheduled for completion by the end of 2019.

<p>(July 11, 2019) On Monday, Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) crews will begin work on the NE 102nd&nbsp;Avenue Safety Project. Informed by extensive conversations with neighbors and community stakeholders, the project will add better pedestrian crossings, new bike lanes with more separation between people driving and people biking and make it easier for residents to get to transit stops.&nbsp;The project is funded by the&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;Program.</p>
<p>NE 102nd&nbsp;Avenue is a&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/59277?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">high crash street</a>&nbsp;for people walking, meaning it is one of Portland&rsquo;s most dangerous streets for pedestrians. Between 2012-2016 there were 258 total crashes, including nine pedestrian crashes, six bicycle crashes. Since 2014, there have been three fatalities on NE 102nd&nbsp;Avenue.</p>

<p>To make the street safer, especially for people walking, PBOT crews will install a center turn lane, a motor vehicle lane in each direction of travel, a parking lane on each side of the street, a buffered bike lane on each side of the street and modifications to the striping on the street. Construction will take approximately two weeks, between 3 a.m. and 3 p.m., with periodic lane closures during that time. During construction, please travel cautiously, observe all lane closures and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.

<p>PBOT will monitor the results of these safety improvements and collect data on safety, vehicle speeds, vehicle and transit delay, and traffic&nbsp;on nearby streets. The bureau will also collect feedback from the community.</p>
<p>If the initial changes show positive results, PBOT will add more safety measures to the street. These could include converting temporary pedestrian refuge islands to permanent concrete installations, adding a new sidewalk at Fremont and 102nd and building new ADA accessible curb ramps along the street, among others.</p>
<p>To inform the planning and design process the project team&nbsp;held two open houses, in April 2018 and January 2019, to collect&nbsp;feedback and answer questions from the community, and present project designs. The project team collected&nbsp;additional&nbsp;feedback via an online survey and coordinated with numerous local organizations, including&nbsp;the&nbsp;City of Maywood Park, Parkrose Heights Neighborhood Association, Parkrose Neighborhood Association,&nbsp;Mount Hood Community College,&nbsp;Parkrose Business Association, and East Portland Chamber of Commerce.

<p>This project will adjust the location of the pedestrian refuge island on the north side of the intersection and will create a new pedestrian refuge island at the south side. In addition, the new design opens the eastern crosswalk to pedestrians and&nbsp;adds a pedestrian signal to the crosswalk between the NE corner and the pedestrian island on that corner. All corners and curb ramps will be upgraded to current ADA accessibility standards.</p>
<p>The new intersection geometry is designed to accommodate a WB-67 design vehicle (a 53&rsquo; semi truck and trailer). The existing design does not fully accommodate those large vehicles.&nbsp;Other intersection changes include creating a turn lane for northbound traffic from NW 23rd&nbsp;Avenue heading onto the U.S. 30 ramp toward I-405 and reconfiguring the two eastbound travel lanes on NW Vaughn St to one thru lane and one right turn only lane. All of these changes will improve safety as well as help traffic flow much better through the intersection and improve transit operations for TriMet buses - frequent service line 15 as well as lines 24 and 77 travel through this intersection.</p>

<p><em>By Katie MacDougall, PBOT</em></p>
<p>(July 15, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) advises the traveling public that work on the NE 42<sup>nd</sup> Avenue Bridge over NE Lombard Street will keep the bridge closed to all traffic for one week, starting Wednesday. NE Lombard Street and NE Portland Highway (Route 30 Bypass) will not be affected. The closure is scheduled to start at 7 a.m. on July 17 and go through 3 p.m. on&nbsp;July 24.</p>
<p>Local access will be maintained between the bridge and the intersection of NE 42<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and Columbia Boulevard, to the north, but through traffic over the bridge will not be allowed.</p>
<p>A biennial bridge inspection revealed a need for maintenance on the 42<sup>nd</sup> Avenue Bridge. Two of the four grout pads were worn out and the bridge had sunk 2 inches. The maintenance repairs will raise the bridge to its original height above Lombard Street and replace the grout pads. This is a short-term repair to maintain the bridge&rsquo;s service condition.</p>

<p>(July 18, 2019) Members of the Gateway community, the city&rsquo;s Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) Director Chris Warner, and Prosper Portland Executive Director Kimberly Branam gathered today to cut the ribbon on the Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project and celebrate the transformation of the Gateway Regional Center&rsquo;s retail core.</p>
<p>The Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project has brought to life a vision first outlined in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://prosperportland.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Opportunity-Gateway-Concept-Plan-and-Redevelopment-Strategy.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Opportunity Gateway Concept Plan</a>, approved by city council back in early 2000. The plan envisioned a future for the Regional Center in these terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Groups of people can be seen moving in and out of buildings, sitting in outside caf&eacute;s, jogging on streets, and celebrating community events at the Gateway Station Plaza. Day and night, the area buzzes with activity. Cars still stream through the area, actually in greater numbers than before. Yet ironically it doesn&rsquo;t feel that way. On-street parking buffers pedestrians from street traffic, new street connections have dispersed cars, traffic lights are coordinated, and accidents have been reduced by 90%. The traffic level feels safe and under control.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project has now made this vision a reality, through a joint project with Prosper Portland and by coordinating several other PBOT projects in the neighborhood.</p>

Photos by Google Streetview (left) and Pierre Haou, Portland Bureau of Transportation (right).</em></p>
<p>New curb extensions and marked crosswalks, new rapid-flashing beacons and better lighting already make crossing the street a more comfortable experience throughout the business corridor. The new, bright-green parking-protected bike lanes along Halsey and Weidler provide an extra buffer from vehicle travel lanes. And we&rsquo;ve added more on-street parking.</p>
<p>PBOT crews installed new streetlights with their own unique design and made the sidewalks wider to make more room for benches, bicycle racks, trash cans, and other street furniture. And they turned NE 103rd Avenue between NE Halsey and Clackamas streets into a &ldquo;festival street&rdquo; that can be closed to traffic for community events and which serves as a bookend to the corridor&rsquo;s west entrance.<br /><br /></p>

<p><em>Pedestrians cross at the new rapid flashing beacon at NE 106th and Halsey. Photo by Pierre Haou, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>Today, Gateway neighbors gathered to celebrate at the eastern end of the corridor, the second bookend known as the &ldquo;East Entry Triangle,&rdquo; a new public plaza bordered by NE 112th Avenue, Halsey and Weidler that formerly sat vacant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These streets belong to all of us, and everyone has the right to feel safe whether they are walking, biking, or rolling on them,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;I am so pleased that not only does the Halsey Weidler Streetscape Plan bring safety to the forefront with improved pedestrian crossings and reduced speeds, it creates a new public plaza, and will help local businesses in the Gateway District.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get ready, Gateway! This Sunday, over 20,000 people will bike, walk, and roll through this neighborhood for the Outer Northeast Sunday Parkways,&rdquo; said Transportation Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be fun to see so many people experience what we already know and love about the Gateway neighborhood &ndash; it&rsquo;s diverse community, it&rsquo;s charming business district, and &ndash; now - it&rsquo;s fantastic sidewalks, public plazas, bike lanes, and neighborhood greenways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The completion of the Halsey Weidler Streetscape Project marks a milestone in Prosper Portland&rsquo;s strategic goals to pursue transportation improvements in East Portland that contribute to job growth, increase connectivity, and complement the Gateway Action Plan,&rdquo; said Kimberly Branam, Executive Director of Prosper Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our children enjoy riding their bikes to the new Gateway Discovery Park and now we can ride safely to Gateway Green as a family, thanks to our new bicycle lanes and greenways,&rdquo; said Lisa Ortquist, a neighborhood resident and mother of three children aged 10 to 24 who has owned her business, Ortquist &amp; Associates, PC, at NE 112th Avenue and Halsey Street for the past 20 years. &ldquo;And on days when there&rsquo;s no school, my kids can now safely walk to get breakfast, ice cream and treats at the neighborhood shops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People attending&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/67624?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Outer Northeast Portland Sunday Parkways</a>&nbsp;this weekend will get to walk or ride a&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/733295?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">new 4.8 mile route</a>&nbsp;featuring the&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/77414?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">WALK with Refugees and Immigrants</a>.

<p>(July 19, 2019) Thousands of bus and bike trips through the central city will soon be safer, easier, and more reliable thanks to transportation improvements coming this summer and fall.</p>
<p>Next Tuesday, July 23, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) will host an open house in Old Town to share information about these efforts. Members of the public are invited to stop by the White Stag building at 70 NW Couch St. anytime between 5-7 p.m. to meet with PBOT and TriMet staff, learn about projects nearing construction, and weigh in on projects going into design.</p>
<p>PBOT will be sharing data from the recently completed bus and bike lanes on SW Madison Street as well as discussing a new Business Access and Transit (BAT) lane on NW Everett Street scheduled for installation next month and a new dedicated bus lane on the Burnside Bridge coming this fall. The bureau will also share plans for improvements on NW Flanders Street, Naito Parkway, and SW Fourth Avenue. Open house attendees will also learn about PBOT&rsquo;s current study focused on making transit better across the city.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to try leaving your car at home for your next downtown trip. Taking transit, biking, using a scooter, or walking and rolling as a pedestrian are all great ways to save money, help decrease congestion, and reduce our individual impact on climate change. PBOT, TriMet, and Portland&rsquo;s bike-share program BIKETOWN will all be giving out discounts and gear to help get you started.</p>
<p>Many of the projects featured at the open house were identified through the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71158?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Central City in Motion</a>&nbsp;plan. Central City in Motion is PBOT&rsquo;s guide for investing in our streets to create a smart, future-focused transportation system in the central city. These investments aim to make the entire system work better and provide more predictable travel times for businesses and residents.</p>

<p><em>In August 2019, a new business access and transit (BAT) lane will replace one of the existing travel lanes on NW Everett Street and run from NW Broadway to the Steel Bridge ramp. The ramp from southbound NW Naito Parkway to the Steel Bridge will close. This will improve transit reliability and access to the Rose Quarter, benefitting Portlanders who ride TriMet lines 4, 8, 16, 35, 44, and 77.</em></p>

<p>Under Oregon law, EVERY intersection is a legal crosswalk, whether it is marked or unmarked. People driving must stop and stay stopped for people walking when the pedestrian is in the travel lane or the adjacent lane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crossing on East Burnside Street at 16th&nbsp;Avenue has a marked crosswalk, median island and signage.&nbsp; In addition, &ldquo;stop here&rdquo; signage and stop lines indicate where drivers stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk, making all travelers more visible. Southeast 16th&nbsp;Avenue is a designated neighborhood greenway one block south, starting at SE Ankeny Street. The surrounding area includes businesses, residences and schools, with elementary, middle and high schools within a half mile. Buses for TriMet lines 12, 19, and 20 travel through this intersection and serve the surrounding community.</p>
<p>Changes are coming next year to the crossing at 16th Avenue. Improvements include rapid flashing beacons funded by the&nbsp;<a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwNzMwLjg1ODYxNzEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTkwNzMwLjg1ODYxNzEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNzM5MTQ3MCZlbWFpbGlkPWNpdHlwaW9ncm91cEBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmdXNlcmlkPWNpdHlwaW9ncm91cEBwb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YmZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/625882?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Fixing Our Streets (FOS) Safe Routes to School (SRTS)</a> program.

<p>The most common cause of crashes resulting in death or serious injury to people walking is when they are walking legally and struck by a person driving who fails to stop.&nbsp;People driving can do their part by having more patience, driving at or below the posted speed, continuously scanning the environment looking for people walking and bicycling, and being ready to stop as needed.&nbsp;PBOT reminds Portlanders to watch for people walking at all hours of the day or night, and that it is illegal to drive in the center turn lane.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education and enforcement actions such as the July 31&nbsp;event are a key part of the City of Portland&rsquo;s citywide effort to achieve Vision Zero, the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
<p>Each crosswalk enforcement action involves a designated pedestrian crossing at a marked or unmarked crosswalk while police monitor whether people driving, bicycling and walking adhere to traffic safety laws. Drivers who fail to stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk and pedestrians who fail to follow Oregon traffic laws may be issued a warning or citation. A PBOT staff member will serve as the designated pedestrian crossing the street during Wednesday&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>Crosswalk education and enforcement actions are an effective way to communicate traffic laws to people driving and walking. The transportation and police bureaus do education and enforcement actions in response to requests by community members, city traffic safety engineers, and Portland Police to educate the general public on the rules at marked and unmarked crossings.</p>

Rendering by Jake Marshall, Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>
<p>(August 8, 2019) Portlanders commuting by bus on NW Everett Street from NW Broadway to the Steel Bridge will notice a more efficient commute next week, following the installation of the NW Everett Bus Lane Project this weekend by Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) crews.</p>
<p>The NW Everett Bus Lane project will improve transit reliability and access to the Rose Quarter for thousands of commuters on TriMet bus lines&nbsp;4, 8, 16, 35, 44 and 77 by creating a Business Access and Transit (BAT) lane approaching the Steel Bridge. BAT lanes are primarily dedicated for transit use but allow some general traffic circulation for turning into driveways or onto intersecting streets. The new bus lane will replace one of the existing travel lanes on NW Everett and run six blocks from NW Broadway to the ramp up onto the Steel Bridge. The project will also close the ramp from southbound Naito to the Steel Bridge to reduce the number of merging conflicts and increase safety for vehicles crossing the bridge.</p>
<p>Transit is one of the most efficient, equitable, and sustainable ways to move people in cities. Improvements like these on NW Everett Street reduce congestion and make riding the bus more convenient and reliable, encouraging more Portlanders to leave their cars at home when traveling into the Central City.</p>
<p>In addition to MAX trains and private vehicles, the upper deck of the Steel Bridge carries over 4,000 daily commuters on TriMet bus lines&nbsp;4, 8, 35, 44 and 77. Data from TriMet shows that these buses are stuck in congestion approaching the Steel Bridge. On the average weekday evening commute, buses travel less than 10 mph when approaching the Steel Bridge and less than 5mph on the ramp to the bridge.</p>
<p>Congestion has been worsening for TriMet buses on the stretch of NW Everett between NW Broadway, resulting in delays that can ripple across the transit network. The average speed of Line 4-Fessenden, for example, has decreased 14% in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>The new Business Access and Transit (BAT) lane on NW Everett will increase transit reliability, speed, and access to the Rose Quarter Transit Center. The project will also address merging conflicts on the ramps to the bridge by closing the southbound Naito ramp to the Steel Bridge, further improving transit commutes out of downtown. Parking will be maintained on both sides of NW Everett Street and people driving will still be able to make right turns to travel south from the BAT lane and access driveways. Traffic modeling predicts the Everett BAT lane will be a meaningful time saver for bus riders, providing up to a 50% time savings for TriMet buses in the project area.</p>

During the&nbsp;planning process, concern about traffic congestion on the approaches to Portland&rsquo;s Willamette River bridges was a recurring theme. The NW Everett Bus Lane Project and SW Madison Bus and Bike Lane Project, among other Central City in Motion projects, are helping reduce travel time for bus commuters. The NW Everett Bus Lane Project is one of 18&nbsp;<a style=""color: #00a0ae;"" href=""/transportation/71158?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Central City in Motion</a>&nbsp;projects.</p>

For the SW Madison Bus and Bike Lane Project, PBOT installed a protected bus and bike lane that allows buses to avoid congestion approaching the Hawthorne Bridge. TriMet&rsquo;s Line 2, 6, 10 and 14 all traverse the Hawthorne, and similar to buses crossing the Steel Bridge, were experiencing increasing delays in the evening commute. Early data from TriMet shows that in the project area Line 2 buses are now 20% faster in the evening commute, Line 10 buses are 12% faster all day, and buses on the Line 14 saw a 60% increase in reliability, meaning they are now more likely to be on schedule thanks to the BAT lane.</span></p>

<p>The NW Everett Bus Lane Project and SW Madison Bus and Bike Lane Project, among other Central City in Motion projects, are helping reduce travel time for bus commuters while also helping Portland tackle the climate crisis. More than 40% of local carbon emissions come from transportation, and local transportation emissions have increased in recent years. Switching to public transit is one of the most effective ways people can reduce their individual carbon footprint.</p>
<p>PBOT crews will work on Aug. 10 and 11 between 3 a.m. and 1 p.m. to install the new lane. During construction, one lane on NW Everett Street will remain open for people driving and biking. Sidewalks will remain open for people walking. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane detours and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.

News,739789,Traffic Advisory:  Night paving on W Burnside at 18th/19th  scheduled for August 15-16 as construction nears completion,1,,2019-08-13 23:58:04 UTC,2019-08-13 23:57:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(August 13, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) advises travelers that as construction on West Burnside at 18th and 19th nears completion, night work is required to repave the street. Beginning at 9 p.m. on Thursday, August 15 and again on Friday, August 16, crews will&nbsp;grind and pave the outer lanes of West Burnside and all lanes of SW Alder Street in the project area. Work will be completed by 6 a.m. each morning.</p>

One lane in each direction will remain open on W Burnside. Sidewalks will remain open for people walking. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane detours and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.

West Burnside is a difficult location for road work and PBOT greatly appreciates the patience and understanding of nearby residents and businesses as we work to wrap up this construction project.</p>

Once the fresh pavement has had 14 days to cure,&nbsp;crews will install the final striping including new marked crosswalks. Finally, they will remove the old signal equipment and poles. The project is expected to be substantially complete by the end of September.</p>

<h2><strong>Traffic Advisory:</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Demonstrations downtown may lead to limited road closures Saturday, Aug. 17</strong></h2>
<p>(Aug. 13, 2019) On Saturday August 17, the Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the public to expect a limited number of road closures in downtown Portland from about 11 a.m. through the afternoon. This is because of demonstrations where some publicly available social media postings indicate some participants intend to engage in criminal acts of violence.</p>
<p>The public is advised to avoid the area from SW Madison Street to SW Alder Street, and from SW Fourth Avenue to Waterfront Park.</p>
<p>Check trimet.org/alerts before heading out on transit, or sign up for TriMet service alerts by email or text message at <a href=""http://www.trimet.org/email"">trimet.org/email</a>.

<p>(August 29, 2019)&nbsp;Smooth&nbsp;streets are coming to North Portland as&nbsp;crews with the&nbsp;Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT)&nbsp;begin work on the N&nbsp;Denver&nbsp;Avenue (Lombard&nbsp;to Watts)&nbsp;paving project, funded by Fixing Our Streets. Work begins on&nbsp;Tuesday, Sept. 3&nbsp;and will continue until Nov. 1,&nbsp;weather permitting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well-maintained streets are vital to getting Portlanders from place to place easily, safely, and sustainably. PBOT is responsible for maintaining over 4,800 miles of city streets. PBOT focuses&nbsp;its&nbsp;paving work on keeping streets from falling into poor or very poor condition. This&nbsp;kind of preventative maintenance&nbsp;saves Portlanders&nbsp;money by avoiding the more costly repairs of streets that have failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to&nbsp;paving&nbsp;N&nbsp;Denver Avenue&nbsp;between&nbsp;N&nbsp;Lombard&nbsp;and&nbsp;Watts streets,&nbsp;PBOT crews&nbsp;will&nbsp;also&nbsp;improve safety conditions by&nbsp;adding&nbsp;safer pedestrian&nbsp;crossings and&nbsp;improving the existing bike lanes.&nbsp;These&nbsp;upgrades,&nbsp;which will include&nbsp;new striping&nbsp;and&nbsp;refuge&nbsp;islands at&nbsp;N&nbsp;Russet, Terry,&nbsp;and Watts&nbsp;streets&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;widening&nbsp;of&nbsp;preexisting&nbsp;refuge islands. Together, these improvements&nbsp;will increase the visibility&nbsp;and safety&nbsp;of pedestrians&nbsp;crossing N&nbsp;Denver Avenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Sept. 3 to Oct. 1, southbound traffic&nbsp;on&nbsp;N Denver Avenue between Lombard and Watts&nbsp;streets&nbsp;will be detoured to N Brandon Avenue.&nbsp;The same N Brandon Avenue detour will be in place for northbound traffic from&nbsp;Oct. 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;Nov. 1. Sidewalks and access to driveways will&nbsp;remain open throughout construction.&nbsp;During construction, we ask the public to travel&nbsp;with&nbsp;caution, observe all detours and directions&nbsp;provided&nbsp;by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;possible.

Photo courtesy of Google Street View.</p>
<p class=""content-left"">(Sept. 5, 2019) The segment of SW Capitol Highway, between SW Huber Street and Kerr Parkway will be getting a safety upgrade starting this Saturday, Sept. 7 as part of the Portland Bureau of Transportation&rsquo;s (PBOT) Vision Zero goal of eliminating deadly and serious injuries from Portland&rsquo;s streets.&nbsp;The project will make it easier and safer for people to cross the street and get to bus stops along this busy thoroughfare. The project will also reduce speeds and improve the existing bike lanes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a title=""Map of project area"" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/729906?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">View a map of the project area.</a></p>
<p>SW Capitol Highway is identified as a High Crash Street on PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero High Crash Network. From 2012 to 2016, there were 55 total crashes on the corridor, including: two serious injuries, six moderate injuries, 33 minor injuries, one bicycle crash, and two pedestrian crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;I think the new design will definitely help traffic flow and safety for drivers, bikers, and walkers,&rdquo; said Tina Tiedemann, owner of Bullseye Pub at SW Capitol Highway and Pomona Street. &ldquo;I believe anything we can do to increase the safety of all is a huge benefit.&rdquo; Bullseye Pub will be open for business during construction on Capitol Highway.</p>
<p>During phase one of the project, crews will restripe the roadway to provide one automobile lane in each direction with a center turn lane between SW Alfred Street and SW Stephenson Street. This striping will also add protection to existing bike lanes with plastic bollards or parking protection. Additionally, PBOT will optimize the traffic signal at SW Pomona Street and SW Capitol Highway to minimize vehicle backups. PBOT will also install a new marked crosswalk at SW 49th Avenue.</p>
<p>During phase two of the project later this fall, PBOT crews will build new pedestrian crossings with median islands and lighting at SW Coronado Street and SW Dickinson Street. They will also increase visibility at the existing crossing at SW Alfred Street with new street lighting and pedestrian islands. Lastly, PBOT plans to request speed limit reduction from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) from 35 mph to 30 mph.</p>
<p>The reason SW Capitol Highway from Huber Street to Kerr Parkway is a High Crash Corridor is, in part, due to it being a large multilane road. This type of road configuration encourages speeding and can be hazardous for pedestrians and for people driving.</p>
<p>Through the use of a center median and turn lane, and left-turn pockets at intersections, PBOT improves road efficiency, making it safer and ensuring it handles the same amount of traffic. The changes made by this project will resemble the following graphic:</p>

<p>PBOT expects these improvements to result in a 19-47% reduction in all crashes and an 11-46% reduction in pedestrian and bike crashes. Construction of phase one is expected to take about two weeks, though the timeline could be impacted by rain or unforeseen events. Vehicle travel will be reduced to one lane in each direction and travel times could be slower than usual.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on SW Capitol Highway,&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/676333?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">paving from Multnomah Boulevard to Texas Street</a>will be wrapping up later this fall, design plans for the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71661?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SW Capitol Highway: Multnomah Village &ndash; West Portland</a>&nbsp;project are reaching a 95% design milestone at the end of September, and PBOT continues to coordinate with ODOT on the scope of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/odot/projects/pages/project-details.aspx?project=20438&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">ODOT&rsquo;s Barbur Crossroads Safety Project</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why&nbsp;the focus on speed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>PBOT&rsquo;s&nbsp;Safe Routes to School program&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;biannual&nbsp;travel surveys from families of&nbsp;Portland students&nbsp;for&nbsp;the last decade.&nbsp;These surveys&nbsp;aim to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;kinds&nbsp;of&nbsp;barriers&nbsp;that exist for students&nbsp;which might&nbsp;keep them from walking or rolling to school.&nbsp;Year after year,&nbsp;the&nbsp;number one barrier listed by&nbsp;parents and guardians&nbsp;is &ldquo;traffic safety.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>PBOT's Safe&nbsp;Routes to School team frequently&nbsp;hears&nbsp;from concerned school staff, community members,&nbsp;and families about dangerous driver behaviors on their routes to school, particularly speeding and a failure to stop for people crossing the street at crosswalks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Many students in&nbsp;Southwest&nbsp;Portland walk or roll along narrow streets without sidewalks.&nbsp;PBOT installs&nbsp;speed bumps and cushions&nbsp;to make&nbsp;people driving&nbsp;slow down and follow the speed limit.&nbsp;Research shows that family-friendly&nbsp;roadways&nbsp;that feel safe and comfortable attract new riders, providing Portland families with more&nbsp;options&nbsp;to get to and from school.</p>

<p>Even families that live close enough to walk or roll to school&nbsp;may choose to take a car because of dangerous&nbsp;intersections and crossings&nbsp;along their route.&nbsp;Crossing safety was&nbsp;a&nbsp;top concern families reported to PBOT&nbsp;during the community outreach stage of&nbsp;planning&nbsp;these improvements.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How were&nbsp;projects chosen?&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In 2016,&nbsp;PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Routes&nbsp;to School team&nbsp;embarked on an extensive planning process to identify projects&nbsp;Portland families&nbsp;needed&nbsp;to get to school safely.&nbsp;PBOT staff and volunteers categorized and mapped six years of school travel&nbsp;data to capture&nbsp;comments from over&nbsp;3,000&nbsp;parents and guardians&nbsp;and&nbsp;understand what&nbsp;safety improvements&nbsp;they wanted to see.&nbsp;Safe Routes&nbsp;staff attended&nbsp;over 60 meetings and events with parents&nbsp;and&nbsp;guardians, school staff, parent leadership,&nbsp;and culturally specific parent groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>PBOT identified over 1,200 projects&nbsp;through&nbsp;this&nbsp;process. With&nbsp;feedback from school communities,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Stakeholder Advisory Committee&nbsp;and the Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee,&nbsp;the&nbsp;list was narrowed&nbsp;to a priority list of&nbsp;88 projects.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Safe Routes&nbsp;team&nbsp;verified the routes and projects with&nbsp;each school&nbsp;before moving&nbsp;forward and gaining approval&nbsp;for these 88 projects&nbsp;from City Council in June 2018.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
&nbsp;<img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""font-size: 12px; width: 589px; height: auto; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/09/2793245/2801579/community-outreach_crop.png"" alt=""Community outreach"" width=""589"" height=""396"" /></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The full&nbsp;prioritized list&nbsp;PBOT generated&nbsp;from this&nbsp;process will help&nbsp;with the implementation of these 88 as well as any&nbsp;future&nbsp;projects&nbsp;as new funding becomes available.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>More Safe Routes to School projects&nbsp;on the way&nbsp;</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>PBOT&nbsp;will be hard at work constructing more Safe Routes to School&nbsp;projects&nbsp;through the end of&nbsp;construction season.&nbsp;Families will continue to see improvements to their route to school thanks to Fixing Our Streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Work will begin at 10 p.m. Wednesday night, allowing Portland Thorns fans time to leave Providence Park after the match vs. North Carolina. Paving will be completed by 6 a.m. Thursday.&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sept. 5, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises that night paving on W Burnside will continue on Sunday evening, Sept. 8. Work will begin at 9 p.m. and will be completed by 6 a.m. on Monday morning. Crews have completed paving on the outer lanes of W Burnside, and will now pave the two innermost lanes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""gd_caption"">A freshly paved lane on W Burnside, looking west. Photo by the Portland Bureau of Transportation.</p>
<p>Nearby residents can expect construction noise and people driving can expect significant delays on West Burnside between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. One outer lane in each direction will remain open on W Burnside. Sidewalks will remain open for people walking. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane detours and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible. Learn what you can expect in our work zones and how you can help everyone stay safe by watching this video:&nbsp;<a href=""https://youtu.be/lx3RkJjkjSE?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">https://youtu.be/lx3RkJjkjSE</a></p>
<p>The night work is necessary to ensure crews can work in a safe and efficient manner without closing down this critical transportation corridor during the day. West Burnside is a difficult location for road work and PBOT greatly appreciates the patience and understanding of nearby residents and businesses as we work to wrap up this construction project.</p>
<p>Following this night work, crews will test and active the new traffic signals and install remaining concrete islands during regular working hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This work remains weather-dependent and the schedule may change.</p>
<p>These improvements are part of the West Burnside Multimodal Project, one of a series of safety improvements PBOT is making along the corridor.

News,741536,"PBOT Traffic Advisory: Crews open two lanes on North Going Street Bridge, with one lane of traffic each direction to Swan Island, as evaluation of damage from train crash continues",1,,2019-09-14 00:09:15 UTC,2019-09-09 16:07:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Sept. 8, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation advises the traveling public that as of 2:30 p.m. today, crews have opened two travel lanes on the North Going Street Bridge, which was closed on Saturday morning after a train crashed into bridge support columns.</p>
<p>Travelers are directed to the north side of the bridge, where one lane in each direction is open. A multiuse path that provides bicycle and pedestrian access on the north side of the bridge is also open. A detour route that was used over the weekend on N River Street -- a narrow, private street -- has been removed. The public should not use River Street any longer.</p>
<p>The North Going Street Bridge provides the only public street access to Swan Island, a key location for industrial employers, with hundreds of workers and significant freight traffic.</p>
<p>The public is advised to use caution. Expect significant congestion and travel delays in the area. The bridge normally has three travel lanes in each direction.</p>
<p>Structural engineers continue to investigate and assess the bridge damage. There is no timeline for when the other lanes may be reopened. It could take weeks or months to repair the bridge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Sept. 13, 2019) Structural engineers, maintenance workers and contractors for the Portland Bureau of Transportation have been tackling short-term and long-term fixes for the North Going Street Bridge, a crucial freight connection that was damaged by a Union Pacific Railroad derailment last weekend.</p>
<p>PBOT crews closed the bridge to all traffic on Saturday, Sept. 7, the day of the crash, and reopened one lane in each direction on Sunday, the day after the crash.</p>
<p>Early next week, PBOT anticipates opening a third travel lane on the bridge. This will create a second westbound lane, to give vehicles faster access to the island and reducing congestion that has affected North Greeley Avenue and Interstate Avenue during peak periods.</p>
<p>The third lane will be open, thanks to work this week by PBOT maintenance crews that repaired a section of the bridge deck, using jackhammers to remove concrete from the 89-year old bridge, and pouring new concrete on Thursday. PBOT engineers had found on Sunday that the deck was damaged in the derailment.</p>
<p>The third lane is expected to be available starting sometime the week of Sept. 16, but it is not certain exactly when. PBOT will provide a traffic advisory when it is open.</p>
<p>Other developments in the bridge repair include:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Union Pacific Railroad officials ask travelers to stay off of North River Street, a private street that runs through the company's Albina Yard. PBOT posted signs on the road as a detour route in the hours after the crash, but the narrow, private road cannot handle large volumes of traffic and some travelers got lost on private property this week in the area.</li>
<li>It may be several months before PBOT crews are able to open more lanes for traffic on the bridge. This weekend, Union Pacific is halting rail operations adjacent to the bridge column that was most severely damaged in the crash, so PBOT crews and contractors can safely dig around the base of the column for further inspection. Engineers are hoping to learn whether the footings and pilings that support the column were damaged.</li>
<li>PBOT staff are in contact with Swan Island stakeholders to hear their concerns and identify ways traffic can be managed in the coming weeks. Interested parties can <a href=""http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0mYXVpZD0mbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTkwOTEzLjEwMTc5NDYxJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE5MDkxMy4xMDE3OTQ2MSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE2NzgzMjExJmVtYWlsaWQ9ZHlsYW4ucml2ZXJhQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZ1c2VyaWQ9ZHlsYW4ucml2ZXJhQHBvcnRsYW5kb3JlZ29uLmdvdiZ0YXJnZXRpZD0mZmw9Jm12aWQ9JmV4dHJhPSYmJg==&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORPORTLAND/subscriber/new?topic_id=ORPORTLAND_273"" target=""_blank"">sign up for email or text message alerts</a> for updates.</li>

<h2>Two lanes currently available on the busy bridge</h2>
<p>As of 2:30 p.m. on Sunday Sept. 8, crews had opened two travel lanes on the North Going Street Bridge.</p>
<p>Travelers are directed to the north side of the bridge, where one lane in each direction is open. A multiuse path that provides bicycle and pedestrian access on the north side of the bridge is also open. The bridge normally has three travel lanes open in each direction.</p>
<p>The North Going Street Bridge provides the only public street access to Swan Island, a key location for industrial employers, with hundreds of workers and significant freight traffic.</p>
<p>The bridge has an estimated 35,000 vehicle trips a day (both directions combined), making it one of the busiest bridges in the region. By comparison, the Hawthorne Bridge has about 33,000 trips a day and the Morrison has about 52,000 trips a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Derailment, crash and response</h2>
<p>On Saturday, Sept. 7, Union Pacific locomotives pulling tank cars crashed into columns that support the bridge. There are no known injuries from the crash.</p>
<p>PBOT structural engineers assessed the scene on Sept. 7, and again the next day. After the train wreckage was removed, engineers could access more of the bridge on Sunday, Sept. 8, for further structural evaluation and damage assessment.</p>
<p>The northern side of the bridge does not appear to be damaged, but damage to other parts of the bridge was found on Sunday to be worse than initially thought. A second support column was damaged, and damage to the bridge deck was also discovered.</p>
<p>Further inspections will take place in coming days, which may include taking core samples and removing parts of the structure and surrounding soils to gain a better understanding of the extent of the damage.</p>

<p>(Sept. 15, 2019) As of 4:00 p.m. today<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;the Portland Bureau of Transportation has opened a third lane for travel on&nbsp;the North Going Street Bridge, a crucial freight connection that was damaged by a Union Pacific Railroad derailment last weekend.</p>
<p>This creates a second westbound lane to give vehicles faster access to the island and reduce congestion that has affected North Greeley Avenue and Interstate Avenue during peak periods.</p>
<p>PBOT crews closed the bridge to all traffic on Saturday, Sept. 7, the day of the crash, and reopened one lane in each direction on Sunday, the day after the crash.</p>

<p>(Sept. 23, 2019) A new Fixing Our Streets safety project starts construction today, with the installation of a rapid-flashing beacon, upgraded ADA-accessible curb ramps and other safety improvements at NE Sandy Boulevard and 31<span style=""font-size: 11.25px; line-height: 0; position: relative; top: -0.5em;"">st</span>&nbsp;Avenue. This Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) project will make crossing NE Sandy Boulevard&mdash;a high crash corridor&mdash;safer for pedestrians to get to TriMet&rsquo;s frequent-service Line 12 bus stop and to other businesses in the area.</p>
<p>Sandy Boulevard is designated as a&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/54892?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">High Crash Corridor</a>&nbsp;which means there are a high concentration of crashes along it. On Sandy Boulevard, from 2013 to 2017, there have been a total of 759 injury crashes, including: 2 fatalities, 27 serious injuries, and 204 moderate injuries. The intersection of NE Sandy Boulevard and 31st Avenue was first identified for improvement in the&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/483363?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">2014&nbsp;NE Sandy High Crash Corridor Safety Plan</a>.</p>
<p>During construction, we ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all lane detours and directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes if possible.

<p>This project was made possible by Fixing our Streets, a voter-approved 10-cent gas tax for restoring our streets and making them safer.&nbsp;It is the&nbsp;first local funding source in the city&rsquo;s history dedicated exclusively to&nbsp;transportation needs.&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing our Streets</a>&nbsp;projects span across Portland&nbsp;to the benefit of&nbsp;all Portlanders.</p>

<p>The course provides on opportunity to have in-depth conversations with guest lecturers, all transportation leaders from Portland and beyond. This year&rsquo;s lineup includes:&nbsp;<a href=""https://altaplanning.com/people/marisa-demull/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Marisa DeMull</a>&nbsp;(Engineer at Alta Planning + Design),&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.tamikabutler.com/about?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Tamika Butler</a>&nbsp;(Toole Design's Director of Planning for California and the Director of Equity and Inclusion), and&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/499810?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Art Pearce</a>&nbsp;(Manager of Policy, Planning &amp; Projects at PBOT). The new instructor, Thuy Tu, brings with her 20 years of experience as a Senior Transportation Planner and Civil Engineering Project Manager and a strong focus on equity, livability, and resilience.</p>
<p>Community input from people who live, work, and travel on a particular street or corridor is crucial to a transportation project&rsquo;s success. This class will explore ways that community members can influence projects early in the planning stages. Community engagement can take many forms, from open houses and design workshops to advisory committees. Learn how the transportation system is developed and shaped using transportation policy, plans, and community input. Community-based organizations will also be joining the lineup of guest speakers to share their experiences in planning with PBOT and the city.</p>
<p>The Portland Traffic and Transportation Course was created in 1991 by Portland's then-Transportation Commissioner Earl Blumenauer (now U.S. Representative for Oregon's 3rd congressional district) and Rick Gustafson, former Metro Executive Officer and Oregon House Representative.</p>

<p>(Oct. 10, 2019) Designing roads for safety&mdash;especially on major streets known as arterials&mdash;has been a historic challenge for cities across the country. Portland arterials make up just 8% of city streets, but nearly 60% of the city&rsquo;s traffic deaths and serious injuries. That is why the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) places such a high priority on arterials. PBOT knows that reducing speed on these roads, among other improvements, is key to making these streets safer and reducing the likelihood (and severity) of crashes.</p>
<p>Watch a&nbsp;<a href=""https://youtu.be/03Lpn67A6oo?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">new video</a>&nbsp;that shows how we're redesigning streets for the benefit of all Portlanders:</p>
<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/03Lpn67A6oo?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery""><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""width: 590px; height: auto; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2871301/video-screen-shot_original.png"" alt=""Smarter Street screen shot"" width=""590"" height=""369"" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our roads and what's been built up around them&nbsp;has changed significantly&nbsp;over the last half century, but so have people&rsquo;s habits and the transportation options they have. PBOT&rsquo;s new designs for arterials reflect this growth and these changes, ensuring arterials work for everyone, with reconfigured lanes, safer pedestrian crossings, new places for people to bike, and better access to frequent transit service to help all Portlanders get where they need to go safely and efficiently.</p>
<p class=""content-right""><img class=""govd_template_image content-left"" style=""width: 306px; height: auto; float: left; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2874330/2839974/1_crop.jpg"" alt=""SW Capitol Highway Complete Streets"" hspace=""7"" width=""306"" height=""258"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>Recent updates to&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/76617?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">SW Capitol Highway from Huber Street to SW 49th Avenue and Kerr Parkway</a>&nbsp;have already earned praise from community members, including Shawn Garnett, Principal of Markham Elementary School, saying, ""I had some reservations at first, thinking it could end up being a traffic jam nightmare in the mornings and afternoons with all the school buses, pedestrians, and cars. The changes made in front of Markham are the BEST ever for students and everyone else&rsquo;s safety. This has been a LONG time coming, but it has finally come. The changes respect the lives of children and adults. The reduction to two lanes on Capitol Highway in just that small stretch emphasizes the importance of people&rsquo;s safety, especially in front of a school. This makes it so much easier for our safety patrol students to do their jobs and helps me to breathe easier.&nbsp;I could not be happier with the new configuration.""</p>
<p><strong>Disproportionate impact</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another reason PBOT prioritizes safety on arterials is because of who we know is most affected by traffic violence. The following populations all have a disproportionately higher risk of suffering a life-altering injury on Portland streets:</p>
<ul>
<li>People of color</li>
<li>People with lower incomes</li>
<li>Pedestrians and people biking</li>
<li>People living east of 82nd Avenue</li>
<li>School-aged children</li>
<li>Adults over the age of 65</li>
</ul>
<p>Our city policies guide us to ensure all Portlanders have access to safe streets and that no single group is disproportionately impacted by traffic violence. A life-altering injury or fatality every other month is simply unacceptable. No one wants to come home to news that a family member was rushed to the hospital due to a car crash.</p>

<p><strong>East Portland Arterial Street Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Based on the feedback of Portland residents, PBOT has launched an initiative called the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/78008?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">East Portland Arterial Street Strategy</a>. With this initiative, PBOT is seeking a holistic approach to making East Portland arterial streets safer while also planning for the travel demands of the future.</p>
<p>This means that each arterial may require a different approach or design. Reconfiguring lanes, as we have done on corridors like SE Foster Road and NE Glisan Street, is one of many tools in PBOT&rsquo;s toolbox to improve safety, but it may not be the right fit for every arterial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage your feedback on these and other initiatives as we continue to work on making East Portland safer. Thank you for your suggestions.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/744138

<p class=""content-center""><img class=""govd_template_image content-left"" style=""width: 260px; height: auto; float: left; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2874272/2839935/greeley_crop.png"" alt=""Greeley project map"" hspace=""7"" width=""260"" height=""400"" align=""left"" /></p>
<p>N Greeley Avenue is a busy, high-speed road with heavy freight vehicle traffic. On Greeley, there are 25,000 motor vehicle trips per day and 15% of them are trucks; some vehicles travel at speeds of up to 60 mph. The street&nbsp; also carries distinct classifications as a Major City Bikeway&mdash;providing a direct bicycle connection between St. Johns and the central city&mdash;a Priority Truck Street, and a City Walkway.</p>
<p>""We know that protected bike lanes are safer for people biking and driving&rdquo; said Alex Zimmerman, co-chair of the Portland&rsquo;s Bicycle Advisory Committee. &ldquo;N Greeley is an important link in our bikeway network, and this project will benefit everyone using the corridor while protecting some of our most vulnerable road users.""</p>
<p>The installation of a protected multiuse path is expected to reduce bike crashes. The roadside barriers will also reduce the severity of crashes and prevent run off the road crashes.</p>
<p>When the work is complete in early 2020, the new street configuration will look like this:</p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""width: 590px; height: auto; border-style: none;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2874275/2839936/greeley-cross-section_crop.png"" alt=""Greeley cross-section"" width=""590"" height=""169"" /></p>
<h2><strong>Lane reductions and bike detours during construction</strong></h2>
<p>During construction, incremental lane closures will be required along N Greeley Avenue. PBOT traffic engineers will monitor traffic in the area closely and make adjustments to the traffic control plan as necessary to accommodate freight and other traffic accessing Swan Island. This is critical because of the lane closures on the N Going Street Bridge following the Union Pacific train derailment last month.</p>

<p>People biking are asked to use the designated bicycle detour on N Interstate Avenue and Willamette Boulevard during construction. The detour is expected to remain in place for the duration of construction, which is estimated to be completed by late-winter, early-spring 2020.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">PBOT engineers and contractors are planning on how they can open a fourth lane on the bridge, which would allow two lanes on and off the island in each direction at all times. PBOT is working with Union Pacific to schedule times when the railroad can be shut down to allow access for bridge repairs.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">PBOT has submitted a variety of work plans and schedules that could complete the work. PBOT's contractor has agreed to work at night to expedite opening a fourth lane, and while we are hoping to have the lane open as soon as possible, it could take several months because of limited access to the work zone beneath the bridge.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">PBOT has also submitted a work plan that could open a fourth lane in a matter of weeks. Union Pacific is reviewing that plan.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Traffic signal adjusted for eastbound traffic congestion</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">People who work on Swan Island say that traffic congestion leaving the island continues to be a significant disruption. In the days after the Sept. 7 derailment, crews adjusted traffic signals. Last week,&nbsp;PBOT traffic engineers also adjusted the traffic signal at the intersection of N Going Street and N Port Center Way, the last signal travelers reach before they enter the bridge. The adjustments increased the ""green time"" for eastbound traffic by more than 30 percent, giving more time for eastbound travelers.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">After the adjustment, PBOT staff measured the time it takes to travel from where the N Anchor Street ramp enters N Channel Avenue, to the point where N Channel Avenue passes under the N Greeley Avenue Bridge. At 11 a.m., without traffic congestion, the average travel time was 1 minute and 7 seconds.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Using&nbsp;the worst set of travel times, the average peak travel time was about 4 minutes longer than non-peak.&nbsp; We did have one trip that was an increase of almost 9 minutes longer, for a trip of about 10 minutes long.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">PBOT engineers will continue to look for ways to reduce traffic delays during the lane closures.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Return to six lanes potentially this spring</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Planning for permanent repairs to the bridge, including planning for access to Union Pacific's property during construction, is on-going. Permanent repairs would&nbsp;return the bridge to its full three lanes each direction.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Permanent repairs, which would open six total lanes, could potentially be completed this spring.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Reversible lane too risky, unsafe</span></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">Initial repairs by PBOT crews made the bridge safe enough that the bureau was able to open a third travel lane on Sunday Sept. 15, allowing two lanes for westbound travel to Swan Island, with one lane available for eastbound travel. People who work on Swan Island say that traffic congestion leaving the island continues to be a significant disruption.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 3.75pt;""><span style=""font-size: 11.5pt;"">PBOT traffic engineers studied the feasibility of&nbsp;reversing the direction of one of the two westbound travel lanes, to offer two lanes eastbound direction, coming off the island, in the afternoon and evening. That option was determined to be unsafe. To use a concrete barrier to separate traffic would require obtaining specialized machinery that is not available in the region. Using cones and other plastic materials would pose safety risks as those materials could be displaced or blown over by traffic, blocking travel lanes. Moving plastic materials twice a day also exposes city crews or contractors to safety risks during the most hazardous time of a road closure: the time when they make adjustments to the equipment at the scene.</span></p>

<p>(Oct. 15, 2019) Throughout Portland, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is installing new high-visibility crosswalks to heighten safety and visibility for pedestrians.</p>
<p>With a new directive from the city&rsquo;s traffic engineer, these high-visibility markings are the new standard for marked crossings in Portland. This is one of the first actions PBOT has taken since Portland City Council adopted a new pedestrian master plan, known as&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.pedpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">PedPDX</a>, this past June.</p>
<p><strong>What are high-visibility crosswalks and how are they different?</strong></p>
<p>High-visibility crosswalks (sometimes called &ldquo;continental-style&rdquo; crosswalks) have thick lines parallel to traffic flow that allow drivers to see the crosswalk from further away. This gives drivers more time to stop safely for pedestrians crossing, or waiting to cross.</p>
<p>As new crosswalks are installed or reinstalled by PBOT crews and contractors, they will include these new high-visibility markings. Where an existing crosswalk already exists, such as the type with two white lines perpendicular to traffic, you will see PBOT adding high-visibility markings into the existing striping.</p>
<p><a style=""color: #1d5782; text-decoration-line: underline; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400;"" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://youtu.be/03Lpn67A6oo?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank""><img class=""govd_template_image"" style=""border-style: none; width: 590px; height: auto;"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2881555/2843935/2_crop.png"" alt=""A high-visibility crosswalk at SE 30th Avenue and Hawthorne Boulevard"" width=""590"" height=""437"" /></a></p>

New left turn calming rubber speed bumps were also added as part of PBOT's Vision Zero left turn calming pilot. Photo by PBOT.</p>
<p><strong>Why the focus on crossings?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""govd_template_image"" src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/10/2881526/2843936/3_crop.png"" alt=""ped crashes at signals"" hspace=""7"" width=""387"" height=""176"" align=""right"" /></p>
<p>The data collected for PedPDX found that over 40% of pedestrian crashes and 30% of severe and fatal crashes citywide occur at intersections with traffic signals. Over a quarter of all crashes involve a turning driver failing to yield when the pedestrian has the right of way.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding high-visibility crosswalks at intersections with traffic signals may help make pedestrians more visible to people driving. PBOT will install these high-visibility crosswalks at intersections with traffic signals and all other marked crossings moving forward. This data-driven approach to solving traffic safety issues is a core tenet of Vision Zero.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Oct. 28, 2019)&nbsp;The&nbsp;Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) has received approval from Union Pacific Railroad to begin work Nov. 4 on repairs that could allow the bureau to reopen a fourth lane on the North Going Street Bridge before the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>This would help relieve congestion in a crucial freight corridor before the busy holiday shipping season.</p>
<p>A Union Pacific Railroad derailment on Saturday, Sept. 7 damaged columns that support the bridge, leading PBOT to initially close the bridge entirely, and gradually reopen lanes. Since Sept. 15, three lanes have been open, down from the normal six lanes. The bridge provides the only public access to the Swan Island industrial area, home to about 200 businesses and more than 12,000 jobs. Daimler, UPS and FedEx all have large operations there, generating significant freight traffic for time-sensitive deliveries.</p>
<p>Initial repairs by PBOT crews made the bridge safe enough to open a third travel lane on Sunday Sept. 15, allowing two lanes for westbound travel to Swan Island, with one lane available for eastbound travel.</p>
<p>People who work on Swan Island say that traffic congestion leaving the island continues to be a significant disruption. Numerous businesses have changed work schedules for hundreds of employees to avoid rush-hour congestion. Deliveries have been delayed. People have reported road range incidents and car crashes.</p>
<p>Travel times off the island have been reported to vary widely and unpredictably in the afternoon and early evening hours.</p>
<p>PBOT engineers will continue to look for ways to reduce traffic delays during the lane closures.</p>
<p><strong>Return to six lanes potentially this spring</strong></p>
<p>Planning for permanent repairs to the bridge, including planning for access to Union Pacific's property during construction, is on-going. Permanent repairs would&nbsp;return the bridge to its full three lanes each direction.</p>
<p>Permanent repairs, which would open six total lanes, could potentially be completed this spring.</p>
<p><strong>Stay tuned for further updates</strong></p>
<p>We will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.</p>

News,746763,"News Release: NE 47th Avenue, one of Portland’s most deteriorated streets, is getting an upgrade",1,,2019-11-08 18:22:41 UTC,2019-11-05 18:18:00 UTC,A,"The improvements are the result of a partnership between PBOT, Portland Parks & Recreation, the Portland Water Bureau, the Bureau of Environmental Services, and adjacent property owners.","<p><span class=""normaltextrun"">(Nov. 5, 2019) The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) has started work on the NE 47th Avenue Phase 1 Local Improvement District (LID) from north of Columbia Boulevard to south of&nbsp;</span><span class=""spellingerror"">Cornfoot</span><span class=""normaltextrun"">&nbsp;Road.This is one of Portland&rsquo;s most deteriorated road segments in the city. PBOT-contracted crews will completely reconstruct the road and add multiuse paths on both sides of the street for pedestrians and people biking. PBOT has partnered with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the Portland Water Bureau, the Bureau of Environmental Services, and adjacent property owners, to make this project a reality.</span></p>

This is also a priority trucking route, a busy thoroughfare that sees high traffic volume and speeds. These factors, combined with the lack of physical separation of the road from pedestrians and bicyclists, makes it unsafe for everyone.</p>
<p>This road is also a key access point for Portland&rsquo;s Whitaker Ponds Nature Park, an educational site that provides nature-based recreation. Currently, pedestrians trying to access Whitaker must make an uncomfortable, risky journey from TriMet&rsquo;s frequent service line 75, and must share the fog line with large trucks delivering goods to the region, including the nearby new U.S. Postal Service facility and the Columbia Corridor industrial area. NE 47th Avenue needed a makeover, which is why Portland City Council approved formation of this LID.</p>
<p>In addition to repaving and multiuse paths, the NE 47th Avenue LID will extend stormwater and sanitary sewers to help protect the Columbia Slough. Taking advantage of the road being torn up, crews will also replace the century-old cast-iron water main with a new ductile iron water main to meet current engineering standards. Contractors will install new street lighting, and rapid-flashing beacons at the southern edge of Whitaker Ponds Nature Park to help people safely cross NE 47th Avenue.</p>
<p><img src=""https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/ORPORTLAND/2019/11/2935144/2867812/160614-section-atpark_crop.jpg"" alt=""Sketch of 47th Ave improvements"" /></p>

<p>In addition to all these physical safety improvements, this project will also fulfill PBOT&rsquo;s equity objectives by investing directly in underserved communities. The Cully neighborhood is home to one of the most diverse communities in Portland. Cully not only has less road, sidewalk, and stormwater infrastructure than your average Portland neighborhood, they also have more households in poverty, and more youth. The NE 47th Avenue LID, among other&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/76896?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">projects</a>, is a push by PBOT to increase safety, provide more access, and more travel options for everyone in this vibrant neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have worked near NE 47th for 25 years. I have seen the struggle of people walking from my office at the far north end to try to catch the bus at the far south end,&rdquo; said Mark Hatten, one of the property owners funding this project. &ldquo;I'm really looking forward to the bike lanes, the new sidewalks, and the bioswale green spaces, it will be so worth it. It will make such an improvement to the neighborhood... Visually it will be more pleasing, there will be more green space, no more parking junk cars along 47th. It's going to be great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;PBOT is excited to collaborate with other city bureaus and property owners to transform NE 47th Avenue,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;I am particularly proud that this work helps us fulfill our equity objectives, by making investments in the historically underserved Cully neighborhood as well as improving pedestrian safety and access to transit for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is proud to work alongside other city partners to provide safer access to&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?PropertyID=856&amp;action=ViewPark&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Whitaker Ponds Nature Park</span>&nbsp;</a>with new sidewalks and designated bike lanes,&rdquo; said Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;We are excited to see the project moving forward as Portland works together to increase safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to collaborate to get essential underground infrastructure built all at once. That maximizes the efficiency of sewer and stormwater installations while minimizing the need for future disruptions to the road,&rdquo; said Dawn Uchiyama, Environmental Services&rsquo; deputy director. &ldquo;Plus, above ground, we are&nbsp;excited to install&nbsp;more than 20 green street&nbsp;planters, or bioswales, to filter and clean stormwater naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this work, the Portland Water Bureau will&nbsp;move more than 2,000 feet of water main (pipe) and three existing hydrants for this project, install four new hydrants, and conduct work on&nbsp;water service lines under the proposed stormwater planters</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to overlook the work that goes on underground simply because it&rsquo;s out of sight. But this project highlights the important role each bureau plays in sustaining and improving livability for our Portland communities,&rdquo; said Water Bureau Director Michael Stuhr. &ldquo;Our water keeps Portland green, clean and hydrated. We also keep you safe by maintaining the hydrants our firefighters use in emergencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NE 47th Avenue LID&rsquo;s total budget is $7.7 million, funded through PBOT System Development Charges ($4.2 million), the Local Improvement District funding from property owners ($165,571), as well as contributions from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation ($1 million), the Bureau of Environmental Services ($1.4 million), and the Portland Water Bureau ($900,000).</p>
<p>Initial work is already underway and the entire NE 47th Avenue LID project should be completed by late summer, early fall 2020.

<p class=""gdp"">For decades, the bureau has collected leaves and swept streets in designated Leaf Districts, locations that account for the vast majority of leaves that fall on city streets. In 2010, the bureau started charging a fee for the service to recover the city's costs during the Great Recession. The fee never covered the cost of the service, and was discontinued in 2018.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">Leaf Day, leaf removal is funded through general transportation dollars, much like other services such as snow and ice removal, pothole repairs and roadside vegetation clean-up.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">PBOT crews sweep all residential streets once a year, and in areas with the most street trees, their annual sweep is during their Leaf Day service. PBOT also sweeps the city's major arterial streets three to four times a year -- at night, when there is less traffic and fewer parked cars and other obstructions.</p>
<h1 class=""content-center""><strong>Leaves create slick hazards, clog storm drains</strong></h1>
<p class=""gdp"">Portland's tree canopy covers a significant portion of the city. In autumn, wet fallen leaves can become very slick, creating potential hazards for people walking, biking, rolling or driving through tree-lined neighborhoods. Leaves can also clog storm drains and thus contribute to street flooding during heavy fall rains. To help address these hazards, city crews have been removing thousands of cubic yards of leaves from Portland streets for more than three decades.</p>
<p class=""gdp"">For the most part, Leaf Day service will be the same as years past. Starting Nov. 7, PBOT crews will remove leaves in 52 leaf districts across the city. Residents in the leaf districts should move their cars and other obstacles from the street and limb their street trees to clear the way for large trucks prior to their Leaf Day service to facilitate a more effective clean-up.</p>
<p>Moving your vehicle is NOT OPTIONAL in the following Leaf Day districts, where residents have asked us for many years to tow vehicles because of the high number of cars parked on Leaf Day:</p>

In January 2019, PBOT retained HP Civil Inc., an Oregon-based construction company, as general contractor for the project. The project includes 32% participation from Disadvantaged, Minority-Owned, Women-Owned, Emerging Small Businesses, or Service Disabled Veterans Business Enterprises (D/M/W/ESB/SDVBE) including an equity partner, West Side Iron, a minority-owned Oregon business responsible for delivering and assembling the bridge structure.

News,747312,News Release: Downtown SmartPark all-day rates to change on Nov. 18th,1,,2019-11-18 19:09:24 UTC,2019-11-08 19:08:00 UTC,A,"New rates to encourage more turnover in garages designed for short-term needs of downtown shoppers, visitors, and business clients.  Short-term parking rates will remain the same.","<p>(Nov. 8, 2019) Today, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) announced that all-day rates in the five city-owned SmartPark garages will go up, starting Monday, Nov. 18. The rates will rise by two dollars a day, ranging from $16/day in the 10th and Yamhill garage to $20/day at the 1st and Jefferson garage. The change will only apply to customers who enter a garage between 5 a.m. and 4:59 p.m. and stay for more than four hours. Rates for people parking up to four hours will stay the same as will evening rates which begin at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>SmartPark garages provide important support for downtown Portland's business, commercial and cultural activity. They are designed to provide short-term parking for shoppers, tourists, and business clients. To ensure that these downtown visitors can easily find parking, PBOT aims for an 85% occupancy rate in each garage. Recently, occupancy rates in the five garages have all been over the 85% threshold with occupancy in the 1st and Jefferson garage approaching 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By raising the rates for long-term parking, but keeping them the same for short-term parking, PBOT hopes to increase the available spaces for people visiting, shopping and conducting business in downtown. Making more spaces available is particularly important in the coming weeks as the holiday shopping season kicks into high gear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SmartPark short-term rates are among the lowest in the Central City and the SmartPark garages are conveniently located near popular culinary, commercial and cultural destinations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT&nbsp;encourages anyone who needs long term parking, particularly employees who work downtown, to look to private garages for their parking needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new rates were developed with input from key Central City stakeholders, including the Portland Business Alliance and the Downtown Retail Council.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the current and new rates in all five SmartPark garages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the event this morning was Edwin Skaug of <a href=""http://www.aconvenientcycle.com"" target=""_blank"">A Convenient Cycle</a>. Edwin re-assembled a used fixed gear Dutch cargo bike and transformed it into a mobile bike repair shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Convenient Cycle is usually hitched at SE 11th/Clay along with a bevy of tasty food carts. Edwin is also at different Portland events for if your steed needs some love, keep an eye for Edwin and his mobile cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Convenient Cycle also has a bike shop in the Active Space building at 833 SE Main.</p>

News,312586,Turn signals rock,1,,2019-11-09 00:38:53 UTC,2019-11-09 00:38:53 UTC,A,Show us what you're thinking,"<p><img style=""border: 1px solid black; float: left; margin: 5px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=312587"" alt="""" width=""320"" height=""214"" />You want to share the love whether you are driving or biking? Use those turn signals!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the Bicycle Transportation Alliance coined the term 'Hand Signals Rock' and I would like to extend it to turn signals for autombolies as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turns signals tell us what our fellow road users plan to do before they do it. Turn signals help drivers not hit other road users they don't see because they give the other user a chance to prepare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Hand) turn signals are an important part of bicycling safely. They help prevent you from crashing into other cyclists and from getting hit by oncoming cars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we get on the road or trail, we rely on each other for a safe trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn signals and hand signals are an expression of citizenship. If you love freedom, shows us your signal.<img style=""margin: 5px; float: right; border: black 1px solid;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=312588"" alt="""" width=""306"" height=""229"" /></p>

<p class=""gdcaption""><em>Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;In advance of the expected severe winter weather, I encourage everyone to focus on clearing your sidewalks,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;Remember that we are all a part of one community and that your neighbors may need your help. Elderly Portlanders and Portlanders with disabilities are particularly vulnerable during winter storms&mdash;please consider checking in with your neighbors and offering to clear sidewalks for those who need assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to winter weather, PBOT&rsquo;s mission is to help everyone get home safe,&rdquo; said Chris Warner, Director of PBOT. &ldquo;We have been getting Winter Ready. We also need the public to be winter ready. If there&rsquo;s snow and ice the forecast, telecommute if you can. If you need to travel, use public transit as a first option. If you plan to drive, plan ahead. Match your driving conditions with the weather conditions. With caution and common sense, we really can all get home safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever winter throws at us this year, we&rsquo;ll be ready,&rdquo; said Ted Miller, ODOT&rsquo;s maintenance and operations manager for the Portland area. &ldquo;Our tools include salt but like all of our tools, it&rsquo;s not a perfect solution to all winter problems. And remember, we all play a part in making sure the roads operate smoothly in winter storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;TriMet works with other transportation agencies to keep transit moving each day, but that partnership is never more urgent than during wintry weather,&rdquo; said TriMet Chief Operating Officer Sam Desue, Jr. &ldquo;We have stocked up on chains and readied our equipment, and we ask riders to prepare as well. Check out our winter riding tips at <a href=""https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMTMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAxOTExMjIuMTMyMzczMjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3RyaW1ldC5vcmcvYWxlcnRzL3dpbnRlcndlYXRoZXIuaHRtP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSJ9.5HKOWQSKbG5Nl1uqxdhsem_D-vbGu7EGW7LI5nl1pJY/br/71749226834-l"">trimet.org</a>, and when the snow or ice begins to fall, know that we at TriMet, as well as our partners, will do all we can to keep you moving safely.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our crews are ready for winter and work hard to keep roads clear, but as last winter showed, when severe weather comes through we all experience it which is why we need the public&rsquo;s help,&rdquo; said WSDOT Highway Maintenance Supervisor, Patricia Cummins. &ldquo;For the safety of the traveling public, please be sure to clear snow off your car before you hit the road. It improves the drivers visibility and it reduces the chances of snow flying off and hitting other travelers. We also want to remind all users of the road if you must drive, drive for the conditions and to their comfort level. Most collisions are due to spin outs or because vehicles are traveling too fast on icy roads. Prepare early and stay informed about road conditions and restrictions. These small steps can make a big difference in helping to keep traffic moving during storms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-TRAN is prepared for whatever winter may bring this year,"" said Christine Selk, spokesperson for C-TRAN, the Clark County transit agency. ""Our Operations, Maintenance and Communication teams are committed to keeping passengers safe and informed.

<p>(Nov. 27, 2019) In Portland we are rightly proud of our local breweries, wineries, and distilleries.</p>
<p>But we should not be proud of continued serious crashes involving alcohol. Nearly half of Portland traffic deaths from 2013 through 2017 involved alcohol impairment (see chart). An additional 192 people suffered serious injuries, such as brain damage or paralysis, as a result of alcohol-involved crashes during the same period.</p>

<p>People not hurt in a crash may still face license suspension, job loss, higher insurance costs, court fees, or jail time. Crash survivors may also face depression or other mental health issues.</p>
<p>While substances other than alcohol can also increase the risk of crashing, research indicates that alcohol&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3893634/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">has the biggest impact on deadly crash risk</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How many drinks are safe before driving?</strong></p>
<p>It is best to avoid driving after drinking alcohol. Even one drink&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">can make it harder</a>&nbsp;for people to visually track moving targets and to perform two tasks at the same time, both of which are important for driving. By the time a person hits Oregon&rsquo;s legal BAC limit they are&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/nti/pdf/812117-Drug_and_Alcohol_Crash_Risk.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">three times</a>&nbsp;more likely to crash compared to a sober person.</p>
<p>Translating a specific number of drinks into BAC levels is difficult. BAC for a given number of drinks depends on factors including height, weight, gender, a person&rsquo;s liver function, and the strength of the drinks.</p>
<p>The effects of even low levels of alcohol on driving have led Utah and many countries to adopt BAC limits lower than 0.08. Countries including Brazil have made it illegal to have any measurable alcohol in the blood of people driving (see map).

<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do your best to avoid driving after drinking alcohol.&nbsp;</strong>Public transit, taxis, and ridehailing services are good alternatives to driving. If you are drinking around a holiday or big event, check for ridehailing and taxi discounts through&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""/transportation/76611?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">PBOT&rsquo;s Safe Ride Home program</a>.</li>
<li><strong>If you are drinking with a group,&nbsp;</strong>help others travel in ways other than driving themselves. Intervening to prevent others from driving after drinking can be a&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9065897?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">powerful way to prevent serious crashes</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Overnight parking&nbsp;</strong>is allowed at most&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""/transportation/article/113927?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">public SmartPark garages</a>&nbsp;and on many Portland streets. A parking ticket is also much cheaper than a crash.</li>
<li><strong>Parents and guardians</strong>&nbsp;can&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=preventing-impaired-driving-in-your-teen-160-47&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"" data-auth=""NotApplicable"">help their children make safe choices</a>&nbsp;by teaching them not to drink and drive or to ride with anyone who has been drinking.</li>

<p>(Dec. 6, 2019)&nbsp;Back in&nbsp;September 2017, construction began on SW Main Street&nbsp;between&nbsp;First&nbsp;and&nbsp;Third&nbsp;avenues, providing&nbsp;a&nbsp;much-needed&nbsp;facelift.&nbsp;This section of roadway&nbsp;was failing&nbsp;many&nbsp;modes of transportation. At that&nbsp;time, this street&nbsp;was cracked, sagging,&nbsp;and&nbsp;had&nbsp;sizeable potholes that posed a serious threat to&nbsp;pedestrians and cyclists alike.&nbsp;People biking&nbsp;using&nbsp;the Hawthorne&nbsp;Bridge&nbsp;to enter&nbsp;downtown&mdash;one of the busiest bike routes in North America&mdash;had&nbsp;to dart, swerve, and dodge potholes&nbsp;just&nbsp;to pass through this section of road.&nbsp;Worsening an already precarious situation, the&nbsp;street&nbsp;striping&nbsp;forced&nbsp;bus and bicycle traffic&nbsp;to&nbsp;engage in a&nbsp;dangerous&nbsp;act of&nbsp;weaving&nbsp;amongst each other&nbsp;in the middle of the intersection.&nbsp;The street&nbsp;was&nbsp;in&nbsp;dire need&nbsp;of&nbsp;improvements.</p>
<div>
<p>Improvements for&nbsp;SW Main Street, funded by Fixing Our Streets,&nbsp;included&nbsp;replacing&nbsp;the base underneath the road&nbsp;surface&nbsp;and&nbsp;paving the street to extend&nbsp;its lifespan by 15 to 20 years.&nbsp;A&nbsp;concrete bus pad&nbsp;was&nbsp;also&nbsp;added at the&nbsp;bus&nbsp;stop.&nbsp;Concrete&nbsp;is a better material for&nbsp;bus stops because the weight and heat generated by&nbsp;stopped&nbsp;buses can&nbsp;create wheel ruts in asphalt, while concrete is stronger&nbsp;and can hold up for longer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The&nbsp;new&nbsp;street striping design&nbsp;added&nbsp;a bike box to increase visibility of people on bicycles&nbsp;coming off the Hawthorne Bridge&nbsp;at SW Main&nbsp;Street&nbsp;and First Avenue. It&nbsp;also added&nbsp;green&nbsp;paint&nbsp;to&nbsp;bike lanes,&nbsp;as well as areas where bike traffic and vehicle traffic intersect.&nbsp;The city added smaller green boxes&mdash;called &ldquo;turn queue boxes&rdquo;&mdash;to make it easier for people bicycling to turn. People bicycling can use these boxes as part of a two-stage turn and not have to merge across travel lanes. Sometimes called a &ldquo;Copenhagen Left&rdquo; this move is sometimes&nbsp;referred to locally as&nbsp;the &ldquo;Portland Pivot.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Checking in on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;morning commute,&nbsp;it was&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;apparent why&nbsp;SW Main&nbsp;Street is a key entrance into downtown Portland.&nbsp;Filling the sidewalk, pedestrians&nbsp;were&nbsp;swiftly moving while&nbsp;guzzling down&nbsp;their&nbsp;morning&nbsp;coffees.&nbsp;People biking&nbsp;whizzed by&nbsp;in the new lane, with&nbsp;scores pouring&nbsp;into downtown,&nbsp;resembling&nbsp;something akin to a locomotive train.&nbsp;Adding&nbsp;to the flurry of activity, buses entered&nbsp;at a&nbsp;steady rate&nbsp;delivering people to their destinations. Remarkably,&nbsp;thanks to the&nbsp;striping&nbsp;and road work, these different modes of transportation&nbsp;interacted&nbsp;seamlessly and safely.&nbsp;This interaction&nbsp;conjured&nbsp;up&nbsp;images&nbsp;of an&nbsp;opera, with various&nbsp;instruments&nbsp;(or modes)&nbsp;interacting with&nbsp;one&nbsp;another in&nbsp;impeccable&nbsp;form. This stood in stark contrast to&nbsp;the former reality of SW Main&nbsp;Street, where&nbsp;various&nbsp;modes of transportation&nbsp;had to&nbsp;dangerously weave&nbsp;amongst one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;appreciate the bike box at the intersection of&nbsp;First&nbsp;and Main,&rdquo;&nbsp;said&nbsp;one person biking by&nbsp;on&nbsp;their&nbsp;commute, &ldquo;It makes me much more visible, putting me directly in the driver&rsquo;s vision.&rdquo;</p>
<div>
<p>Funding for SW Main Street&nbsp;came from Fixing&nbsp;Our Streets,&nbsp;also&nbsp;known as Measure 26-173, a 10-cent gas tax voters&nbsp;approved&nbsp;in May 2016&nbsp;to&nbsp;rebuild our&nbsp;roads&nbsp;and make&nbsp;them safer. This was the first local funding source in the city&rsquo;s history dedicated exclusively to the city&rsquo;s transportation needs. Fixing&nbsp;Our Streets projects span across all of Portland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The request started with PBOT's 503-823-SAFE (7233)&nbsp;traffic safety and livability hotline, which has <a href=""https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAxOTEyMTEuMTQxNzg0NDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb3J0bGFuZG9yZWdvbi5nb3YvdHJhbnNwb3J0YXRpb24vaW5kZXguY2ZtP0NGSUQ9MTc4NzE3NDg4JkNGVE9LRU49MWE2ZGUyMWVhNDU1MTBhYy03NjY1QjAyMi1DOUQyLTMzMDctQjVCNDY4RDk1RjQ4QzQ3RiZjPTc5Mzg5JmxvZ2luPTEmc2hvd19tZXNzYWdlPTEmdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5In0.xIqOmaHfs2ixT_bSas69K4B0C1-aFzYHgAb4DwUesIU/br/72730699918-l"" target=""_blank"">a convenient online form for public requests</a>.</p>
<p>The neighborhood association worked with PBOT to design a traffic improvement plan that would reduce cut-through traffic in the Lair Hill neighborhood within South Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""As young families with children have moved into Lair Hill, in context of more pedestrians and bicyclists, street safety became a major priority,"" said Michael Kaplan, SPNA interim president. ""Our neighborhood association is grateful to build a partnership with PBOT that could help improve the livability of our area. Access to the Ross Island Bridge will be maintained via other streets, without the attendant hazards to residents of Lair Hill. And important regional traffic will enjoy access to regional traffic corridors, which is consistent with overall planning by PBOT, and maintaining a livable city.""</p>
<p>The project aims to reduce traffic on narrow streets designed for local traffic. SW Gibbs Street west of Water Avenue has 1,500 car trips a day, including 633 trips westbound from 4 to 6 p.m. on weekdays<span class=""normaltextrun"">, according to traffic counts from February</span>. By comparison, most local residential streets have 500 to 1,000 cars a day.</p>
<p><span class=""normaltextrun"">SW Kelly Avenue has more than 4,700 daily trips. The project will eliminate the northbound traffic on SW Kelly north of SW Curry, reducing trips by 1,553 trips a day, or about 32 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class=""normaltextrun"">PBOT maintenance crews are scheduled to install barricades in the streets on Monday and post signs in the area. Warning signs have been posted in the area since Dec. 3. PBOT will gather data on traffic and speeding in the coming weeks and months and evaluate the project.</span></p>

<p>(Dec. 20, 2019) With the&nbsp;<a rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.saferfoster.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project</a>&nbsp;in Southeast Portland, PBOT transformed nearly 40 city blocks from an unsafe, high-crash corridor to a walkable and bikeable commercial main street for Portlanders of all ages to enjoy. The project extended from SE 50th Avenue to the western edge of the Lents Town Center at SE 90th Avenue. Most noticeably, PBOT changed the design of the street, transforming SE Foster Road from a high-speed, auto-oriented corridor into a safer, more balanced street for pedestrians as well as people biking, taking transit, and driving. This new design supports a growing mix of businesses and residences in the neighborhood.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At the ribbon cutting ceremony in early June, Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, PBOT Director Chris Warner, and businesses and neighborhood representatives spoke directly to the positive impact these street improvements were already having and would continue to have heading into summer and fall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a street that will support a vibrant commercial district, that will add to the quality of life in this neighborhood, and that people &ndash; whether they are walking, biking, rolling or driving &ndash; will want to use every day,&rdquo; said Director Warner. &ldquo;To me, that is the power of what we do. We don&rsquo;t just make Portland a better place to get around, we make it a better place to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shea Flaherty Betin, director of the Portland Mercado, said at the ribbon cutting this past summer, ""As we celebrate our new streetscape on Foster, we celebrate the potential for equitable neighborhood growth, we envision increased economic opportunity along Foster for small businesses, for POC entrepreneurs, and for the thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem we have here at the Mercado. I&rsquo;m excited to see more families biking to our massive festivals and events, or to see more folks walking on our new sidewalks to grab an empanada, or some coffee, or a sangria in the evening.""</p>

<p>Today SE Foster Road is a bustling center of activity, with people walking, rolling, biking, and running safely through the corridor. This past week, we saw Portlanders biking and skateboarding over to the Portland Mercado, undoubtedly attracted by the smells of delicious Latin American dishes wafting from the vibrantly colored food carts.</p>
<p>Further down Foster, safely pedaling down Foster&rsquo;s new bike lanes, people were taking a nice afternoon ride. Nearby, a couple of Portland elders were using a redesigned crosswalk to safely cross Foster to access Laurelwood Park. We hope the redesigned street continues to raise the quality of life for residents and businesses in these simple ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;More neighbors are walking to support local businesses now that SE Foster is safer and easier to cross.&nbsp; We know that the positive effects of the Streetscape will be enjoyed for years to come."" Eric Furlong, Chair of the Foster-Powell Neighborhood Association</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a recent PBOT survey, when asked &ldquo;Have you been walking, biking, or accessing transit more on Foster Road?&rdquo; roughly 66% of respondents said &ldquo;they have, and they&rsquo;re excited to do more of it.&rdquo; In a separate survey, a majority of respondents agreed they could access businesses on Foster more easily now and that they were more likely to walk, bike, or take transit on or through Foster Road. In the same survey, 74% of respondents also reported feeling very safe or somewhat safe getting around on Foster Road.</p>
<p>""Since the completion of the streetscape project we've seen a great increase in pedestrian and cycling traffic on Foster, making it easier for customers to visit our district&rdquo;, said Allen Rowand, president of the Foster Area Business Association.""Many have commented that the new crosswalks and bike lanes make them more likely to come to Foster as they can travel safely. The lowered speed limit not only increases safety for those on foot and cyclists, but makes it easier to enter and exit parking spaces along the road. The streetscape has made our businesses more accessible to customers and has contributed toward our goal of making Foster a destination for people throughout Portland.""</p>

<p>Funding for the $9 million Foster Transportation and Streetscape Project came from Fixing Our Streets as well as the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal&nbsp;District, city Transportation System Development Charges,&nbsp;and a federal grant.</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets, otherwise known as Measure 26-173, was a voter-approved four-year 10-cent gas tax for restoring our streets and making them safer. When this measure passed in May 2016, it became the first local funding source in the city&rsquo;s history dedicated exclusively to the city&rsquo;s transportation needs. Fixing Our Streets projects span across all of Portland.</p>

The program started April 26 and was scheduled to end April 26, 2020.</span></p>
<p>The extension will provide more time to thoroughly study the impacts of e-scooters on the transportation system to inform decisions about whether and how e-scooters should continue to be allowed in Portland. This will give PBOT more time to share findings with the public and solicit feedback from Portlanders. The extension will also afford more time to test innovative ways to further improve the program.</p>
<p>""E-scooters have the potential to provide a convenient, climate-friendly transportation option for thousands of Portlanders, but safety is my top priority,"" Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said. ""We heard from Portlanders that riding on sidewalks and irresponsible parking were the most prevalent problems with the 2018 e-scooter pilot program&mdash;while I am pleased that we took action to address this issue with our safe scooting awareness campaign, I remain committed to preserving sidewalk access vital to the well-being of seniors and people with disabilities. I intend to monitor this pilot extension closely to ensure that e-scooters are used safely and responsibly in our shared public right-of-way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a longer pilot program, PBOT staff will be able to continue to explore a variety of issues raised by this new technology, including:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>How Portlanders might be using e-scooters in ways that ease congestion and reduce carbon emissions;</li>
<li>How e-scooters can best meet the transportation needs of historically underserved communities, particularly people of color and people living on low incomes;</li>
<li>How rider education campaigns and continued enforcement can promote safer e-scooter riding;</li>
<li>How macro-economic factors, like competition, mergers and acquisitions, and market volatility, may impact local operators.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the extension, the six companies currently permitted by PBOT will have the ability to continue to operate in Portland until Dec. 31, 2020. The companies include Bird, Bolt, Lime, Razor, Shared and Spin. During this extension, PBOT will not issue permits to additional companies.</p>

<p>PBOT will update its Administrative Rules governing the Shared Electric Scooter Pilot Program in spring 2020 to accommodate this extension. PBOT may make additional changes to its regulatory requirements to apply lessons learned and further improve the program.</p>
<p>PBOT is announcing this extension now because local operators seek to provide stability for their employees and enable planning for the future. During the summer, the six e-scooter companies employed more than 50 full-time and more than one hundred part-time workers in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""content-center"">E-scooter trends emerging in 2019</h1>
<p>In advance of making the decision to extend the pilot program, PBOT reviewed available data from April 26 through Nov. 30. Data included utilization of scooters, enforcement efforts and injury reports.</p>
<p>In advance of making the decision to extend the pilot program, PBOT reviewed available data from April 26 through Nov. 30. Data included utilization of scooters, enforcement efforts and injury reports.</p>
<p>Findings from the period include:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Riders took 954,156 trips and traveled 1,014,671 miles. Combined with trips during the 2018 pilot, e-scooter riders in Portland have cumulatively taken 1,654,485 trips and traveled 1,816,559 total miles. Companies report having tens of thousands of customers in Portland. From the 2018 pilot program, PBOT learned that e-scooters replaced driving and ride-hailing trips: 34 percent of Portland riders and 48 percent of visitors reported using an e-scooter instead of driving a personal car or using Uber, Lyft, or a taxi.</li>
<li>In response to public input during the 2018 pilot, PBOT regulatory and parking enforcement staff have been issuing warnings and fines to e-scooter companies, which are required to pass them onto their riders. PBOT staff have issued 57 warnings and 723 penalties for instances of improper parking and sidewalk riding.</li>
<li>Multnomah County Health Department identified 183 visits to emergency departments and urgent care clinics that were related to e-scooters. Their analysis includes all e-scooter related visits, including privately owned as well as rented e-scooters, from April 26 to Sept. 30. MCHD will continue to monitor injury visits throughout the pilot program.<br /><br /></li>

<p class=""gdcaption""><em>Map by Portland Bureau of Transportation.</em></p>
<p>This route map shows the places where e-scooters were ridden in Portland from April 26 to Sept. 30. PBOT requires companies to deploy 15 percent of their scooters each day in East Portland to promote equitable access to these transportation options. The lightest blue color represents at least 100 trips on a street segment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class=""content-center"">Spin qualifies for fleet expansion by helping improve safety education, technology, affordability</h1>
<p>PBOT also announced today a modest expansion of the number of e-scooters permitted to operate in the city. Spin will be allowed to expand its fleet by 192 scooters, up from 641 scooters. The additional e-scooters could be deployed as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Spin qualified for a larger fleet by hosting safety workshops, having responsive communication with PBOT staff, working with e-scooter companies and PBOT on geofencing technology, featuring their affordability program prominently on their website, and collaborating with workforce development organizations.</p>
<p>PBOT offers incentives to e-scooter companies on a quarterly basis. The incentives encourage companies to advance the City's safety, equity and environmental goals.<br /> Spin's fleet expansion was based on a second quarterly incentive review period, from July 1 to Sept. 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the first review period, PBOT adjusted incentives to strengthen rewards for efforts to increase affordability and access to underserved Portlanders. PBOT based the incentives update on required data reports, questionnaires to companies and nonprofit partners, and assessment of company efforts to partner and meet City goals.</p>
<p>Additionally, earlier this month, Bolt suspended operations in Portland. Bolt can resume operations with 214 e-scooters when the company is ready to meet its permit obligations.</p>
<p>Based on this announcement, there are currently 2,865 permitted shared e-scooters in Portland, down from 2,887 previously. Each company is permitted the following number of scooters:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Bird &ndash; 525 scooters</li>
<li>Lime &ndash; 782 scooters</li>
<li>Razor &ndash; 525 scooters</li>
<li>Shared &ndash; 200 scooters</li>
<li>Spin &ndash; 833 scooters</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>(Dec. 31, 2019)&nbsp;It&rsquo;s been a big year for transportation in East Portland. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) wrapped up multiple projects this year, totaling over $8 million in investments. Another $13.6 million in projects are currently underway.</p>
<p>Highlights from this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>3,000 feet of new sidewalks on NE 148th Avenue from Glisan to Halsey streets, funded by Fixing Our Streets.</li>
<li>Completion of the Halsey-Weidler Streetscape project in Gateway along the Halsey-Weidler couplet between NE 100th and 114th avenues, funded by&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets</a>.</li>
<li>Upgraded traffic signals at nine intersections along 102nd Avenue between SE Washington Street and NE Sandy Boulevard (construction is 97% complete).</li>
<li>PBOT&rsquo;s new Gravel Street Service fills in ruts and potholes to smooth out Portland's gravel streets. PBOT tackled gravel streets in Southeast Portland (south of Division) during winter 2018/2019. This winter our crews will cover the rest of Southeast Portland and all of North and Northeast.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we look ahead to 2020, we are excited to announce the start of construction on 14 additional East Portland projects. This represents another $45 million for improved streets and safety upgrades.</p>
<p>All of our work in East Portland has been directly informed by the residents and businesses that make up one of Portland&rsquo;s fastest growing areas in the city. This work has built on the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/article/522796?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">East Portland Action Plan</a>, adopted by Portland City Council in 2009, as well as&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/54306?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">East Portland in Motion</a>, adopted in 2012.</p>
<p>Since then, PBOT staff have been talking with community members and incorporating what we&rsquo;ve heard into the numerous other plans and programs which guide our work citywide. This includes&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.pedpdx.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">PedPDX - Portland&rsquo;s Citywide Pedestrian Master Plan</a>;&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">our Vision Zero Action Plan</a>; the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://trimet.org/division/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Division Transit Project</a>&nbsp;with TriMet;&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets</a>; as well as our&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.saferoutesportland.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Safe Routes to School</a>&nbsp;program and much more.</p>
<p>These projects often require years of development. This means getting the design and scoping of each project right, getting feedback from the community, applying for state and federal grants, and continuously doing public outreach and engagement so neighbors can weigh in on project plans and designs. All this helps PBOT build a transportation system that serves everyone.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the thousands of East Portland residents who have taken the time to provide their constructive feedback on these projects and plans over the past decade. We are excited about the transportation improvements coming to East Portland in 2020 and we thank you in advance for your patience as we build a safer, more accessible transportation network that serves all East Portlanders.</p>

<h4><em>This blog post is the third installment of &ldquo;A Look Back&rdquo;, a column that examines Fixing Our Streets projects completed by the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT). This third piece will return to not just one project, but a series of projects that have changed the landscape of accessibility in Portland--Fixing Our Streets sidewalk improvements in East Portland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></h4>
<p>(Jan. 8, 2020) In just three short years, the Fixing Our Streets program has added sidewalks on several key routes, making it safer and more convenient for people to walk and access public transit.</p>
<p>These completed sidewalk projects are in East Portland and are focused on areas where there are known gaps in the sidewalk network. Using a data-driven&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/40390?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Vision Zero</a>&nbsp;approach to traffic safety, while also connecting people to popular destinations like transit stops, business centers, and schools is a key part of PBOT's long-term vision for Portland. According to the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://map.visionzeroportland.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Vision Zero Crash Map</a>, since 2008, the majority of pedestrian deaths and injuries have occurred in East Portland (Click&nbsp;<a href=""https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=5385b143768c445db915a9c7fad32ebe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">here</a>&nbsp;to view the map).</p>
<p>First identified in the East Portland in Motion plan as having strong community support, these sidewalk projects were made a reality when voters approved&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/64188?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets</a>&nbsp;in 2016,&nbsp;a 10-cent gas tax to rebuild our roads and make them safer. The projects include:<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/79232?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">NE 148th Avenue: from Halsey to Glisan Street</a>,<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/588994?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">&nbsp;SE Flavel Street: from 84th to 92nd avenues</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/588993?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">SE 112th Avenue: from Market Street to Powell Boulevard</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/76525?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">NE 102nd Avenue: from Sandy Boulevard to I-84</a>.</p>

<p>On SE Flavel Street, new sidewalks make it safer to walk to the MAX Green Line, the I-205 Multiuse Path, the Springwater Corridor as well as shops and restaurants on 82nd Avenue.</p>
<p>Another location, 102nd Avenue, is one of the most dangerous streets in Portland for pedestrians. The NE 102nd Avenue sidewalk project provided a much-needed safety improvement. PBOT&rsquo;s Vision Zero Action Plan ranks it in among the top 20 streets where pedestrians are killed or injured.&nbsp; The sidewalk provides a seamless walking route between Prescott Elementary and the Gateway Transit Center.</p>
<p>Similarly, the new sidewalks on SE 112th Avenue improve walking connections along a large north-south corridor and connect destinations like Kelly Butte Natural Area, Floyd Light Middle School and Mall 205.</p>
<p>Finally, on NE 148th Ave from Halsey to NE Glisan streets, PBOT built a staggering 3000 feet of sidewalk (the equivalent of 15 downtown city blocks)! It filled critical gaps in the East Portland sidewalk network, creating a contiguous sidewalk along this important street. Nine corner ramps and fifteen driveways were also updated during construction to bring them up to current ADA standards. Thanks to Fixing Our Streets funding, Portlanders will have an easier and safer time reaching Halsey HydroPark, Glenfair Elementary and the TriMet bus stops on NE Halsey and Glisan Streets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These projects, in total, created a full 2.75 miles of complete sidewalk network in East Portland!</p>
<p>Two big Fixing Our Streets&rsquo; sidewalk projects are going to construction in the coming months, both&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71661?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">SW Capitol Highway: Multnomah Village to West Portland</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/79660?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">N Willis Boulevard: Newman Avenue to Chautauqua Boulevard</a>&nbsp;will start construction in Winter 2020. Several Fixing Our Streets funded&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/71588?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Safe Routes to School</a>&nbsp;projects will also go to construction in 2020, including: Steele Street: from 92nd Avenue to the I-205 path and SW Carson Street: from 14th to 17th Avenue.</p>
<p>The Fixing Our Streets program, paid for by a local gas tax approved by Portland voters in May 2016 and a heavy vehicle use tax, is Portland&rsquo;s first local funding source for transportation. Fixing Our Streets is invested in street maintenance and safety improvements. The City Council ordinance included a project list that shows specific projects that are intended to be funded.

<p>(Jan. 10, 2020) With a variety of forecasts all calling for freezing temperatures and the potential for snow next week, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) urges the traveling public to get ready for winter this weekend.</p>
<p>PBOT crews will report to work on Sunday, to get equipment prepared for snow and ice response. Low temperatures could create slick conditions Sunday night at high elevations in the West Hills or East Portland. Snow or other winter precipitation could affect road and sidewalk conditions from Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>The public should be ready for the potential to telecommute or rely on public transit next week. The time to prepare yourself and your family is NOW!&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the forecast is still unclear, there are some simple things all Portlanders can do to prepare themselves for winter weather.</p>

<p>In icy conditions, PBOT strongly advises delaying travel if possible. If people must travel, PBOT recommends taking public transit.</p>

<p>(Monday, January 27, 2020) &ndash; The eastbound lane of West Burnside will remain closed between Barnes Road and Skyline Blvd for at least several more days, as PBOT engineers and maintenance crews monitor the area of an active landslide. The traveling public is advised to avoid the area, and if eastbound travel through the area is needed, to follow a signed detour along SW Barnes Road and Skyline Blvd.</p>
<p>The landslide was first reported on Friday morning, and PBOT crews responded to close off the area to the public, remove dump truck loads of debris and build a catchment wall to make it safer.</p>
<p>During inspections today, engineers determined that debris had continued to fall from the slide over the weekend. The slide remains active, with cracks at the top of the scarp that indicate a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>PBOT is proceeding with plans to remove loose material from the top of the scarp. The bureau needs to obtain specialized equipment to clear the material at risk of sliding.</p>
<p>Please avoid the area if possible and expect delays. We ask the public to travel cautiously, observe all directions by reader boards and flaggers, and use alternate routes.</p>

<p>(Jan. 28, 2020) After extensive outreach with leading Portland community organizations, advocates and committees, the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) released their&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/fixingourstreets2020?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">project list today for a continuation of Fixing Our Streets</a>, the street repair and traffic safety program funded by a 10-cent fuel tax and the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax. This will be presented to Portland City Council on Feb. 6 for referral to the May 2020 ballot. A renewal of the Heavy Vehicle Use Tax will also be presented to City Council, to ensure that businesses with heavy truck activity pay their fair share for street maintenance and safety as well.</p>
<p>At the most recent Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee meeting, the committee voted unanimously to refer the list to council for inclusion on the May 2020 ballot. The proposed renewal and project list has already been endorsed by multiple groups, including&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.bbpdx.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Business for a Better Portland</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.oregonwalks.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Oregon Walks</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://friends.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">1000 Friends of Oregon</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.rosewoodinitiative.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">The Rosewood Initiative</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.thestreettrust.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">The Street Trust</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://northwestdistrictassociation.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Northwest District Association</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""https://www.protec17.org/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Professional &amp; Technical Employees Local 17</a>, as well as the Portland&rsquo;s Pedestrian and Bicycle advisory committees, among others.</p>
<p>Since its passage, the Fixing Our Streets program has paved or improved 40 lane miles of road, constructed 300 new ADA ramps, updated 58 intersections for safety, and built 53 Safe Routes to School projects that serve a combined 31 elementary schools, eight middle schools and 10 high schools in Portland. It has also provided significant funding for major streetscape projects such as the Halsey-Weidler Streetscape Project in the Gateway neighborhood and the Foster Streetscape Project in Southeast Portland.</p>

<p>The program has also made major investments in the prosperity of minority-owned and emerging small businesses. PBOT has far exceeded the city&rsquo;s goal for participation by Oregon&rsquo;s Certification Office for Business Inclusion and Diversity (COBID)&rsquo;s categories of disadvantaged, minority, women, emerging small business, or service-disabled veteran business enterprises. In the first three years of the Fixing Our Streets program, 40% of all contracting dollars were awarded to COBID-certified firms &ndash; double Portland&rsquo;s citywide goal of 20% participation.</p>
<p>Building on the demonstrated success of&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""http://www.fixingourstreets.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">the original Fixing Our Streets program</a>, the bureau has developed a new list of $74.5 million in street repair and traffic safety projects and services.&nbsp; The list includes $25 million dedicated to paving, $5 million for new traffic signals, $4.5 million for sidewalks, and $4.5 million for street lighting, and millions more for better and safer access to schools, transit, and community services for Portland&rsquo;s kids, seniors, and families. Spending from the program will continue to be overseen by the Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee, which represents multiple communities with a stake in Portland&rsquo;s streets and roads.</p>
<p>""As one of the co-chairs of the Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee, I am excited to endorse a referral to voters for reauthorization,&rdquo; said Ashton Simpson, Community Asset Planner at The Rosewood Initiative. &ldquo;Fixing Our Streets is helping to address the long unfulfilled promises made to East Portland for safer streets. I am grateful&nbsp;for the strong leadership of Commissioner Chloe Eudaly and PBOT Director Chris Warner. I hope the voters approve the measure in May, because there is much more work to be done!""&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fixing Our Streets helps realize the safer, more mobile, and more sustainable Portland envisioned by the numerous plans and programs that direct PBOT&rsquo;s work citywide, including: the Vision Zero Action Plan, PedPDX: Portland&rsquo;s Citywide Pedestrian Master Plan, Safe Routes to School, and area plans like Southwest in Motion, Northwest in Motion.</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/fixingourstreets2020?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Fixing Our Streets (2020-2024)</a>&nbsp;project list builds on these plans and the extensive public input that informed them. It was also shaped by feedback from neighborhood stakeholders, transportation justice advocates, and business groups. The projects represent an expansion of what made the original Fixing Our Streets so successful: a relentless focus on repairs and improvements to make it easier and safer for all Portlanders to get where they need to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fixing Our Streets&rsquo; impact on Portland has been tremendous. We have invested millions in our Safe Routes to School network, repaired and repaved streets throughout the city, and expanded our walking and biking network with new sidewalks, neighborhood greenways, and protected bike lanes,&rdquo; said PBOT Director Chris Warner. &ldquo;Since its passage three and a half years ago, the bureau has worked internally to increase efficiencies, establish stronger project management protocols, and create better relationships with businesses and the greater Portland community. Fixing Our Streets has made us a more responsive bureau that is better equipped to take on new opportunities to further maintain and improve our city&rsquo;s transportation system. We take the trust Portlanders have placed in us very seriously and are ready to deliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s clear is that these Fixing Our Streets improvements have created an appetite for more,&rdquo; said Ashley Henry, Executive Director at Business for a Better Portland. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obvious to anyone traveling through Portland that the street maintenance backlog is vast, and it&rsquo;s devastating that we continue to set records for the number of Portlanders dying from traffic violence. We support the referral of a renewal of the gas tax as a dedicated funding source for maintenance and safety projects so that voters have the opportunity to extend the benefits of these investments to even more parts of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Improving our active transportation infrastructure is a key part of addressing climate change, and of creating walkable, attractive, cohesive, and safe communities,&rdquo; said Claire Vlach, Oregon Walks Plans and Projects Chair and Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee Member. &ldquo;We support Fixing Our Streets, and hope Portland will build upon the funding measure&rsquo;s successes to create a permanent revenue stream for transportation in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This program is essential to making our communities safer, livable and sustainable,&rdquo; said the Northwest District Association in their letter of support.</p>

<p>PBOT<strong>&nbsp;</strong>has several&nbsp;proven&nbsp;tools to&nbsp;significantly improve&nbsp;street&nbsp;safety.&nbsp;Establishing a citywide program for basic street safety services allows PBOT to deliver these services more responsively and efficiently.</p>

<p>The original Fixing Our Streets proposal for street repair and safety was passed by voters in May 2016. It is projected to bring in more than $85 million &ndash; over $76 million from the fuel tax alone and an additional $8 million from the Heavy Vehicles Use Tax, passed by City Council concurrent with the 10-cent fuel tax approved by voters. The City will annually audit the Fixing Our Streets program. This audit will be shared with the oversight committee and the public. Spending from the program will be overseen by&nbsp;the Fixing Our Streets Oversight Committee&nbsp;representing the many communities with a stake in Portland's streets and roads.</p>

<p>(Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2020) &ndash; Starting tomorrow and continuing through Sunday, PBOT crews will implement full closures of West Burnside during daytime work hours, between SW Barnes Road and Skyline Blvd.</p>
<p>The closures are needed so crews can bring in specialized equipment to remove material at risk of continuing to slide in an&nbsp;area affected by a landslide that occurred last Friday. The slide has continued to be active in recent days.</p>
<p>The road will be closed to all traffic from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day. Crews will open the westbound lane to travelers each day by about 3 p.m. Westbound travel is anticipated to be allowed from 3 p.m., and overnight, until the full closure resumes the following day.</p>
<p>The full closures will continue each day through Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBOT crews are hoping to reopen the road to all travel in all directions on Monday, Feb. 3, but the work is weather dependent and the schedule could change.</p>
<p>The traveling public is advised to avoid the area, and if travel is needed, to follow a posted detour along SW Barnes Road and Skyline Blvd to the south of Mount Calvary Cemetery. During full closures, eastbound and westbound traffic will be directed to the detour route.</p>
<p>The landslide was first reported on Friday morning, and PBOT crews responded to close off the area to the public, remove dump truck loads of debris and build a catchment wall to make it safer. Periodic closures have been in place since Friday.</p>
<p>During inspections, engineers determined that debris had continued to fall from the slide last weekend. The slide remains active, with cracks at the top of the scarp that indicate a threat to public safety. In the coming days, PBOT crews will remove loose material from the top of the scarp.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, crews cleared more debris that had fallen from the slope and was blocking stormwater in the area. They installed a stormwater pipe to improve drainage during the coming work in the area.</p>
<p><span class=""normaltextrun"">The work through Sunday will remove debris at risk of falling from the landslide. Eventually, the landowner and PBOT will likely need to return to the area for permanent improvements to stabilize the area.</span></p>

<p>(Friday, Jan. 31, 2020) &ndash; Portland Bureau of Transportation crews are reopening West Burnside by 3 p.m. today, three days early, after clearing debris from a recent landslide and working to make the area safe from imminent risk of additional slides.</p>
<p>Crews had implemented lane closures and full road closures since a landslide was reported at about 6:30 a.m. on Friday, Jan. 24.&nbsp;During inspections, engineers determined that debris had continued to fall from the slide last weekend. After clearing more than 80 cubic yards of debris in the hours after the slide was reported, crews removed another estimated 60 cubic yards on Thursday.</p>
<p>Road closures had initially been expected to continue through Sunday, with all lanes reopening on Monday Feb. 3, but the work proceeded faster than expected and City engineers have determined the slide appears to be stabilized.</p>
<p>Today, PBOT crews built a new, 80-foot catchment wall, comprised of Jersey barriers with strips of reflective material for visibility, replacing a prior structure that was installed on the day of the slide. Also today, crews placed more rock in the area to help keep the soil in place, cleared ditches to prevent flooding and used rock to enhance safety on roadside shoulders.</p>

<p>(Feb. 14, 2020) Portland City Council voted yesterday to adopt the&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/80076?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Rose Lane Project report</a>, the city&rsquo;s biggest-ever plan for prioritizing transit on our streets. Through a series of pilot projects to be implemented over the next two years, the Rose Lane Project will get buses and streetcars out of traffic using a variety of different solutions, including bus-only lanes, transit signal improvements and other tools. These improvements will make transit faster and more reliable for more than 100,000 transit riders on over 45 different lines.</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is already putting this vision into action. A series of transit priority projects will be implemented this summer through&nbsp;<a href=""/transportation/71158?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"">Central City in Motion</a>, PBOT's initiative to improve transportation in the city&rsquo;s core.&nbsp;These projects are set to significantly improve transit travel time by helping buses and streetcars travel through congested areas. Data from PBOT's 2019 transit priority projects show that improvements made in the central city are already having a positive impact on travel times and reliability across the transit system.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks the public will get a preview of 2020 Central City in Motion projects and other early Rose Lane projects through a&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/736435?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">series of public open houses</a>. At the open houses, community members will have the chance to preview these and other Central City in Motion improvements, ask questions and provide feedback. Refreshments will be provided. The same information will be provided at all three open houses &ndash; choose the one that works best for you!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tuesday, February 18 from 4 to 6 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;White Stag Building, 70 NW Couch Street, Portland OR 97209</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, February 26 from 5 to 7 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;Revolution Hall, Astoria Room, 1300 SE Stark Street, Portland OR 97214</li>

</ul>
<p>Central City in Motion is already delivering big benefits for transit routes that run through downtown thanks to bus priority treatments implemented in 2019 on&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/731989?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">SW Madison Street</a>,&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/732005?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">NW Everett Street</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/article/732053?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Burnside Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/roselane?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Rose Lane Project</a>&nbsp;will build on the success of these improvements, spreading a network of transit priority citywide to maximize impact. Making transit faster and more reliable through these investments is a key part of PBOT&rsquo;s strategy to make our transportation system more equitable and to reduce climate impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a title="""" rel=""noopener"" href=""/transportation/ccim?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"" target=""_blank"">Central City in Motion</a>&nbsp;projects that will form early parts of the Rose Lane network include:</p>

<li><strong>Transit priority lanes on MLK and Grand benefitting TriMet&rsquo;s Line 6 and Streetcar</strong>&nbsp;(from NE Broadway to SE Mill)</li>
<li><strong>SE Hawthorne bus and turn lane along with crossing and bicycling improvements&nbsp;</strong>(from the Hawthorne Bridge to SE 12th Ave)</li>
<li><strong>SE Madison bus lane improvements&nbsp;</strong>(SE 11th&nbsp;to Grand)</li>
