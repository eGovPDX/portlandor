<p>The Oregon Department of Energy provides residential homeowners with up to a $6,000 tax credit for their 2017 taxes (with credit taken over four years) for the installation of solar energy systems. In order to qualify for this tax credit, individual projects need to have <strong>installation completed and final permits issued by the City of Portland by Sunday, April 1, 2018. </strong>Only homeowners who purchased solar systems by Dec. 31, 2017, are eligible for the tax credits.</p>
<p>If your project has been permitted or is currently under inspection, please pay prompt attention to this message. We would like to help make sure you meet the April 1 deadline to have your project obtain final approval from the City.</p>
<p>The BDS Residential Inspections Team has dedicated three consecutive Saturdays where inspectors will come to your residence to verify the installation and inspect for code compliance. Those dates are:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Saturday, March 17</strong></li>
<li><strong>Saturday, March 24</strong></li>
<li><strong>Saturday, March 31</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To sign up for an inspections appointment, <strong>Homeowners or Contractors must call 503-823-7388 by 3 p.m. on the Thursday prior to the requested Saturday inspection date. Once that call is received by BDS, customers will be notified by the Inspections Team with a service two-hour window. </strong>We will let you know of that window on the Friday afternoon before the date of service.</p>
<p>(This temporary Saturday scheduling option will not prevent Homeowners or Contractors from scheduling inspections through the regular IVR system to achieve inspections.)</p>
<p>There may be additional qualifications required by the Oregon Department of Energy. Please see <a href=""http://www.oregon.gov/energy/At-Home/Pages/Residential-PV.aspx"" target=""_blank"">more details on the state website</a> or call 1-503-378-4040.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beginning July 1, 2018, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Portland Bureau of Transportation will assess development fees for additions to residential units by the amount of square footage in each structure.</p>
<p>The new fee structure comes after both bureaus reassessed the way fees were determined. These system development charges, or SDCs, allow bureaus to recoup the cost of current and future City services that will be provided when new residential units go up.</p>
<p>The new SDCs are implemented through each bureau&rsquo;s administrative rules. Both bureaus made the changes so that the new rules are consistent. To allow time for notification to the development community, the new policies will begin July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>The <a href=""/citycode/article/582522"">new PP&amp;R administrative rule</a> and <a href=""/citycode/article/62417"">PBOT administrative rule</a> will exempt SDCs on residential additions smaller than 800 square feet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additions of 800 square feet or more of new residential space, that will move the dwelling unit into a new SDC size category, will be assessed based on their new size category and credited for the previous use based on the previous size category.</p>

<p class=""content-center""><strong>More about SDCs</strong></p>
<p><a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks SDCs</a> are one of the main sources of funding which Portland Parks &amp; Recreation utilizes to acquire and develop new parks, and add or expand features in existing parks. Contributions from construction projects across Portland have helped fund new projects throughout the city. <a href=""https://issuu.com/portlandparks/docs/sdc_funded_examples_for_bds_w/1?ff=true&amp;e=3709716/41537126"">See some recent projects that were funded by SDCs</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""/transportation/sdc"">Transportation SDCs</a> are one-time fees paid by developers when they build a new residential or commercial development. The fee covers part of the cost of building transportation facilities to serve new development&mdash;things like roads, sidewalks and other facilities that get people to where they need to go. TSDCs are intended to support new development by making investments to alleviate the increased demand on our transportation system.</p>
<p>System Development Charges can be financed by loan or deferral contracts, as outlined in City Code section <a href=""/citycode/28847"">17.14</a>. Upon notification that an applicant has been assessed a SDC fee, they may request to pay by a loan or deferral contract, at which point the Bureau(s) will prepare the contract for signature. Please contact PP&amp;R or PBOT staff if you have any questions about PP&amp;R or PBOT SDCs:</p>

<p><strong>Changes to the Zoning Code (Title 33) Sign Code (Title 32) to implement the <a href=""/bps/57352""><em>2035 Comprehensive Plan</em></a> will take effect at 1 p.m. on Thursday, May 24, 2018.</strong> These changes may have important ramifications for you if there are signs on your property or place of business.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sign Code (Title 32) is being updated to conform to new zones in the Zoning Code that were adopted as part of the <em>2035 Comprehensive Plan</em> in December 2016. While the sign allowances are not changing substantively, changes in zoning for some properties may result in different sign allowances.</li>
<li>While sign allowances will not change for the new zones in most cases, there will be some cases where customers will face a change in sign size allowance. Due to zoning changes, some existing signs will be considered non-conforming after May 24. This means any structural change (such as changing the bulb type) will trigger a new sign permit using the new allowances.</li>
<li>Sign allowances that were previously approvable will be reduced in some instances, depending on your new zoning. <strong>In order to maintain that previous size allocation, customers must have a sign permit under review, with intake fees paid by May 24 at noon</strong>, when the Development Services Center closes early for Residential Permit Night. <a href=""/bds/37988"">View the DSC hours</a>.</li>
<li>To be eligible to use the exception for existing signs, customers with issued sign permits affected by these changes will need BDS-approved final inspections.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out if these changes affect you, you&rsquo;ll need to do some research:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, determine the zoning for your property. Before May 24, you can find your zoning by entering your address on the <a href=""https://www.portlandmaps.com/bps/mapapp/maps.html#mapTheme=mrp"">Map Refinement Project</a> website and looking for changes on the right side. After May 24, you can find this information by entering your address on <a href=""https://www.portlandmaps.com/"">PortlandMaps</a> and looking at the Zoning field.</li>
<li>Next, check the Sign Code allowances for the new zone. <a href=""/bds/article/683135"">View the changes to the actual Sign Code (Title 32)</a>.</li>
<li>Exception for existing signs: Sign Code provides an exception for existing signs that have been established prior to November 18, 1998, or was allowed when established. Learn more about these allowances in <a href=""/citycode/article/18559"">Portland City Code 32.36.030</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BDS is here to help you have a smooth experience with these changes. If you have any questions, please call the BDS Sign Specialist at 503-823-7996.&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p><strong>Here are the specifics:</strong> The Building Code Plans Examiner&rsquo;s review will no longer be the last review point. Instead, it will be the second review point, immediately following Planning and Zoning. This changes the order in which building permit applications are reviewed and approved to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Screen</li>
<li>2nd Screen</li>
<li>Planning and Zoning</li>
<li>Building Code Plan Review</li>
<li>Interagency (IA) Partners</li>
</ul>
<p>DSC staff will be available to guide customers through the process improvements made on May 14. We appreciate your patience and cooperation while we work to try and improve the customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming pilot improvements are a part of a larger-scale effort to reduce customer wait times in the DSC based on suggestions from staff and managers from BDS and Interagency Partners who service the DSC. BDS staff are working to implement these changes, evaluate their success, and ultimately make applying for a permit more efficient for customers.</p>

<p>Are you wondering if your project has made it to the last stage of the permit review process so that you can pay fees, have the permit issued, and begin construction? Now, instead of calling us or visiting the DSC, you can access the list of pre-issuance processing order online.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the <a href=""/bds/article/688750"">pre-issuance list</a> to determine the status of your project. The list is updated daily for your convenience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More about the pre-issuance process</strong></p>
<p>Pre-issuance is the last step in the review process before BDS notifies the &nbsp;project applicant to let them know the permit is ready to be paid for and picked up. During pre-issuance, staff reviews all four plan sets to determine what changes were made during the review process and ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those changes do not impact another review</li>
<li>Red lines and City stamps are transferred and legible</li>
<li>All fees are accurate</li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-issuance is completed chronologically based on the sign-off date of the last technical review. Some factors can delay this process, including number of changes to the plan, complexity of the project and the communication of the changes made to the plan.</p>
<p><strong>What you can do to ensure a smoother process</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that BDS staff can complete a full review of your permit, please assist us to make sure your plans are complete. Review your plans to determine that all changes have been approved by City staff, that all redlines have been legibly transferred to the other plan sets, and that all sheets are complete and in order. With your help, your project can move quickly and efficiently through the pre-issuance process.</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px dotted gray; text-align: center; color: #202020; line-height: 150%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; display: block; box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888; background-color: #fafafa; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888;""><span style=""color: #505050;"">Policy for Extension on Residential Demolition Permits</span></h3>
<p>The following BDS policy is effective October 18, 2018. It outlines the BDS policy for granting extensions on residential demolition permits. The policy maintains the current BDS practice of allowing up to three permit extensions, but requires compliance with the dust and site control measures outlined in City Code Chapter 24.55 (SB 871 requirements).</p>
<p><strong>Pre-SB 871 Residential Demolition Permits</strong></p>
<p>Expired permits</p>
<ul>
<li>No re-activation, unless the structure has already been demolished, and the purpose is to close out the permit</li>
</ul>
<p>Permits under review, approved to issue, or under inspection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain existing policy of allowing three extensions, BUT all extensions will be granted subject to compliance with SB 871 requirements. Will require a revision to the permit for SB 871 compliance.</li>
<li>Any request for an extension after three have been granted will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Residential Inspections Division Manager and only granted if good cause for the extension is shown. Good cause must be something out of the applicant&rsquo;s control, such as a pending land use decision. Any extension will be granted subject to compliance with SB 871 requirements. Will require a revision to the permit for SB 871 compliance</li>
</ul>
<p>Active older permits (from 2000 - 2004)</p>
<ul>
<li>BDS Residential Inspections team will attempt to determine whether the structure has already been demolished. If so, the permit will be cancelled or finaled if possible</li>
<li>If BDS can&rsquo;t determine whether the structure has been demolished or if we know the structure is still standing, Residential Inspections team will manually draft letters informing the property owner that the permits will be expired within 30 days, unless BDS is contacted. Only if the owner/applicant contacts BDS within that time and indicates their intent to complete the project within 10 days will the project not be subject to SB 871. Any extensions beyond that 30 days will be subject to SB 871. Extension will require a revision to the permit for SB 871 compliance.</li>
<li>If BDS is not contacted within that time, or if the work is not complete within the 30 days or any extension, permits will be expired</li>

<p><strong>SERVICE UPDATE</strong><br />October 26, 2018</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px dotted gray; text-align: center; color: #202020; line-height: 150%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; display: block; box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888; background-color: #fafafa; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888;""><span style=""color: #505050;"">Coming Soon: A More Efficient Plan Review Process</span></h3>
<p>Over the next year, the City is phasing in a new more efficient plan review process for all types of building permits. This new process will establish dedicated windows of uninterrupted time for City staff to perform plan review. During these windows, applicants will not be allowed to submit corrections to checksheets. These review windows will create a more efficient development review process. This new process will be standard when electronic plan review is rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>Phasing of Review Windows</strong></p>
<p>We will be gradually phasing review windows into our process, starting with Process Managed Projects on November 1, 2018, and then New Single Family Residential (NSFR) Permits on January 2, 2019. Plan review windows should be fully implemented by October 1, 2019.&nbsp;<strong>Please see our plan review informational video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLbsTeyGrr8&amp;t=45s"">here&nbsp;</a>for more information.</strong></p>
<p>As we move closer to the implementation of review windows for NSFR Permits we will send out additional public notifications, as well as hold a Lunch and Learn event.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s how the change will benefit our customers:</strong></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Reduced interruption to the plan review process.</strong>&nbsp;Our staff will be able to focus on their reviews with less&nbsp;interruptions, which will produce more efficient review and feedback for our customers. When a customer submits&nbsp;corrections through a checksheet response, Permitting Services staff coordinates those corrections and routes&nbsp;the plans to our review groups in response to those corrections/updates. When customers submit additional&nbsp;corrections before other staff have finished their review, the reviewer must start over. When staff have&nbsp;uninterrupted time to focus on a review, they can complete that review more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Less routing of plans to reviewers.</strong>&nbsp;Bundling correction submittals reduces the amount of times Permitting&nbsp;Services staff need to route plans. This allows them to spend more time on the last stage of the review process,&nbsp;preissuance of permits.</li>
<li><strong>We are moving to ePlans (electronic plan review), which fully incorporates plan review windows.</strong>&nbsp;ePlans is a plan&nbsp;review system enabling plans to be reviewed, stamped and downloaded electronically. Applicants will be able&nbsp;to submit their plans remotely and view their project&rsquo;s status and details. Upon submittal, plans are&nbsp;immediately made available to all reviewers simultaneously, reducing the time needed to complete the&nbsp;review process. The City of Portland is currently in the first phase of the rollout with three applicants&nbsp;participating in the pilot program. Review windows are necessary to manage the electronic plan review process&nbsp;and requiring them for our current paper-based process will help applicants and City staff as we make the&nbsp;transition to ePlans.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are making this change to complete reviews and permits on a shorter timeline for our customers. BDS is always looking for ways to make our processes more efficient, and plan review windows will help our staff work quickly, producing results faster. More detailed information about plan review windows will be published as the implementation date nears.</p>

<p>The program guide for policies on when permits may be extended, when they are abandoned or expire, and when they may be reactivated after expiration has been updated. The existing program guide was limited to policies regarding extension and expiration of permits. The updated guide includes policies on reactivation of permits after they have expired. The guide applies to Commercial Residential, Facilities, Site Development, Development Review, Major Projects, Zoning, Sign, Plumbing, Electrical, and Mechanical Permits.</p>
<p>Permit applications or issued permits expire 180 days after the last activity by the applicant; usually a substantive response to a checksheet for a permit under review, or an approved inspection of an issued permit. Extensions of permit applications or issued permits for up to an additional 180 days may be requested during this time. Permits that are inactive for more than 180 days are either abandoned or expired, depending if the permit has reached issued stage or not. Once a permit is abandoned or expired, a reactivation of the permit may be requested. Requests for reactivations of permits that have been abandoned or expired for more than 180 days are generally more difficult to grant.</p>
<p>The updated program guide may be found <strong><a href=""/bds/article/290688"">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Also, a system for submitting requests to extend or reactivate permits has been created. The online requests will be forwarded to the appropriate work group for evaluation and response. These links may be found under the Permits Tab on the BDS Website, or directly <strong><a href=""/bds/77798"">here</a></strong>. You can choose to use the online request, or continue to use e-mail or phone. Those contacts are listed toward the end of the program guide.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Development Services made updates to the Program Guide on Permit Extensions, Abandonment, Expiration and Reactivations in November 2018. After having used the guide for a few months, staff and customers have identified several opportunities for clarification. Updates to the guide include:</p>
<ul>
<li>For permits under review, changed the maximum extension time for commercial permits from 90 days to 180 days to comply with the pending 2019 edition of the Oregon Structural Specialty Code (OSSC).</li>
<li>Clarified that the extensions are granted for a specific number of days from the date the permit is set to expire (as opposed to the date the extension is granted).</li>
<li>For permits under review, clarified that even if there is an incomplete checksheet response, or delays caused by other city processes, an extension request must still be submitted to keep the permit active, consistent with long-standing practice.</li>
<li>For permits under review, added language that within the last 30 days before expiration, ALL checksheet responses must be submitted to keep the permit active, consistent with long-standing practice.</li>
<li>Added a statement, consistent with city code, that permits are automatically extended each time it receives an approved inspection.</li>

<p>The Portland City Council views construction of Additional Dwelling Units (ADUs) as an essential component of meeting the City of Portland&rsquo;s housing density goals. Building permits submitted to the Bureau of Development Services that include new dwelling units are charged System Development Charges (SDC).&nbsp; These fees, which are assessed by the Water Bureau, Portland Parks and Recreation, Bureau of Environmental Services, and Portland Bureau of Transportation, are to help offset the impact that project will have on the City&rsquo;s infrastructure. To encourage development and increase housing stock, the <strong>Portland City Council began waiving SDC fees assessed to ADU permits in 2010. Last year, City Council revised the SDC waiver and reaffirmed a deadline for previously approved ADUs to complete construction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you applied for a permit to construct an ADU on or before July 31, 2018, your project must be constructed and receive final inspection approval by June 30, 2020.</strong> If your ADU project completion occurs on or after July 1, 2020, you will either need to pay SDC fees or comply with newly adopted rules of the ADU SDC Waiver Programs. &nbsp;If you intend to use the completed ADU, or any other structure on the lot, as an accessory short-term rental within the first 10 years of the final approval of the building permit, you will not be eligible for the SDC ADU Waiver Program and City Bureaus may collect applicable SDC fees. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When planning your project, please be mindful of this deadline. Although ADUs are typically smaller than single family residences, construction and inspections of an ADU does not happen on a shrunken schedule.</p>
<p>Participation in the SDC ADU Waiver Program requires a $400 processing fee paid to the <a href=""/BDS/article/689356"">City&rsquo;s</a> Revenue Division of the Office of Management and Finance. The SDC ADU Waiver Program also requires a Restrictive Covenant to be recorded with the Multnomah County Recorder&rsquo;s Office stating that you agree not to use any structure on the lot (including the ADU) as an accessory short-term rental for 10 years after final approval of the building permit. If the ADU is used as an accessory short-term rental at any time during the 10-year period, any waived SDC fees must be repaid at 150% of the then-current SDC rate. &nbsp;Specific guidelines on the new ADU SDC Waiver Program may be found <a href=""/bds/77447"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Zoning regulations related to ADUs, where they can be constructed and applicable design parameters are available in <a href=""/bps/index.cfm?a=53301"">the Portland Zoning Code, Chapter 33.205</a>. More information of System Development Charges can be found <a href=""/bds/article/166412"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Starting today, homeowners can see what type of projects qualify for the program and a complete list of all registered contractors to help in selecting a contractor for their project. Contractors interested in the FIR program can learn about the program requirements and determine if being a part of FIR would be the right fit for their business.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Development Services is working to make simple construction re-inspections as efficient as possible for both customers and staff. The new Remote Video Re-Inspection Program (RVR) provides an alternative to on-site inspection for situations requiring minor corrections. Using Skype and a mobile device, you can connect with BDS inspectors to complete simple re-inspections. <em>We are currently piloting this project to ensure proper functionality before making remote video re-inspections available to all BDS customers.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The RVR Program has several benefits:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>It saves time for you and BDS staff;</li>
<li>It lets you schedule the video re-inspection for when it&rsquo;s convenient for you;</li>
<li>It saves fuel and reduces emissions by reducing vehicle trips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch our quick video tutorial to see just how easy a remote video re-inspection can be:</p>

<p>To participate, customers must use the Skype application on a mobile device to interact with the City inspector. Download and Install Skype (NOT Skype for Business). You&rsquo;ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile device (smartphone, iPad, or other tablet). Please be aware that older mobile devices or mobile devices with older operating systems and lower resolution cameras may not work properly with the RVR program.</li>
<li>Strong Wi-Fi connection or Reliable data service (4G/LTE internet). Wi-Fi connection is preferred. If you have a limited cell data plan your service provider may charge you for data used during the re-inspection.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bureau of Development Services (BDS) is <strong>updating the interactive voice response (IVR) Inspection Request system message to include important details on Erosion Control Inspections</strong> (IVR Inspection #200), effective today. BDS ensures compliance with Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations as defined in <a href=""/citycode/28175"">Portland City Code Title 10.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you have an issued permit for ground disturbing activity, a Pre-Construction Erosion Control Inspection (IVR Inspection #200) is required before you can request or schedule other inspections through IVR.</strong> The Pre-Construction Control Inspection covers the temporary erosion, sediment and pollutant control measures required to be installed and inspected prior to any ground disturbance for the project (excluding ground disturbance necessary for the installation of the erosion, sediment and pollutant control measures).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pre-Construction Erosion Control Inspections (IVR Inspection #200) must be completed and approved before other inspections can be scheduled. If the Pre-Construction Erosion Control Inspection is not approved prior to another scheduled inspection, all other inspection requests will be cancelled and must be rescheduled within the IVR system.&nbsp;<strong>Please note:</strong> IVR Inspection #210 (Permanent Erosion Control Measures) must also be completed and approved before scheduling IVR Inspection #999 (Final Permit).</p>
<p>If you have questions about the Property Compliance Division or scheduling inspections, <a href=""/BDS/40466"">visit our webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Our old system, Permits Online, was developed back in 2005. &nbsp;Available technology has advanced beyond what Permits Online was able to do, and we can now offer our new expanded system, DevHub, which offers so much more!&nbsp; Both systems are available to use until <strong>noon on August 1<sup>st</sup></strong>, so customers will have time to get comfortable with the new system before we retire the Permits Online system. Customers and staff can still use Permits Online until August 1, 2019 at 12 p.m.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PDX ePlans provides a convenient central hub for development project stakeholders (including applicants, contractors and City reviewers) to communicate and complete the entire plan review process online, from submitting the initial application, to getting final approved plan sets electronically.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Development Services has rolled out PDX ePlans (electronic plan review) as an option for all <a href=""/bds/48323"">Process Managed projects</a> as of January 2019. Using ePlans, customers can submit their plans online to be reviewed electronically.&nbsp; The reviewers&rsquo; mark-ups and comments are applied in layers on the screen, so each reviewer can see the mark-ups and comments from all other reviewers.&nbsp; Staff at BDS and our partner bureaus can review the plans simultaneously on their computer screens. And if customers need to make a correction to their plans, they can submit those corrections online for re-review, saving a trip to the Development Services Center.&nbsp; Once the permit is issued, the applicant prints a set and has it available on site for the inspectors.</p>
<p>If you are interested in submitting your Process Managed project through ePlans, please contact your BDS Process Manager directly, or email <a href=""mailto:BDSProcessManagement@portlandoregon.gov"">BDSProcessManagement@portlandoregon.gov</a>.</p>
<p>Not submitting a <a href=""/bds/48323"">process managed project</a>? Stay tuned! ePlans is working to be rolled out to all commercial new construction permits in 2020.</p>

<p>Effective immediately, there are changes to the process for Property Line Adjustments (PLAs) for new applications or submitted applications that have not already received a checksheet. The changes are a result of a review of the City of Portland&rsquo;s process against existing state laws applied to PLAs (ORS 92.017, 92.192, and 92.010). In summary:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>The Bureau of Development Services (BDS) cannot reduce the number of units of land through a PLA (i.e. 3 lots become 2 PLA tracts).</li>
<li>A unit of land (lot, lot of record) must meet zoning standards after the PLA, including the lot dimension and area standards in 33.610/611/612/613/614.</li>
<li>BDS cannot consider combinations of multiple lots or portions thereof as a proposed tract, when determining whether lot size/dimension standards are met through a PLA.</li>
<li>PLAs not meeting the above requirements, will therefore require a Type Ix Lot Consolidation review first, so the PLA is between two units of land that continue to meet zoning code standards and ORS requirements.</li>
<li>A Lot Consolidation will not be required prior to a PLA, if the underlying lots continue to meet lot size/dimension standards on their own and there is not another reason for the Lot Consolidation, such as crossing lot lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions about how this information applies to your existing application, please contact your assigned planner. If you have questions about the process or requirements, please contact <strong><a href=""mailto:Stephanie.Beckman@portlandoregon.gov"">Stephanie Beckman</a></strong> (503-823-6979) or <strong><a href=""mailto:Kimberly.Tallant@portlandoregon.gov"">Kimberly Tallant</a></strong> (503-823-0977).</p>

<div dir=""ltr"">
<div class=""WordSection1"">
<p>Houston-based Zenith Energy is receiving a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO) from the City of Portland that will allow the company to begin using its newly-built racking system for unloading tank cars on its existing tank farm in Portland&rsquo;s Northwest Industrial District. The City&rsquo;s Bureau of Development Services is issuing the TCO because the new infrastructure complies with applicable code requirements. The project represents a significant safety upgrade to the site that includes a state-of-the-art fire suppression system, a spill containment facility in the offloading area and building sprinklers. The work does not expand the capacity of the existing storage tanks. The TCO allows the company to start using their new loading platforms while their old offloading system that does not have these safety features is taken offline and similarly upgraded. The TCO stipulates that Zenith must stop using their old offloading system.</p>
<p>The TCO is being issued to Zenith on Thursday, July 18, 2019.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decisions on permit applications are made according to the regulations that are in effect when the application is submitted,&rdquo; notes Terry Whitehill, Building Official with the City of Portland. &ldquo;Zenith originally filed their permit application with the City in 2014, two years prior to the City Council adopting amendments to the Portland Zoning Code related to fossil fuel terminals. The City cannot change the goalposts now and apply new, different requirements after the applicant has already submitted their permit application and been approved for construction. The project meets all applicable code requirements, so we have no authority to delay or deny the TCO.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bureau of Development Services Director Rebecca Esau fully acknowledges the predicament that Zenith Energy presents to the City given the City Council&rsquo;s renewable energy goals and opposition to the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. &ldquo;We completely share the Council&rsquo;s and public&rsquo;s concerns. Climate change is real, it&rsquo;s happening rapidly, and action is needed now. That action needs to come in many forms, including new regulations related to fossil fuels and renewable energy. City Council adopted regulations in 2016 but those regulations were appealed. As a regulatory agency that administers and enforces existing land use and building permit requirements, the Bureau of Development Services only has authority to apply the regulations that were in effect when Zenith Energy applied for their permit in 2014. Zenith is complying with all applicable code requirements, so the bureau must proceed with issuing the TCO. It&rsquo;s also important to note that their capacity at the site is not being expanded and these upgrades are making this facility safer for the public and the environment. As long as these facilities exist it&rsquo;s important that they are as safe as possible. At the same time, the City continues to take important steps to address fossil fuels in Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 2016 Fossil Fuel Terminal Zoning Code Amendments that were passed by City Council and then appealed will be brought back to Council in September. Expanded findings of fact will be presented to support the previously adopted code language that halts the expansion of new fossil fuel infrastructure in the City.

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<div class=""WordSection1"">
<p>BDS has approved a new <strong><a href=""/bds/article/740061"">code guide</a></strong> that will allow additional dwelling units, specifically Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), to be constructed within Townhouses if certain requirements are met, and will provide clear requirements for spaces used in common by multiple Townhouses. <strong>This code guide will be effective on Monday September 16, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>The Oregon Residential Specialty Code (ORSC) does not explicitly recognize ADUs. Instead, primary dwellings with attached or enclosed ADUs are treated as two-family dwellings under the building code, with specific modifications as expressed in BDS&rsquo;s ADU Program Guide. However, the ORSC definition of <em>townhouse</em> specifies that a townhouse is a <em>single</em> dwelling. This code guide provides for an alternate definition and equivalent standards for <em>two-family townhouses</em> (i.e. a townhouse with an ADU). The code guide thus provides an avenue for a townhouse with an ADU to be designed to the ORSC instead of requiring full compliance with standards for apartment buildings in the Oregon Structural Specialty Code (OSSC).</p>
<p>Highlights of the new code guide are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guide requires additional fire and life safety measures to provide equivalency for building two-family townhouses. For example, a 2-hour fire separation between the ADU and the Townhouse is not required; instead, a residential sprinkler system (NFPA 13D) is required.</li>
<li>A common trash room or bike storage room serving multiple Townhouses will be allowed provided the common space is separated from each of the Townhouses by 2-hour fire resistance rated construction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The code guide can be viewed <strong><a href=""/bds/article/740061"">here</a></strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>The City of Portland will be adopting the new Oregon statewide building code, Oregon Structural Specialty Code (OSSC) 2019 <a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/codes-stand/code-adoption/Pages/2019-ossc-adoption.aspx"">with an effective starting date of October 1, 2019. </a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, there will be a phase-in period wherein permit applicants will have the option for submitting for permits using either the current (2014) OSSC or the new (2019) OSSC. Starting January 1, 2020 all permits must meet the requirements of OSSC 2019.</p>
<p>Customers submitting applications for a permit using the OSSC 2014 after October 1, 2019 must, at a minimum, complete the application intake process, including the completeness review and payment of intake fees, <strong>before close of business December 31, 2019</strong> in order to be vested under 2014 OSSC. To allow enough time for complete review of your application before December 31, 2019, the City recommends that you submit your application by December 16, 2019 to be vested under 2014 OSSC. The <a href=""/bds/37988"">Development Services Center</a> will be <strong>closed on December 31, 2019</strong>, so customers intending to submit applications or pay intake fees before January 1, 2020 should plan accordingly.</p>
<p>For information regarding minimum submittal requirements please <a href=""/bds/article/92699"">click here.</a></p>
<p>Projects utilizing Phased Permitting Process Management are required (at a minimum) to submit Foundation (FND) or Structural (STR) partial permits by December 31, 2019 to be vested under 2014 OSCC. An excavation and shoring (EXC) partial permit <strong>would not</strong> be sufficient to vest a building in the 2014 OSSC. <a href=""/bds/48350#cid_740729"">Please click here for minimum submittal requirements for process managed partial permits.</a></p>
<p>If a land use review is required for your project, you must substantially complete the land use review prior to being allowed to submit a permit application.</p>
<p>Updated requirements in OSSC 2019 may impact the design of structures and cost of construction. The impact of the new requirements is entirely dependent on the type of structure, the use and occupancy, and the location. Changes to 2014 OSSC are extensive and should be discussed with the appropriate design professionals before submitting any project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable change is that the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code will adopt the <a href=""https://www.asce.org/structural-engineering/asce-7-and-sei-standards/"">ASCE 7-16 Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures</a>. Where the 2014 OSSC previously allowed 15% reduction in seismic forces for certain types of structures (when using Modal Response Spectrum Analysis per ASCE 7 12.9), <strong>the 2019 OSSC no longer permits the 15% reduction. This change will likely impact </strong>structures<strong> </strong>that require higher levels of structural lateral analysis (per ASCE 7 Table 12.6-1 for permitted analytical procedures), structures with structural irregularities (as defined by ASCE 7 Table 12.3-1 or Table 12.3-2) and/or structures greater than 160 feet tall.</p>
<p>Additionally, the design wind loading for structures has been reduced to considerable extent in certain areas and will likely result in less requirements, and lower costs, for structures whose lateral loads are governed by wind loads.</p>
<p>The State of Oregon Building Codes Structures Board plan to release code books in September 2019. Please contact the <a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/Pages/index.aspx"">Building Codes Division</a> for more information and updates on the availability of the new codes.</p>
<p>Applicants should consult with their design teams to ensure that your project is in line with updated requirements of the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code. Consult <a href=""https://codes.iccsafe.org/"">the International Code Council</a> for more information about changing codes and standards.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>Earlier this year, Portland City Council adopted changes to the Neighborhood Contact requirements found in the Portland Zoning Code. The purpose of the Neighborhood Contact requirement is to provide an informal sharing of information between the applicant of a development proposal and the people who live, work and pass by the site on a regular basis. This allows neighbors to give constructive feedback about the development proposal before the applicant has submitted for a building permit or land use review.<br />&nbsp;<br />This Bureau of Development Services video helps explain the new Neighborhood Contact requirements:</p>
<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""335"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynYZQYeZMQw"" width=""666""></iframe>
<p>The primary changes to the Neighborhood Contact requirements involve:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Projects requiring Neighborhood Contact</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Neighborhood Contact requirements are now based on the size of the building or how many lots the site is divided into, and also include proposals involving both a land division and environmental review.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Delivery method</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Now applicants can use email or standard mail to notify neighborhood associations, district neighborhood coalitions, business associations and, in some cases, school districts of an upcoming building permit or land use review proposal that requires Neighborhood Contact.</li>
<li><strong>Burden of responsibility</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; The current version places responsibility on the neighborhood association to host a meeting. The new version primarily places responsibility on the applicant, although the neighborhood association has the option to host some of the meetings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Applicants are now required to install a sign or signs on the site notifying neighbors of an upcoming development proposal before an application is submitted to the City. The Bureau of Development Services also has a new online tool for those who want to know about larger development proposals that require Neighborhood Contact.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Neighborhood Contact requirements go into effect on December 2, 2019; however, because these requirements must be completed before a building permit or land use review application is submitted, the new requirements may apply to development proposals now.<br /><br />In order to further assist applicants and neighbors navigate the new requirements, the Bureau of Development has developed the following materials:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong><a title=""https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/49163"" href=""/bds/49163"">Neighborhood Resources Webpage</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this webpage provides a variety of information that neighbors may find helpful when navigating Portland&rsquo;s land use and zoning processes. The website contains information concerning the Neighborhood Contract requirements including the materials below.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/article/742726"">Neighborhood Contact Overview</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; the overview provides details on when Neighborhood Contract is required, the documentation required to be submitted, and a description of the requirements.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/article/743077"">Information for Applicants</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this document provides step by step instructions to help applicants complete the Neighborhood Contact process and properly document that requirements were met.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/article/743076"">Certification Statement</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this document provides a summary of the Neighborhood Contact submittal requirements and provides a form that applicants can sign to demonstrate other requirements were met.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/article/742947"">Instructions for Neighborhood Contact Sign</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this webpage provides step by step instructions for creating the sign(s) required for the site.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/79868"">Development Sign Templates</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this webpage contains links to three software programs with fillable templates to create the sign.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""/bds/article/743357"" target=""_blank"">Administrative Rule for Neighborhood Contact Sign</a></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; this Administrative Rule codifies the requirements related to the Neighborhood Contact sign.</li>

<p>The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is seeking to adopt a new administrative rule. <strong>TRN 1.28 Curb Extensions for Buildings and Planning Actions</strong> clarifies under what conditions curb extensions will be required in relation to corner reconstruction.

<p>Effective <strong>Thursday, November 7, 2019</strong> the deadline for submitting a building code appeal changes from Monday to Thursday. The City must be in receipt of a building code appeal application no later than 9 a.m. on Thursday for an appeal request to be reviewed by the board the following Wednesday.</p>
<p>Building code appeals are an administrative review led by the City&rsquo;s Building Official and reviewed every Wednesday morning. The appeal board reviews requests to provide an alternative construction method to any of the following codes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Oregon Structural Specialty Code</li>
<li>Oregon Residential Specialty Code</li>
<li>Oregon Mechanical Specialty Code</li>
<li>Oregon Electrical Specialty Code; and the</li>
<li>Oregon Plumbing Code</li>
</ol>
<p>The appeal process provides an opportunity for customers to submit development proposals that will meet the intent of the building code when compliance with the letter of the code is not feasible. Building code appeal meetings at this level are closed to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current application deadline to request an appeal is 9 a.m. on the Monday immediately preceding a Wednesday review. The new Thursday deadline provides two additional business days for staff to review and comment on an appeal request and applicants to submit additional materials when needed. The proposed change will offset the impacts associated with the following issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>An overall increase in the number of building code appeal applications;</li>
<li>Increased complexity in the types of appeals requested;</li>
<li>Insufficient time for staff to review and submit comments on appeal requests;</li>
<li>Insufficient information and/or incomplete appeal applications; and</li>
<li>Insufficient time for applicants to submit additional materials to support an application when needed.</li>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>City Council adopted amendments to Title 11, Trees, in 2016 to strengthen regulations pertaining to tree preservation (especially preservation of large sized trees) in development situations on private property. The amendments were adopted with a scheduled sunset date of December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>Council took this action in response to concern about large trees being removed in development situations in Portland neighborhoods<strong>. The Portland Planning and Sustainability Commission (PSC) has recommended, in part, that the amended regulations should be extended 2 years until December 31, 2021. The Urban Forestry Commission (UFC) has recommended, in part, that the amended regulations should be extended 2 years until December 31, 2021 or for the duration of any future Climate Emergency declared by City Council. </strong>The recommendations from PSC and UFC will be heard by City Council on Wednesday, November 13, 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Additional components of the PSC and UFC recommendations will be heard by City Council separately, on December 5, 2019.</strong></p>
<p>The recommendations to be discussed on December 5, 2019 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removal of an exemption from tree preservation in development situations on portions of sites zoned CX, EX, IG1 and IH until December 31, 2021.</li>
<li>Reduction of the tree size threshold for trees subject to required tree preservation or fee in lieu of preservation and &ldquo;inch-per-inch&rdquo; mitigation fee in-lieu of preservation to from 36&rdquo; to 20&rdquo;, for the duration of any future Climate Emergency declared by City Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ll post more information regarding that hearing when it becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>City Council Hearing</strong></p>
<p>City Council will hear the proposal to extend the date of 2016 amendments:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, November 13, 2019<br /></strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Council Chambers<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>1221 SW 4th Avenue, City Hall<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>4:20 p.m. Time Certain<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>(Time Certain means the agenda item will not begin before the scheduled time)</strong></p>
<p>For information on how to testify before City Council in person or in writing, see the <a href=""/auditor/26979"">Council Clerk&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Summary of 2016 Amendments</strong></p>
<p>The amendments adopted in 2016 and now recommended for extension until December 31, 2021 are summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Continued to require that at least 1/3 of non-exempt trees be preserved or pay a fee in-lieu of preservation, regardless of tree size. Added requirement that all non-exempt trees 36 inches or larger in diameter be preserved or pay a fee in-lieu of preservation.</li>
<li>Amended the fee in-lieu of preservation as follows:<br />a. For removal of non-exempt trees with a diameter of 12 inches or larger, but less than 36 inches, a graduated scale is used to determine the payment amount. Based on the current fee schedule, the fees are $1,800-$3,600 per tree removed.<br />b. For removal of non-exempt trees with a diameter of 36 inches or larger, an &ldquo;inch-per-inch mitigation&rdquo; payment is required. Based on the current fee schedule, fees start at $16,220 for removal of a 36-inch diameter tree and increase at $450 per additional diameter inch of tree removed.</li>
<li>Required applicants to post a notice on-site and send a notice to the neighborhood association and district coalition 45 days prior to development permit issuance for removal of non-exempt trees 36 inches in diameter or larger.</li>
<li>Exempted certain affordable housing projects, as defined by the Portland Housing Bureau, from the fee in-lieu of preservation for removal of non-exempt trees 36&rdquo; in diameter or larger.</li>
<li>Included an end date of December 31, 2019.</li>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>The City of Portland has adopted the new Oregon statewide building code, <a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/codes-stand/code-adoption/Pages/2019-ossc-adoption.aspx"">Oregon Structural Specialty Code (OSSC) 2019</a>, which fully takes effect for all permitted projects on January 1, 2020. Through December 31, 2019, permit applicants may submit for permits using either the current (2014) OSSC or the new (2019) OSSC.</p>
<p>Customers submitting applications for a permit using the OSSC 2014 prior to the January 1, 2020 deadline must, at a minimum, complete the application intake process, including the completeness review and payment of intake fees,&nbsp;before close of business December 31, 2019&nbsp;in order to be vested under 2014 OSSC. <strong>To allow enough time for complete review of your application before December 31, 2019, the City recommends that you submit your application prior to December 16, 2019 to be vested.</strong></p>
<p>For information regarding minimum submittal requirements please&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/92699"">click here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/37988"">Development Services Center</a>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;closed on December 24, 25 and 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020 for the holidays, so customers intending to submit applications or pay intake fees before January 1, 2020 should plan accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Applicants should also prepare for the possibility of delays in their plan review timelines based on the volume of permit applications received in December. Additionally, the City will be replacing the TRACS permitting system with a new software on February 3, 2020, which could lead to further temporary delays in plan review timelines and wait times in the Development Services Center through the end of February as staff adapt to the new system. The City asks for patience during this busy period.</strong></p>
<p>If a land use review is required for your project, you must substantially complete the land use review prior to being allowed to submit a permit application.</p>
<p>Updated requirements in OSSC 2019 may impact the design of structures and cost of construction. The impact of the new requirements is entirely dependent on the type of structure, the use and occupancy, and the location. Changes to 2014 OSSC are extensive and should be discussed with the appropriate design professionals before submitting any project.</p>
<p>One notable change is that the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code will adopt the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.asce.org/structural-engineering/asce-7-and-sei-standards/"">ASCE 7-16 Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures</a>. Where the 2014 OSSC previously allowed 15% reduction in seismic forces for certain types of structures (when using Modal Response Spectrum Analysis per ASCE 7 12.9),&nbsp;the 2019 OSSC no longer permits the 15% reduction. This change will likely impact&nbsp;structures&nbsp;that require higher levels of structural lateral analysis (per ASCE 7 Table 12.6-1 for permitted analytical procedures), structures with structural irregularities (as defined by ASCE 7 Table 12.3-1 or Table 12.3-2) and/or structures greater than 160 feet tall.</p>
<p>Additionally, the design wind loading for structures has been reduced to considerable extent in certain areas and will likely result in less requirements, and lower costs, for structures whose lateral loads are governed by wind loads.</p>
<p>The State of Oregon Building Codes Structures Board plan to release code books in September 2019. Please contact the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/Pages/index.aspx"">Building Codes Division</a>&nbsp;for more information and updates on the availability of the new codes.</p>
<p>Applicants should consult with their design teams to ensure that your project is in line with updated requirements of the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code. Consult&nbsp;<a href=""https://codes.iccsafe.org/"">the International Code Council</a>&nbsp;for more information about changing codes and standards.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/codes-stand/code-adoption/Pages/2019-omsc-adoption.aspx"">2019 Oregon Mechanical Specialty Code (2019 OMSC) is being changed on a similar timeline</a>.&nbsp;You can sign up for&nbsp;<a href=""https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/ORDCBS/subscriber/new?topic_id=ORDCBS_426"">email updates</a>&nbsp;from the State of Oregon to receive information about code adoption.

<p>Why this change in our schedule? The Bureau of Development Services and our other agency partners are upgrading the software used to manage the review, permitting, and inspection processes of building and development projects. The current software - TRACS - is an out of date program that will be replaced by a new software &ndash; AMANDA &ndash; which will provide the City with a modern, web-based platform that can be easily updated. AMANDA will launch in February 2020.</p>
<p class=""content-left""><strong>The Development Services Center will be closed to the public on Thursdays from December 19 through the end of February 2020 in order to provide staff with sufficient time to test and train in the new system. </strong></p>

<p>Earlier this year, BDS proposed an amendment to Title 11, Trees, to extend the sunset date of certain regulations passed in 2016 that strengthened tree preservation requirements (especially preservation of large sized trees) in development situations on private property. (<a href=""/bds/article/745330"">Link to previous posts and updates</a>)</p>
<p>As part of that process,<strong> the Portland Planning and Sustainability Commission (PSC) and the Urban Forestry Commission (UFC) made additional recommendations relating to tree preservation in development situations on private property</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Those recommendations were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove an exemption from tree preservation in development situations on portions of sites zoned CX, EX, IG1 and IH until December 31, 2021</li>
<li>Reduce the tree size threshold for trees subject to required tree preservation or fee in lieu of preservation; and &ldquo;inch-per-inch&rdquo; mitigation fee in-lieu of preservation to from 36&rdquo; to 20&rdquo;, for the duration of any future Climate Emergency declared by City Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>In response to those recommendations, and general community interest in Title 11, Trees,<strong> Mayor Wheeler has proposed a resolution for future Title 11 projects regarding trees in development situations.&nbsp;<strong>The Mayor is seeking input from the public on the draft Resolution.</strong>&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/749167"">Read the draft resolution here</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>SERVICE UPDATE</strong><br />January 6, 2020</p>
<h3 style=""margin: 0px 0px 20px; padding: 10px; border: 1px dotted gray; text-align: center; color: #202020; line-height: 150%; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; display: block; box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888; background-color: #fafafa; -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 2px 1px #888888;"">Building Official Determination:&nbsp;Accessory Kitchens in Single Family Dwellings<br />ORSC 202 Definition of Dwelling Unit</h3>
<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>The Bureau of Development Services has a new Building Official Determination that clarifies the requirements for when an accessory kitchen can be built within a single-family dwelling unit. It also includes an example of the covenant that would be required as part of the approval of the additional kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> Can a single-family dwelling have more than one kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong> The Oregon Residential Specialty Code doesn&rsquo;t limit the number of kitchens in a single-family dwelling. However, the 2017 ORSC defines a dwelling unit as, &ldquo;A single unit providing complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation.&rdquo; (ORSC R202). BDS seeks to avoid illegal conversions of single-family dwellings into duplexes or multi-family structures. Such conversions create fire and life safety issues for the residents because the structures do not comply with the ORSC requirements for multiple dwelling units in a single structure or attached structures. In order to accomplish this goal, BDS will require a building permit to install a new kitchen within a single-family dwelling and will impose certain conditions outlined in this document. In order to install an additional kitchen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The accessory kitchen may be located in a portion of the building that would meet the definition of a dwelling unit only if that portion of the building is not and will not be separated from the rest of the building by walls or closing a door.</li>
<li>The accessory kitchen may not be located in a detached structure with a bathroom.</li>
<li>Any additional accessory kitchen installed in a single-family dwelling must comply with all of the same Electrical, Plumbing and Mechanical Code requirements as the main kitchen.</li>
<li>The home owner must complete and record an &ldquo;Additional Accessory Kitchen Covenant&rdquo; prior to a building permit being issued. That Covenant is the property owner&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the structure will remain a single-family dwelling and that the accessory kitchen will not become part of an additional dwelling unit without obtaining a building permit for the creation of the additional dwelling unit. A copy of the recorded Covenant must be provided to BDS as a condition of permit Issuance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE: This Building Official Determination may not be utilized for structures containing Accessory Dwelling Units, structures that are considered a duplex or multifamily structures per the ORSC.</strong></p>

<p>On February 7, 2020 the City of Portland completed successful migration to an upgraded version of AMANDA, the permitting software we use to manage development data.&nbsp;Bureau of Development Services Director Rebecca Esau and Jeff Baer, the City&rsquo;s Chief Technology Officer, determined the system is ready for use and announced that AMANDA will launch as scheduled this Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Normal business hours resume on Monday, February 10.&nbsp;<em>Please note: The Bureau of Development Services will be closed to customers on Thursday, February 13 and Thursday, February 20.</em> The Thursday closures end in March 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/751809"">Click here to view the full February 2020 schedule.</a></h2>
<p>The upgrade of our former &ldquo;TRACS&rdquo; permitting system has been an extremely complicated project that involved multiple stakeholders and more than 1,200 users all across the City of Portland. With AMANDA, the City and other local agencies that access our permitting software will now have a modern, web-based system that provides a stable platform on which we can upgrade existing features and build new functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience during our software upgrade!&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>The Bureau of Development Services has a new Building Official Determination that clarifies the difference between a dwelling unit and a congregate living facility in the building code.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>&nbsp;When grouped together in a building, congregate living facilities can look like dwelling units. What is the difference between a dwelling unit and a congregate living facility in the building code?</p>
<p><strong>2019 OSSC DEFINITIONS:</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>DWELLING UNIT. </strong>A single unit providing complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation. <br /><strong>CONGREGATE LIVING FACILITIES.</strong> A building or part thereof that contains sleeping units where residents share bathroom or kitchen facilities, or both. <br /><strong>SLEEPING UNIT.</strong> A single unit that provides rooms or spaces for one or more persons, includes permanent provisions for sleeping and can include provisions for living, eating and either sanitation or kitchen facilities but not both. Such rooms and spaces that are also part of a <em>dwelling unit are not sleeping units</em>.<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE:</strong>&nbsp;The places in which we reside are a higher fire safety risk than most other occupancies for many reasons. For example, the occupants are asleep approximately one third of every 24 hour period and unaware of developing fires. Also, within their own homes occupants often let fire hazards go unabated, so the hazards can accrue and go unnoticed. As a result, the building code requires fire and sound separations to compartmentalize the hazards and insulate occupants from each other.</p>
<p>2019 OSSC sections 420.2 and 1206 require fire and sound separation between dwelling units. Separations are also required between sleeping units when they are not part of a dwelling unit. Therefore, a congregate living facility would need to have fire and sound separations between the sleeping rooms, but bedrooms in a dwelling unit would not need to be separated from each other.</p>
<p>To capture the protections put in place for occupants, the City of Portland has determined that congregate living facilities are a collection of independently leased sleeping rooms for persons not of the same family group with shared cooking and/or bathroom facilities. By contrast, a dwelling unit is leased as a whole to one or more persons.</p>
<p>The building code does not provide a prescriptive definition (area limitation or maximum number of bedrooms) to distinguish a dwelling unit from congregate living. The building code requirements are based on how the unit will be used. Therefore, when a dwelling unit has more than 6 bedrooms, the City of Portland will review them as sleeping units.</p>
<p>The City of Portland may consider an administrative appeal that includes a memo from the owner or property management company that states the leasing arrangement. The memo must identify whether the individual bedrooms are being leased separately and independent of each other (congregate living facility), or if the entire space including all bedrooms are being leased under a single rental agreement (dwelling unit).</p>
<p>The occupant load of the dwelling unit or congregate living facility will be determined in accordance with OSSC Section 1004.5 using the occupant load factor of one occupant per 200 square feet of floor area. However, the occupant load is permitted to be designed for an increased number of occupants, provided that all other requirements of the code are met based on the modified number (1004.5.1).</p>

<p>The Bureau of Development Services (BDS) has adopted an <strong><a href=""/bds/article/752184"" target=""_blank"">Interim Residential Demolition Administrative Rule</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong>effective February 10, 2020</strong>, that revises the inspection requirements for demolitions of residential structures with four or fewer dwelling units and any detached accessory structures with a floor area&nbsp;more than&nbsp;200 square feet on the same site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Interim Rule requires the Demolition Manager or Lead-Based Paint Certified&nbsp;Person to meet with the inspector at the #200 inspection, in addition to the other requirements. The Rule also requires two #205 inspections that must be requested and scheduled through the City&rsquo;s&nbsp;Interactive Voice Response (IVR)&nbsp;system. &nbsp;The first of these inspections now requires that the Demolition Manager or Lead-Based&nbsp;Paint Certified Person is on-site during the inspection and that the exterior painted surfaces have been removed. The second #205 inspection&nbsp;must be scheduled so that the inspector is on-site when mechanical demolition begins&nbsp;in order to verify the effectiveness of the dust suppression wetting system and the wind speed.&nbsp;The second #205 inspection may be conducted via a live-streaming inspection using live video streaming technology pre-approved by BDS.&nbsp;There are no changes to the #210 inspection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Interim Rule will be effective for 180 days from February 10, 2020 or until the permanent rule is adopted.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Development Services (BDS) and Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) request comments from the public on proposed new administrative rules to be jointly adopted and administered by BDS and BES. The proposed rules would govern notification requirements applicable to a property owner who wishes to cap a neighbor&rsquo;s private sewer that crosses the first property owner&rsquo;s property without a recorded legal easement. If a property owner has a recorded legal easement for their private sewer to cross their neighbor&rsquo;s property and the easement meets the requirements specified in the proposed rules, the City will not issue the neighbor a plumbing permit to cap the other property owner&rsquo;s sewer line. The proposed rules primarily memorialize, and thereby improve transparency of, existing policies and practices.</p>
<p>The proposed rules and a fact sheet about the rule-making are available below. BDS and BES will accept public comment on this proposal from 8:00 a.m. Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, through 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, Mar. 4, 2020. BDS and BES will hold a joint public hearing&nbsp;by request only&nbsp;from 4:30 to 6:00 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2020, in Conference Room 4(a) (4th Floor) of the Development Services Center, 1900 SW 4th Ave., Portland, OR 97201. BDS and BES will cancel the tentative hearing if they receive no hearing request by 5:00 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 20, 2020, and will post a cancellation notice on this page.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>On July 23, 2019, the Governor of Oregon signed <a href=""https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2019orlaw0623.pdf"">Senate Bill 534 (SB 534)</a> into law, with an implementation date of March 1, 2020. It requires that development of at least one dwelling unit be allowed on each platted lot (result of a subdivision or partition), unless the City determines the lot is constrained by lack of infrastructure, steep slopes, natural resources or hazards.</p>
<p>At this time, Portland's Zoning Code (Title 33) has not been amended to conform to the requirements of the new state law. Starting Monday, March 2, the Bureau of Development Services (BDS) will implement the requirements of the new state law. In addition to the allowances for primary structures in Title 33, development of a primary structure will be allowed as described below. If any of the Title 33 allowances for primary structures in residential zones or plan districts preclude a primary structure based on the characteristics of the site or ownership, the allowances described below prevail. If the lot is precluded under both Title 33 allowances and the allowances described below, a primary structure is not allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements for a Primary Structure on Platted Lots</strong></p>
<p>A primary structure is allowed on a lot that is fully intact as originally platted, except as reduced in size due to right-of-way dedication or condemnation; on an adjusted lot that is larger than the originally platted lot; or a combination thereof, that meets the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>No portion of the lot, adjusted lot or combination is in an environmental protection or environmental conservation overlay zone;</li>
<li>No portion of the lot, adjusted lot or combination is in the special flood hazard area; and</li>
<li>The lot, adjusted lot or combination has an average slope of less than 25 percent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Title 33 definitions (33.910) and measurements (33.930) apply.</p>
<p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>
<p><em>Lot Confirmation:</em> To confirm that a lot is eligible for a primary structure, submit a Lot Confirmation application. Deed information showing the lot meets Title 33 definitions is required for any lot that is not fully intact as platted. More information is on the <a href=""/bds/article/115434"">application form</a>.</p>
<p><em>Building Permit:</em> Eligibility of existing tax lots for a primary structure can be determined through a building permit review</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir=""ltr"">
<p>On February 5, City Council adopted an ordinance to amend the <a href=""/transportation/67263"">Transportation System Plan</a> to incorporate new pedestrian classifications. The new pedestrian classifications include changes to Pedestrian District boundaries to align with all designated &ldquo;Centers&rdquo; and major Transit Station Areas, as defined by Portland&rsquo;s <a href=""https://beta.portland.gov/bps/comp-plan/2035-comprehensive-plan-and-supporting-documents"">2035 Comprehensive Plan</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What changed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedestrian Districts.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the boundaries of existing Pedestrian Districts have expanded,</li>
<li>Some Pedestrian Districts are new, and</li>
<li>Some former Pedestrian Districts have been removed because they are no longer classified as Pedestrian Districts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pedestrian classifications. </strong>Some streets may have a pedestrian classification that is higher or lower than it was before.</p>
<p><strong>How might this impact sidewalk design/ frontage improvement requirements?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""/article/437808"">Portland Pedestrian Design Guide</a> uses pedestrian classifications to determine the sidewalk design/ frontage improvement requirements associated with private development. Applications for building or development permits or land use reviews submitted on or after <strong>March 6, 2020</strong> must meet frontage improvement requirements associated with new pedestrian classifications, per the existing Pedestrian Design Guide.</p>
<p><strong>How do I check the new Pedestrian District boundaries and new pedestrian classifications?</strong></p>
<p>Scrollable maps of <a href=""http://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=f0b9f95b3fc44cff946bd58707e99bb2"">new pedestrian classifications are available here.</a></p>
<p><strong>What should I expect in Development Review?</strong></p>
<p>During the interim period on or after March 6, 2020 when new pedestrian classifications take effect, and before adoption of an updated Pedestrian Design Guide (anticipated 2021), PBOT Development Review will apply the 1998 Pedestrian Design Guide to new 2020 pedestrian classifications as follows:</p>
<table style=""width: 550px;"" border=""0"" align=""center"">

<p><strong>What additional sidewalk design/ frontage requirements may come in 2021?</strong></p>
<p>Future updates to the Pedestrian Design Guide may include, but are not limited to, updates to sidewalk design criteria for various pedestrian facilities, including requirements for minimum sidewalk widths, placement of street trees and sidewalk furnishings, and street corner design at crossings.</p>

<p>Prior to the spread of COVID-19, BDS had intended to propose fee changes taking effect July 1, 2020. However, due to COVID-19 and its impact on the local economy, BDS has decided not to pursue fee changes at this time. These changes will be delayed until further notice, once economic conditions have stabilized.</p>
<p>Raising fees at this time would put undue burden on our customers at a time when many individuals and businesses are struggling. BDS does not want to create additional financial burden at a time of such economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>Good afternoon,<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Bureau of Development Services will now refer to the applicant upload process as &ldquo;Single PDF&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Interim Review.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>BDS pivoted quickly after the Mayor&rsquo;s State of Emergency to start accepting more types of plans via ProjectDox.</strong> Currently, applicants can submit <strong>Process Managed Permits and <a href=""/bds/article/756804"" target=""_blank"">projects in Tiers 1-7</a> via ProjectDox</strong> for limited plan review processing. This includes New Single Family Residences (NSFR) and demolition permits. For the first few months, we referred to this process as &ldquo;Interim Review&rdquo; or &ldquo;ProjectDox Limited.&rdquo; We initially thought the &ldquo;<strong>Interim Review</strong>&rdquo; process would be temporary, but we will not be limiting our intake ability as we move forward, <strong>only expanding our ability to take in more plans for review.</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /> We are now using &ldquo;Single PDF&rdquo; review to refer to the applicant upload process. The terms &ldquo;PDox Limited&rdquo; and &ldquo;Interim Review Process&rdquo; are being retired.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Thank you for your cooperation and help in making this transition!</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /> Please let us know if you have any questions.<br /> BDS Communications</p>
