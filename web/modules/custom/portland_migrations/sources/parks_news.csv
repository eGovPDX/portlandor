<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Nearly 1000 Portland households gain access to a park for the first time; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation invites all to the Grand Opening of Portland&rsquo;s newest park on Saturday, October 21</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces the grand opening of <a href=""/parks/65392"">Luuwit View Park</a>, a 16-acre gem in northeast Portland&rsquo;s Argay Neighborhood.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s newest park features accessible play areas, a water play feature, gardens, paths, sports fields, and much more, all on formerly undeveloped land adjacent to Shaver Elementary School. The park is also close to Parkrose Middle School and Parkrose High School.</p>
<p><em>Luuwit View Park will serve nearly 1000 households which prior to its opening did not previously have ready access to a park. </em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">WHAT: Grand Opening of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s new Luuwit View Park</strong></li>
<li><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">WHEN: Saturday, October 21, 2017; 11am-2pm</strong></li>
<li><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">WHERE: The covered shelter at the new Luuwit View Park, NE 127<sup>th</sup> Avenue and Fremont Street</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Join Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, neighbors, Shaver School students and staff, Parkrose School District Superintendent Dr. Karen Gray, the Parkrose and Argay Neighborhood Associations, family, and friends old and new for the FREE community celebration with family-friendly activities including a Native American blessing and a drumming ceremony, a DJ and breakdancing, a Portland Park Ranger-led youth pledge as kids promise to care for the park, Zumba and exercise activities, skateboarding lessons, live guitar music, light refreshments, and celebrating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After years of dreaming and 15 months of construction, the grand opening of Luuwit View Park represents another major milestone in my time as the Commissioner for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; says City Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Luuwit View Park gives Argay Terrace neighbors a jewel of a space to play, relax, and reflect&ndash;a park which they had been awaiting for more than 40 years. At the same time, we recognize that still, only two of five residents enjoy easy access to a park in this area of east Portland. We will continue to work to close this play gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>LUUWIT VIEW PARK HAS IT ALL</strong></p>
<p>Luuwit View Park features expansive lawns, an accessible playground, walking trails, a misting water play feature, grand views, a youth soccer/sports field, a full-size basketball court, a <a href=""/parks/39846"">Portland Community Garden</a>, and a teen area. The latter includes a climbing structure, two ping-pong tables, a group seating area; and a skateboarding area. The entire teen area will be covered (project completion expected in spring 2018), with colorful sports court surfacing. Other park features include accessible picnic areas, a covered shelter, a restroom, parking, public art, and a fenced off-leash dog area. A multi-use paved trail connects the entire site, and additional soft surface trails meander through the park creating many options for walking loops.</p>
<p>Luuwit is the Upper Cowlitz word referencing the iconic mountain also known as Mt. St. Helens. The park&rsquo;s name helps to honor the indigenous people who have lived on the land since time immemorial, and to recognize the overall history of the area. The City also recognizes the significant farming history of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly 1000 households&ndash;close to 1500 people&ndash;now have access to a wonderful PP&amp;R park for the first time,&rdquo; notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We are moving ahead with our <a href=""/parks/40182"">Parks 2020 Vision</a> to provide a wide variety of high-quality park and recreation opportunities for <em>all</em> Portlanders. The site has been transformed from a vacant space to an amazing gathering spot for every kind of recreation. We thank the literally hundreds of people&ndash;Argay neighbors, our PP&amp;R staff and contractors, and all of our partners&ndash;for their advocacy, input, and tireless efforts to make this amazing park a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The park cost $11.8 million and was funded by <a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks System Development Charges</a> - revenue from development across the City which is intended to support growth&ndash;and not General Fund tax dollars.</p>
<p>Luuwit View Park would not have been possible without the dedication of its Project Advisory Committee and other dedicated neighbors, including students and staff at Shaver Elementary School. They have the City&rsquo;s sincerest thanks.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Green Savoree Racing Promotions, INDYCAR, and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation announce 2018 race at Portland International Raceway</strong></p>
<p>Green Savoree Racing Promotions (GSRP) and INDYCAR announced collaboratively with City of Portland leaders a Verizon IndyCar Series race at Portland International Raceway scheduled for Labor Day weekend, August 31-September 2, 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a young man, I had the opportunity to attend the Indy 500,&rdquo; recalls Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;I remember well the excitement and thrills that INDYCAR racing bring to a city and to race spectators. The return of INDYCAR racing to Portland will give us terrific international exposure, a great deal of revenue, new jobs, and an exciting experience for race fans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very exciting to see INDYCAR racing coming back to the Rose City,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;An event of this magnitude means scores of jobs, $12-$15 million in economic benefits for the city and an exciting weekend of racing with new cars using clean-burning ethanol for fuel. Portland International Raceway continues to be an integral part of the City&rsquo;s recreation portfolio. We will be working closely with neighborhoods to ensure that this is a successful event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new event will serve as round 16 of 17 on the 2018 Verizon IndyCar Series schedule.&nbsp; In conjunction with this announcement, INDYCAR also released its complete 2018 race schedule today. This will be the first professional open-wheel event at Portland International Raceway since the former Champ Car World Series raced on the 1.967-mile, 12-turn permanent road course in 2007.</p>
<p>&ldquo;INDYCAR couldn&rsquo;t be more excited to again race in front of one of our strongest fan bases,&rdquo; said Mark Miles, CEO of Hulman &amp; Company, which owns the Verizon IndyCar Series. &ldquo;Portland International Raceway has produced thrilling road racing throughout Indy car history &ndash; the 1997 finish still stands as the record for the closest finish on a road or street course &ndash; and the timing of our return couldn&rsquo;t be better given the bold new look our cars will have in 2018. We expect this will be a show fans won&rsquo;t want to miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indianapolis-based Green Savoree Racing Promotions (GSRP) will be the owner and operator of the Verizon IndyCar Series race at Portland International Raceway holding all of the commercial rights to the event. This will be one of four INDYCAR weekends GSRP will promote in 2018 including the season-opening Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg (March 9-11), Honda Indy Toronto (July 13-15) and the Honda Indy 200 (July 27-29) at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IndyCar fans in Portland and the Pacific Northwest have waited a long time for this day. Thank you to Mayor Wheeler, Commissioner Fritz and their teams at the City of Portland and INDYCAR for joining together to help us make this happen,&rdquo; said Kevin Savoree, Co-owner, President and Chief Operating Officer of Green Savoree Racing Promotions. &ldquo;Our due diligence proved without any doubt that it was time to bring a race back to Portland International Raceway. With a population of well over two million, the Scarborough research showed the Portland market as the number one target for a Verizon IndyCar Series race. It has a high concentration of IndyCar fans as well as being a popular choice for existing partners already involved with the sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) or Champ Car World Series sanctioned events were held at Portland International Raceway continuously from 1984 to 2007. Portland race winners are a &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo; of INDYCAR. Of the 24 races held, 20 were won by drivers who also earned an INDYCAR championship in their career. Al Unser Jr. won the first race. Currently active Verizon IndyCar Series drivers who competed in the last race held at Portland were Sebastien Bourdais (winner), Will Power (fourth), Simon Pagenaud (eighth) and Graham Rahal (ninth).</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) was recently awarded the National Recreation and Park Association&rsquo;s (NRPA) 2017 Park Champion of the Year Award. The award, which recognizes an employee of a park and recreation agency&rsquo;s exemplary efforts to educate their members of Congress or their staff on the importance of investing in local parks and recreation, was presented this past Wednesday night to PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Som Subedi at the 2017 NRPA Annual Conference in New Orleans.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=657419"" alt="""" width=""221"" height=""294.666666667"" /></p>
<p>Subedi, a former refugee and the coordinator of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/69257"">Parks for New Portlanders</a> program, hosted Grace Stratton of Senator Ron Wyden&rsquo;s office at the Bureau&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/article/651555"">WALK with Refugees and Immigrants event</a> on August 20, 2017, which featured around 1000 participants. A congratulatory letter from Senator Wyden (attached) was read at the award ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation embraces <em>all </em>Portlanders, whether we&rsquo;ve been here for a week or were born and raised here,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I am grateful to the NRPA for recognizing Som for his efforts. As a former refugee working to assist newcomers in an unfamiliar country, he is truly a champion who leads by example. I applaud him for his dedication to equity and inclusion, which are key values in Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s mission now and going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 2017 Park champion award is a great achievement for the Bureau and for Som,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;It is a terrific endorsement of the City of Portland&rsquo;s efforts to make sure there are Parks for New Portlanders, and that we continue to increase our engagement with people new to the Rose City &ndash; and to the USA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This award belongs to all Portlanders, certainly not just me, because we earned it together,&rdquo; says Subedi. &ldquo;I want to thank Parks Commissioner Fritz and Director Abbat&eacute; for trusting in, and for mentoring, a refugee who is committed to equity and inclusion. I am very proud of the compassion, generosity, and welcoming hearts of Portlanders in general, and of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation in particular. I&rsquo;m only inspired to do more work on behalf of all of us who call the Rose City home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>About Air Quality Concerns<br /> </strong>As if the heat wave isn&rsquo;t enough, smoke from forest fires in Canada have swooped into the Portland metro area with obvious visual impact. The impact that is NOT so obvious is how this affects our ability to breathe, work, play, and exercise. The information below is from the State of Oregon&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and is intended to assist you in managing your health until the air clears.</p>
<p>According to the State of Oregon&rsquo;s Department of Environmental Quality the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Portland was 182, in the &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; range, on the morning of Thursday, August 3, at 11am. <a href=""https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;zipcode=97223&amp;submit=Go"">airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.local_city&amp;zipcode=97223&amp;submit=Go</a></p>
<p>The DEQ&rsquo;s &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; air quality index extends between 151 and 200. Their health message: People with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should avoid prolonged or heavy exertions. Everyone else should reduce prolonged or heavy exertion.</p>
<p><strong>How does the AQI work?</strong></p>
<p>Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 represents good air quality with little or no potential to affect public health, while an AQI value over 300 represents air quality so hazardous that everyone may experience serious effects (EPA AQI, 2014).</p>

<p><strong>SAFETY TIPS AND OTHER OPTIONS TO STAY COOL</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R offers you the following tips for a safe summer, PP&amp;R pool and splash pad/fountain information, and <a href=""/parks/73880"">Poet&rsquo;s Beach</a> hours and info below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay hydrated. Drink at least eight glasses of water a day &ndash; at least 8 oz. each, and drink more if you are working, playing or exercising.</li>
<li>Many surfaces found in parks or elsewhere in the city may be hot. These include asphalt, concrete, plastic, metal where the sun is shining, may be hot.&nbsp; Parents should use care when supervising children on play structures, park benches, paths, and elsewhere</li>
<li>Sleep well. Rest is important to the daily recovery of muscles and your body and brain function.</li>
<li>Choose food wisely. A sugar rush is usually followed by sugar burnout, about 30 minutes later. Instead, choose whole food proteins, healthy fats, and natural sources of carbohydrates.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t burn! Remember to pack and USE sunscreen. Apply it frequently, and reapply after swimming.</li>
<li>Cooling centers: people in need of heat relief are encouraged to visit 211info.org or to call 211 for the locations of cooling centers in your area. Other places to get out of the heat include <a href=""/parks/39839"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Community Centers</a>, libraries, shopping malls, and nonprofit organizations.</li>
<li>Our H20 is NOT too low: The Portland Water Bureau assures us that our City&rsquo;s current water use is normal for this time of year. The Bull Run reservoirs have plenty of water to meet the higher summer demand that comes with hot weather. Anyone with questions can call the Portland Water Bureau Water Line at 503-823-7525.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>KEEP COOL IN A PP&amp;R POOL</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R pools offer open play swims, water exercise classes, junior lifeguard training, junior swim training, summer swim teams, and special events. <a href=""/parks/article/489147"">Free swims are offered</a> through August 25, at pools across Portland, though during the heat wave, there may be a wait time at various pools due to high demand. For more information on how to register for swimming lessons or participate in other summer activities, contact the pool in your area or the Aquatics Administration Office at 503-823-5130.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>SPLASH PADS, FOUNTAINS, and POET&rsquo;S BEACH</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation's splash pads and fountains around the city are open to help you stay cool! Cool off through the end of September. <em>Splash pad hours are 11 am to 9 pm; fountain hours mirror park hours. </em>What&rsquo;s the difference? Fountains have chlorination and recirculate water; while water in splash pads drains away &ndash; like running through the sprinklers. <strong>Our list is also available online at </strong><a href=""/parks/splash""><strong>portlandoregon.gov/parks/splash</strong></a><strong> </strong>in English, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Somali, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p><strong>FOUNTAINS YOU CAN PLAY IN<br /> </strong>Note: Fountains are great for playing in, but the water is not for drinking! Like a swimming pool, fountains recirculate treated water. Please help us keep the fountains clean for all to enjoy.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Weather Tips from PP&amp;R</strong></p>
<p>This week, Portland is expecting record-breaking heat. Safety is the top priority of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and we make every effort to keep our classes, camps, and activities running safely during the heat. Excessive temperatures this week may mean that PP&amp;R experiences the following impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R takes extra precautions for camps and campers while outdoors and if needed, we might hold some summer day camps indoors in air conditioned community centers;</li>
<li>Some<strong> </strong><a href=""/parks/61921""><strong>Summer Free For All </strong></a>Concerts or Movies in the Park, or Holladay and Director Park events may be canceled (decided by 1pm on the day of event; if temperatures during event setup or performance time are expected to reach 103 degrees), and/or</li>
<li>The <strong>Free Lunch + Play program</strong> is expected to continue, but may need to end early this week;</li>
<li>PP&amp;R may potentially cancel select outdoor activities on the day of or ahead of time. For example, we expect select afternoon and early evening <strong>Free Fitness in the Park</strong> classes to be canceled.</li>
<li>Some outdoor Senior Recreation and Adaptive &amp; Inclusive activities may be canceled.</li>
<li>Athletic fields - PP&amp;R is informing groups which have permits to athletic fields and facilities confirmed between now and the end of the week that we will provide refunds if they wish to postpone their events for safety&rsquo;s sake. We encourage permittees to use the Oregon School Activities Association (OSAA) heat index guidance in making their decisions, located at <a href=""http://www.osaa.org/heatindex"">osaa.org/heatindex</a>.</li>
<li>Synthetic field closures - turf fields may add fifteen to twenty degrees to the surface level temperature, significantly increasing the risks to individuals participating in permitted activities. Because of this, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">PP&amp;R is temporarily closing all synthetic sport fields.</span>&nbsp;Starting August 1, 2017 at noon and running through the end of the day on Friday, August 4, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all PP&amp;R synthetic fields will be closed.</span> This includes Buckman Field, Dunaway Field, Grant Field, Lents Field, and all turf fields at East Delta Park (known as fields 5-8). PP&amp;R will refund all usage fees for the closure of our synthetic fields.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To find specific information on cancellations, community members should check out the </strong><a href=""/parks/article/142862""><strong>PP&amp;R Inclement Weather page</strong></a> (a few already-determined cancelations are listed at the end of this release).

<p><strong>SPLASH PADS, FOUNTAINS, and POET&rsquo;S BEACH<br /></strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation's splash pads and fountains around the city are open to help you stay cool! Cool off through the end of September. <em>Splash pad hours are 11 am to 9 pm; fountain hours mirror park hours. </em>What&rsquo;s the difference? Fountains have chlorination and recirculate water; while water in splash pads drains away &ndash; like running through the sprinklers. <strong>Our list is also available online at </strong><a href=""/parks/splash""><strong>portlandoregon.gov/parks/splash</strong></a><strong> </strong>in English, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Somali, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p><strong>FOUNTAINS YOU CAN PLAY IN<br /> </strong>Note: Fountains are great for playing in, but the water is not for drinking! Like a swimming pool, fountains recirculate treated water. Please help us keep the fountains clean for all to enjoy.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/63560"">Portland Public Golf</a> and KemperSports will host the <a href=""http://www.colwoodgolf.com/"">Colwood Golf Center</a>&rsquo;s Grand Reopening on Sunday, July 30, 2017. The free, family-friendly event at the popular City of Portland golf course and event site (7313 NE Columbia Boulevard) is free for guests of all ages. Enjoy free driving range balls and rounds of golf, golf lessons; meet our friendly staff, enjoy food, music, and more!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colwood Golf Center is a tremendous site for relaxation and recreation for people of all ages and backgrounds,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And it is a real asset for both the Cully neighborhood and the City as a whole. We are excited to welcome everyone to the grand opening and invite everyone to play anytime at Colwood or any other Portland Public Golf course. We offer fun and challenging amenities and courses for everyone, whether they&rsquo;re an experienced golfer or someone who&rsquo;s never picked up a club. And we make golf affordable for <em>all </em>Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href=""http://portlandparks.org/"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a> (PP&amp;R), in partnership with the Trust for Public Lands, acquired a portion of the former Colwood National Golf Course in 2014, and began redeveloping the property into a unique golf and environmental asset for Portlanders. The driving range and the innovatively designed par-3 course were part of Colwood Golf Center&rsquo;s initial improvements, and have appealed to a wide variety of guests for the past three years.</p>
<p>Since the initial property redesign began, Colwood Golf Center has been continuously making facility improvements. The second phase of this improvement project was completed in the spring of 2017, and included significant investment in infrastructure upgrades; removal of existing site septic systems and construction of an approximately quarter mile sanitary sewer (which increased water quality protection of the Columbia Slough and other adjacent waterways), pedestrian enhancements to the right-of-way that increases safety through new lighting and new sidewalks, the addition of an outdoor event space featuring sweeping views of the new patio, driving range and golf course. The project expanded the Colwood driving range, adding more hitting stalls and a large patio area for outdoor dining, lights, and new grass tees. Colwood&rsquo;s parking lot enjoyed a repaving, new lights for safety, and enhanced landscaping increased the site&rsquo;s aesthetics.</p>
<p>In addition to these recent facility improvements, Colwood Golf Center is home to the Colwood Grill and Columbia Room banquet space. Both segments of the operation feature improved menus and best in class service, as Colwood has become a popular event venue in Northeast Portland.</p>
<p>Colwood Golf Center is also a host facility for the First Tee of Greater Portland, with offices, programming, and dedicated facilities on-site.</p>

Support for the <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=1459"">Kingsley Park Community Garden</a>, the 52<sup>nd</sup> site in Portland&rsquo;s Community Garden system, comes from the Bureau of Environmental Services&rsquo; <a href=""/bes/43077"">Community Watershed Stewardship Program</a>, <a href=""https://wmswcd.org/"">West Multnomah Soil &amp; Water Conservation District</a>, and <a href=""https://www.handsonportland.org/"">Hands on Portland</a>.</p>

<p>The Kingsley Community Garden (pictured) on St. Helens Road (Hwy 30), northwest of Germantown Road, opened on June 3, 2017. The site provides a flat, sunny, nearby space for residents, many of whom live on Linnton&rsquo;s very shady slopes which don&rsquo;t get sufficient sun for growing produce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kingsley is a wonderful place for neighbors to grow and enjoy fresh produce,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Community Gardens are places for people to grow food, where they cultivate community. I&rsquo;m happy that PP&amp;R has another community garden to enrich Portlanders&rsquo; quality of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kingsley garden has a range of plot sizes suitable for growing produce ranging from a small number of tomato plants to a large pumpkin patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a real pleasure to see the robust growth of - and the ever-increasing enthusiasm for - Portland Community Gardens,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Our multi-lingual Gardens staff do a great job in fostering the sense of togetherness that is part of each unique garden, and of engaging people to feel welcome at their neighborhood site. I encourage all Portlanders to sign up for a plot, and to volunteer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kingsley Community Garden also features a 2,000 square-foot habitat garden planted with native plants, which provide shelter and food for all kinds of beneficial insects, birds, and salamanders. The native plants will also boost watershed health by absorbing rainwater during the wet season.</p>
<p>The native plantings at Kingsley Park are part of a larger network of native planting projects in Linnton in the past few years. These plantings help connect wildlife corridors between Forest Park, the Willamette River, and Sauvie Island.</p>
<p>Kingsley Community Garden plots are still available. To sign up for a garden plot, complete a Garden Plot Request Form at&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/52116"">portlandoregon.gov/parks/52116</a>&nbsp; or call the Portland Community Gardens office at 503-823-1612 for assistance.</p>
<p>The Portland Community Gardens program has provided gardening opportunities for the physical and social benefit of the people and neighborhoods of Portland since 1975. With the addition of Kingsley, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation now manages 52 community gardens located throughout the city. Portland Community Gardens are developed and operated by volunteers and PP&amp;R staff, offering a variety of activities.</p>

<p>The efforts by the partners aim to enhance Portland&rsquo;s iconic Forest Park, and to decrease instances of litter, dog waste, damage to vegetation, and trees and trail erosion by providing educational opportunities - and applying Leave No Trace principles.<br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WHAT: Get involved with caring for Forest Park</strong></li>
<li><strong>WHERE: Leif Erikson trailhead on NW Thurman and 29<sup>th Avenue</sup>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>WHEN: Friday, June 23, 2017. 10am-2pm</strong></li>
<li><strong>WHY: Join Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the No Ivy League, Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, Forest Park Conservancy, and other friends as we come together to learn how to best preserve and enhance our treasured Forest Park.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Other events during the Legacy Week will be posted at <a href=""https://lnt.org/hot-spot-forest-park"">lnt.org/hot-spot-forest-park</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The partnership with Leave No Trace helps Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff - and all park visitors - to care for Forest Park,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;All park visitors must realize&nbsp;how we all impact our natural areas, and learn more ways to minimize our impacts. Together, we will protect our cherished Forest Park for current and future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legacy Week in Forest Park features <a href=""https://lnt.org/about"">Leave No Trace</a> (LNT) personnel who help identify areas of need, and partner with Rangers, other PP&amp;R staff, and volunteers to put solutions and preventative measures in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;We are thrilled to work with the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics to help raise awareness about the need to care for our natural areas and resources,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The use of LNT ethics by Portland Park Rangers and other staff will help educate Portlanders and enhance their enjoyment and preservation of our beautiful and irreplaceable natural landscapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Leave No Trace principles include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Trash your Trash</strong></p>
<p>Put litter&mdash;even crumbs, peels and cores&mdash; in garbage bags and carry it home or throw it in trash receptacles. Extra food, even apple cores and banana peels can do great damage to wildlife. Did you know it takes up to two years for orange or banana peels to decompose in nature; more than 10 years for plastic bags and more than 80 years for aluminum cans to decompose?</p>
<p><strong>2. Dog Dogma</strong></p>
<p>Use a plastic bag to pack out your dog&rsquo;s poop to a garbage can. Dog waste can be harmful to the natural environment and can cause the spread of invasive species.</p>
<p><strong>3. Take Only Pictures. Leave Only Footprints</strong></p>
<p>According to U.S. state and national park services, Americans logged 11 billion visits to public lands last year. If we all took a memento from nature during those visits, the landscape would change. Fill the memory card on your camera rather than your pockets and leave nature as you found it for others to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keep Wildlife Wild</strong></p>
<p>Human food is unhealthy for all wildlife and feeding them can have unfortunate consequences such as drawing them to people and roads and making them sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cumulative impact of so many people enjoying an iconic hiking trail such as the Wildwood can have a negative effect,&rdquo; according to Andy Mossey, a Leave No Trace Traveling Trainer. &ldquo;In most cases, the land impact isn&rsquo;t due to a malicious intent to harm nature and wildlife. Instead, it&rsquo;s simply lack of Leave No Trace education and practices.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This partnership is the result of a <a href=""http://innovate.portlandoregon.gov/"">City of Portland innovation grant</a> to promote equity and opportunities in city government, our community, and to improve parks, recreation, and customer service. Forest Park was chosen as a focus for promoting responsible recreation and site-specific education.&nbsp; Portland Park Rangers now have three LNT Master Educators on staff: Portland Park Ranger Supervisor Vicente Harrison, and Park Rangers Kayla Miles and Damir Dukic.</p>
<p><strong>About Leave No Trace</strong><br /> The Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics in a national nonprofit organization that protects the outdoors by teaching people how to enjoy it responsibly. Their Subaru/Leave No Trace Traveling Trainers are mobile teams of educators that visit 48 states every year delivering Leave No Trace programs such as Hot Spots to over 15 million people.

<p>The track is now reopen after a closure of about a year which came after extensive public outreach and involvement. Duniway Park has had a popular track since the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Under Armour announced plans in&nbsp;early July 2015 to move forward with a significant partnership to enhance&nbsp;recreational opportunities for Portlanders.

<p>&ldquo;We have tremendous needs in our parks system,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;PP&amp;R relies on public-private partnership when it comes to strengthening neighborhood livability.

<p>Today, fencing is being removed at Duniway Park as major construction is complete on the track and field improvements. Some field painting is still pending, but all facilities are usable. Please heed contractors&rsquo; instructions as they finalize striping and painting.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that all grass playing fields (for sports such as soccer, lacrosse, etc.) as well as baseball and softball <strong>fields citywide are now open</strong> for all permitted games, practices, and drop-in play as of Tuesday, May 23, 2017.

<p><em>Photo: PP&amp;R crews have worked extensively to get playing fields across Portland back in shape despite record-setting rain this winter and spring. In photo: Athletic Field Supervisor Shawn Lindsey, pictured at east Portland&rsquo;s Walker Stadium (in Lents Park). Lindsey is quick to give credit to his front-line staff for their exceptional efforts.</em></p>
<p>The Bureau appreciates the public understanding that with the record-setting wet conditions which persisted citywide for weeks, games, practices and drop-in play at PP&amp;R fields had to be suspended. The time off allowed the saturated soil to slowly drain, prevented damage to the turf which would have impacted play throughout the busy summer season, and restricted play on potentially unsafe playing surfaces. Crews were unable to mow grass when the turf was soaked, as mowers would have dug ruts into the turf and as, Portland homeowners know from taking care of their own lawns, the wet grass would have resisted being cut.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R Sports Management and the Bureau&rsquo;s turf management divisions thank Portlanders for their patience and welcome the return of sunny, warm weather.&nbsp; They remind field users of the rules designed around safety, and ask you to please follow them when checking your game site prior to play, particularly after future heavy rains:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is standing water or visible mud on a field, do not play.</li>
<li>If you step on your field and sink down an inch or more, do not play.</li>
<li>Please do not try to remove any water, dirt or mud from fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>PP&amp;R understands that the field closures have been inconvenient for some. However, safety of all park visitors is PP&amp;R&rsquo;s top priority. Also, any damage inflicted on playing surfaces this spring can result in ongoing safety issues during the peak summer season, as well as increased costs for repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>Please note: questions about Portland Public School (PPS) fields should be directed to the school district; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation does not handle closures for PPS fields.</p>

The new garden will convert 30,000 square feet of unused land into a garden that will provide space for 50 or more families to grow food.</p>
<p><a href=""http://csd28j.org/"">Centennial School District</a> received funding from <a href=""http://emswcd.org/"">East Multnomah Soil &amp; Water Conservation District</a> to construct the garden. These funds were matched by support from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and a donation from the Richard and Helen Phillips Charitable Fund in support of PPR&rsquo;s efforts to bring healthy, fresh food to Portland&rsquo;s neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Construction on the garden, the 53<sup>rd</sup> in the Portland Community Gardens system, is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2017. Garden plots will available starting in the Fall of 2017. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will operate the site as an opportunity for the Centennial community to grow healthy, fresh produce right in their neighborhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that all Portland communities have access to garden plots that provide a place to grow fresh, healthy foods,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Bilingual staff who speak Spanish and Russian, will involve non-English speaking neighbors and foster community with ongoing classes, advice, and community gatherings. Community Gardens are about community and family, for all ages, and ongoing partnership with neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lynch Wood is the third community garden project partnership between Centennial School District and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. The two partners opened Oliver-Parklane and Centennial Park Community Gardens in 2013, also located on school property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Community Gardens offer lasting physical and social benefits,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;They allow for families to enjoy their own healthy, organic produce, regardless of language or economic status.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m proud we&rsquo;ve continued to expand the Portland Community Gardens program, and encourage all neighbors to sign up for a plot near them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Centennial School District and Lynch Wood Elementary School would like to hear from the neighborhood their ideas and questions about the new garden.&nbsp; Join PP&amp;R and the District to hear about the new project, ask questions, and offer any feedback or suggestions during the <strong>Family Fun Night, Friday, May 19, at Lynch Wood Elementary School from 5:30-7:30.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>The Portland Community Gardens program has provided gardening opportunities for the physical and social benefit of the people and neighborhoods of Portland since 1975.

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that all grass playing fields (for sports such as soccer, lacrosse, etc.) as well as baseball and softball fields EAST of the Willamette River are now open for practices, games, and drop-in play as of Monday, May 1, 2017.</p>
<p><em>Photo: Unplayable field conditions persist at parts of Gabriel Park.</em></p>
<p>The Bureau appreciates the public understanding that with the continued wet and saturated conditions citywide, practices and drop-in play at fields which are still impacted by wet conditions - mostly on the west side of the river - may negatively impact the turf throughout the year. Therefore, for fields west of the Willamette River, only games previously scheduled via a permit with the PP&amp;R Customer Service Center will be held until further notice.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will re-evaluate field conditions citywide daily until staff determine all areas can reopen for games and practices. The next decision may be made on Thursday morning, May 4, 2017.</p>
<p>Please note that due to continued unplayable conditions two playing fields at Gabriel Park (known as fields 2 and 3) remain closed for ALL activities at this time.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R sports management and the Bureau&rsquo;s turf management divisions have been inspecting fields citywide after playing surfaces became impacted by weather-related conditions such as standing water, mud, and long grass (some of which can&rsquo;t yet be mowed because the ground is too soft). &nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has rules for permit-holders designed around safety. To those people, teams and leagues who have reserved fields for games, we remind you to please follow these rules when checking your game site prior to play:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is standing water or visible mud on a field, do not play.</li>
<li>If you step on your field and sink down an inch or more, do not play.</li>
<li>Please do not try to remove any water, dirt or mud from fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>PP&amp;R understands that the field closures are or have been inconvenient for some. However, safety of all park visitors is PP&amp;R&rsquo;s top priority. Also, any damage inflicted on playing surfaces this spring can result in ongoing safety issues during the peak summer season, as well as increased costs for repair and maintenance. PP&amp;R will re-evaluate field conditions citywide daily. Please note: questions about Portland Public School (PPS) fields should be directed to the school district; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation does not handle closures for PPS fields.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/636959

<p>All are welcome to join community partners and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation at the third annual Cambodian/Lao/Thai/Burmese New Year in the Park. Four vibrant Southeast Asian cultures join together for a day full of food, music, dance and games on Saturday, April 29, 2017. The event was founded by a Cambodian refugee, <a href=""#Saron"">Saron Khut</a>, and is the largest local event of its kind. Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz will join other special guests, including Doug Fasching and Anne Lindsay of the Central Northeast Neighborhood Coalition, which sponsored one of the grants which is funding the event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the integration of refugee and immigrants into our community, Portland is increasingly richer and culturally diverse,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Many of these families have faced &ndash; and continue to face - tremendous challenges. New Year in the Park is an opportunity to celebrate the cultures of Southeast Asia, and to reaffirm that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is inclusive and a safe place for everyone. That goes for all neighbors, whether they&rsquo;ve been in Portland for a week or for their entire lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cambodian, Laotian, Thai and Burmese cultures all celebrate New Year each April, but historically, Portland&rsquo;s communities always held separate celebrations. Now, for the third straight year, the different but equally fascinating languages and cultures are coming together to foster greater understanding and appreciation of these proud communities. The New Year is the most important celebrations in many Southeast Asian cultures. More than 10,000 people attended 2016&rsquo;s New Year in the Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The multicultural New Year celebration is another important step towards the inclusion of all Portlanders in enjoying our parks and natural areas,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We want all Portlanders, regardless of culture, background, ethnicity or gender to know that the parks belong to you. We will continue to work hard to remove or reduce barriers to access and participation for everyone, including communities of color, people with disabilities, or recent immigrants.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><strong><a name=""Saron""></a><br />Founded by a Refugee</strong></h2>
<p>New Year in the Park founder Saron Khut lived through the brutal reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, whose leaders slaughtered more than 1 million victims. Khut has been a Portlander and a business owner for more than 35 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so happy to be in America, even though I knew nothing about the country, the language, the culture,&rdquo; Khut recalls of coming to the Rose City. &ldquo;As I grew up in Portland I tried to assimilate as much as I could, but I still valued the culture of my homeland. I want my children to realize who and where they come from. That&rsquo;s why it is so special to partner with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, to tie my current home and city to my native land and culture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is special to see the New Year in the Park celebration return for its third year,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And to be a part of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s efforts to help newcomers to Portland realize the opportunities available to them, as well as to realize their own potential. Immigrant communities need to feel safe, to learn that they are welcome in public spaces &ndash; this is not something that always comes naturally to people from other countries. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s efforts towards inclusion are vital, and the Bureau&rsquo;s support has been outstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PP&amp;R is helping us realize the dream of having a celebration this diverse, this large, and this fun, for the third straight year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong> <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT 2018 WASHINGTON PARK SHUTTLE HOURS ARE 9:30AM-7PM. THE SHUTTLE IS RUNNING ON WEEKENDS THROUGH APRIL; AND BEGINS DAILY SERVICE THROUGH THE SUMMER FROM MAY 1-SEPTEMBER 30.</strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><a href=""http://explorewashingtonpark.org/"">Washington Park&rsquo;s</a> free shuttle returns on Saturday, April 1, 2017. The start of shuttle service coincides with the April 2 Grand Opening of the Portland Japanese Garden&rsquo;s new Cultural Crossing. The Washington Park shuttle runs to all major park attractions, with weekend service starting April 1, and daily service May 1.</p>
<p>The shuttle carried a record 128,000 people in 2016 on its 30-minute loop through Washington Park, leading to a decrease of over 12,800 car trips. 2017 will see a number of improvements to the shuttle service, including lower wait times and expanded daily service for the months of May and September (part of peak visitor season in the park).</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=634205"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>The shuttle connects visitors to all the world-class attractions in Washington Park, as well as to <a href=""http://trimet.org/"">TriMet&rsquo;s</a> MAX Red and Blue lines, shuttles arrive every 15 minutes at each of the stops with an additional bus being added to help ensure consistent service and to expand passenger capacity. All shuttles are ADA accessible. Riding the shuttle is even more appealing this year due to the ongoing reservoir project in the park, which impacts parking and access for private cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The free shuttle is a fun and easy way to visit the Japanese Garden and the rest of Washington Park,&rdquo; says Portland Japanese Gardens Deputy Director Cynthia Haruyama. &ldquo;Let someone else do the driving and worry about parking!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re thrilled that the shuttle service is starting a month earlier this year just in time for visitors coming to see our&nbsp;<em>Cultural Crossing</em>&nbsp;expansion and for the Rose Garden&rsquo;s 100<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;anniversary this summer.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Photo: The free Washington Park shuttle runs throughout the popular park April-September, and helps the nearly 3 million visitors to iconic Washington Park get around smoothly and easily.</em></p>
<p>Record attendance is expected this summer season with the opening of the Oregon Zoo&rsquo;s Education Center and Portland Japanese Garden&rsquo;s Cultural Crossing. Visitors are encouraged to take MAX or rideshare service to Washington Park, as construction on Portland Water Bureau&rsquo;s Washington Park Reservoir Improvement Project will continue throughout 2017, resulting in the loss of parking capacity and street closures that will make parking near the Portland Japanese Gardens limited.</p>
<p><strong>Service Beginning April 1, 2017</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Weekends only through end of April, daily service beginning in May</li>
<li>15 minutes between buses</li>
<li>Operating 9:00 a.m. &ndash; 7:00 p.m.</li>

<p>Westmoreland Park playing fields are now open for permitted games only. As weather and field conditions improve, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation hopes to again reopen all citywide fields for practices and drop-in play.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>UPDATE FOR MONDAY, APRIL 3, 2017</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that MOST grass playing fields (for sports such as soccer, lacrosse, etc.) as well as baseball and softball fields across the City are reopen for permitted games (and only games) starting on Monday, April 3, 2017. Please note that due to continued unplayable conditions</p>
<p>Two playing fields at Gabriel Park (known as fields 2 and 3) remain closed at this time, as do all fields at Westmoreland Park. The Bureau appreciates the public understanding that with the continued wet and saturated conditions citywide, practices may impact the turf even more than games. Therefore, only games previously scheduled via a permit with the PP&amp;R Customer Service Center will be held until further notice.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will re-evaluate field conditions citywide daily until staff determine all areas can reopen for games and practices.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R sports management and the Bureau&rsquo;s turf management divisions have been inspecting fields citywide after playing surfaces became impacted by weather-related conditions such as standing water, mud, and long grass (some of which can&rsquo;t yet be mowed because the ground is too soft). &nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has rules for permit-holders designed around safety. To those people, teams and leagues who have reserved fields for games, we remind you to please follow these rules when checking your game site prior to play:</p>

<li>If there is standing water or visible mud on a field, do not play.</li>
<li>If you step on your field and sink down an inch or more, do not play.</li>
<li>Please do not try to remove any water, dirt or mud from fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>PP&amp;R understands that the field closures are and have been inconvenient for some. However, safety of all park visitors is PP&amp;R&rsquo;s top priority.

<p><strong>UPDATE FOR MARCH 31, 2017</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that grass playing fields (for sports such as soccer, lacrosse, etc.) as well as baseball and softball fields on the east side of the City will reopen for permitted games (and only games) starting on Saturday, April 1, 2017. Please note that due to continued unplayable conditions elsewhere, fields at Westmoreland Park and all sites west of the Willamette River remain closed at this time. The Bureau appreciates the public understanding that with the continued wet and saturated conditions citywide, practices may impact the turf even more than games. Therefore, only games previously scheduled via a permit with the PP&amp;R Customer Service Center will be held this weekend.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will reevaluate field conditions citywide on Monday, April 3.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R sports management and the Bureau&rsquo;s turf management divisions have inspected fields citywide, and found that surfaces on Portland&rsquo;s west side remain impacted by weather-related conditions such as standing water, mud, and long grass (which can&rsquo;t yet be mowed because the ground is too soft). &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>POSTED MARCH 27, 2017</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has closed all city-owned athletic and ballfields until at least Friday, March 31, 2017, due to safety concerns and saturated conditions related to continued rain. This closure impacts grass fields at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites, and events which PP&amp;R had permitted at Portland Public Schools facilities. On Friday, March 31, PP&amp;R will re-evaluate the grass fields and make a determination on if they can be reopened, or if the closures need to be extended - with user safety in mind. The citywide closure does NOT impact synthetic turf fields, which are designed for all-weather play.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=633807"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p><em>Photo: Unplayable conditions at Westmoreland Park's soccer field on Monday, March 27, 2017.</em></p>
<p>Sustained rains and wet conditions across the city have left many PP&amp;R athletic fields with standing water, mud, slippery turf, and other poor conditions that may impact athletes&rsquo; safety. The heavy and seemingly unending rain has also hampered the ability for PP&amp;R maintenance crews to care for the fields. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation turf experts stressed the importance of preserving the grass at this time of the year, noting that damage inflicted now will be much harder to repair later in the year when more users are expected to use the fields.</p>
<p>All people who have been granted permits for events on PP&amp;R athletic and ball fields will have their money refunded. Fields will also be closed for drop-in use. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation makes safety its top priority, though we understand some athletes will be disappointed by the bureau&rsquo;s need to close the fields. Similar closures impacted PP&amp;R grass fields in March and October, 2016.</p>

<p>The floating portion of the Eastbank Esplanade is now <strong>reopen</strong> for use by cyclists, walkers, runners, and all other visitors. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) staff have continuously assessed the walkway, which can rise to an unsafe angle during periods of extremely high water on the Willamette River, since the time the Bureau had to close it on March 25, 2017. Today staff determined the path can be reopened, and took down safety fences at around 11:30am.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R may have to close this section of the popular path once again if the river rises to an unsuitably high angle again, due to more rain, snowmelt, or other conditions wrought by Mother Nature.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) -</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is temporarily closing the floating portion of the Eastbank Esplanade due to extremely high Willamette River water levels. PP&amp;R has been carefully monitoring this section of the popular riverside trail, located on the east side of the Willamette, over the past few days. During periods of very high water, when the river reaches approximately 17.5 feet, the ramps rise to an angle determined to be potentially unsafe for people on bikes, on foot, and for those using mobility devices.&nbsp;This situation has occurred in the past during rare, extremely high river elevations (most recently in May of 2011). &nbsp;</p>
<p>The floating section of the Esplanade is tethered to the solid riverbank between the Steel Bridge to the north and past the Burnside Bridge to the south.&nbsp;Staff are installing warning signs (attached) to notify cyclists, runners and walkers. Signs will be located on the Esplanade, both ahead of the impacted areas and at the points of closure.</p>
<p>The closure will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time - until river conditions allow for safe travel on the impacted section of walkway.. Staff are monitoring conditions regularly and will reopen the area as soon as it is determined to be safe. Commuters, walkers, cyclists, etc., should use street alternatives.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/633708

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) seeks community input as the Bureau crafts a <a href=""/parks/70954"">new Master Plan</a> to guide the future of iconic Washington Park, 450 acres of beautiful gardens and natural areas. <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?propertyid=841&amp;action=viewpark"">Washington Park</a> is home to many of the City&rsquo;s key attractions, including the International Rose Test Garden, Oregon Zoo, Portland Japanese Garden, and Hoyt Arboretum. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is in the process of planning the vision of this iconic park by updating its 1981 Master Plan.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R is extensively engaging the community in the Master Plan process. The Bureau began work by conducting a public survey both in the park and on-line to see what improvements and services Portlanders most want to see in Washington Park. Additional parking and food services, improved trail connectivity to popular park attractions, and making paths more suitable for cycling were among the most recurring comments. The project team considered these and other community input and the findings from the <a href=""https://issuu.com/portlandparks/docs/wpmpu_technical_investigation___pub/1?ff=true&amp;e=3709716/41532144"">technical investigation</a> (a summary of findings on how people use Washington Park) when developing Master Plan concepts for consideration.</p>
<p>Community members can help shape the future of Washington Park by reviewing the Master Plan concepts and providing comments. This is the time for community members to make their mark on the future of Washington Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to work with the community to refresh the vision for Washington Park for the next 25 years,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The goal of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is to enhance the experience for all visitors and to attract new visitors by improving how people access and move through the park, adding needed services, and linking park experiences, while honoring its history and beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Community members are invited to submit their comments in-person or online to review the concepts and provide input.</p>
<p><strong>Party in the Park</strong><br /><strong>Saturday, April 8, 2017</strong><br />10:00am &ndash; 2:00pm;&nbsp;Presentations at 10:30am and 12:30pm<br />World Forestry Center, Cheatham Hall<br /><em><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/s7dj26oWn7o"">4033 SW Canyon Road,&nbsp;Portland, Oregon 97221</a></em></p>

<p>&ldquo;While Pioneer Courthouse Square is &lsquo;Portland&rsquo;s Living Room&rsquo;, Washington Park is known as our city&rsquo;s back yard,&rdquo; notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;With more than three million visitors each year, Washington Park is a jewel in the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation system. And the input of Portlanders is key in helping us formulate the vision of the park for the coming decades. Much has changed since the original Master Plan was crafted in 1981. We want to make sure that Washington Park is a place for recreation, inspiration, and relaxation for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The updated Master Plan is expected to be completed in Winter 2017. For more information on this project, please visit&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/waparkmasterplan"">portlandoregon.gov/parks/waparkmasterplan</a>.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>El programa &ldquo;Produce for People&rdquo; (Productos agr&iacute;colas para la gente, en espa&ntilde;ol) de los <a href=""/parks/39846"">Huertos comunitarios de Portland</a> don&oacute; m&aacute;s de 31,500 libras de productos agr&iacute;colas nutritivos, org&aacute;nicos y cultivados localmente a organizaciones de ayuda contra el hambre de Portland el a&ntilde;o pasado. Los hortelanos de 48 Huertos comunitarios de Portland de todas partes de la ciudad participaron en el 2016.</p>

<p><em>En foto: Jardineros de NE 72nd Ave.Community Garden en el celebraci&oacute;n de abrir el sitio de crecer de ""Produce for People.""</em></p>
<p>El Departamento de parques y recreaci&oacute;n de Portland (PP&amp;R, por sus siglas en ingl&eacute;s) cre&oacute; &ldquo;<a href=""/parks/65818"">Produce for People</a>&rdquo; en 1995 como un esfuerzo de la comunidad en el que los hortelanos comunitarios cultivan comida fresca y ayudan a dar de comer a los necesitados. Desde su desarrollo, el programa ha donado casi 300,000 libras de comida a las organizaciones de Portland de ayuda contra el hambre. &nbsp;</p>
<p>El programa &ldquo;Produce for People&rdquo; ofrece recursos y motivaci&oacute;n para que los hortelanos comunitarios conecten con residentes fuera de sus huertos para compartir la abundancia de sus labores. En cada huerto, los l&iacute;deres coordinan con los participantes para decidir cu&aacute;les productos se cultivar&aacute;n para ser donados, d&oacute;nde ser&aacute;n donados y establecen un horario regular para recoger y entregar los alimentos.</p>
<p>Durante la temporada de cultivo de 2016, se desarroll&oacute; y construy&oacute; un nuevo parterre para &ldquo;Produce for People&rdquo; en el Huerto comunitario de NE 72<sup>nd&nbsp;</sup>Ave., en lo que ser&aacute; <a href=""/parks/article/591668"">Thomas Cully Park</a>. El equipo de liderazgo del jard&iacute;n y m&aacute;s de la mitad de los jardineros comunitarios del sitio hablan espa&ntilde;ol como su idioma principal. Con la comunidad biling&uuml;e y el apoyo del personal de PP&amp;R, fueron capaces de colaborar con sus co-jardineros de habla inglesa para convertir una zona com&uacute;n previamente sin uso en una parcela de jard&iacute;n nuevo. Todo el jard&iacute;n comunitario ser&aacute; capaz de producir alimentos en esta parcela exclusivamente para la donaci&oacute;n.</p>
<p>Los hortelanos de NE 72<sup>nd </sup>Ave. designaron a <a href=""http://www.emoregon.org/NE_food_program.php"">Northeast Emergency Food Program</a> (el Programa de ayuda alimenticia de emergencia del noreste, en espa&ntilde;ol) como el beneficiario de sus productos donados.</p>
<p>La parcela de 400 pies cuadrados permitir&aacute; el cultivo de una abundancia de productos alimenticios frescos, sanos y org&aacute;nicos esta primavera. El co-gerente del Huerto comunitario Cully de PP&amp;R, Federico Ram&iacute;rez, orienta a los hortelanos comunitarios sobre c&oacute;mo establecer su programa de &ldquo;Produce for People&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Es un buen principio para el jard&iacute;n y esta comunidad Latina,&rdquo; se&ntilde;ala Ram&iacute;rez. &ldquo;Para involucrarnos m&aacute;s con las comunidades que ya est&aacute;n trabajando en este esfuerzo, compartir en la cosecha y aprender de c&oacute;mo ser m&aacute;s bondadosos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Este ejemplo decontribuciones multiculturales y dirigidas por la comunidad es algo que verdaderamente merece ser celebrado&rdquo;, dice la Comisionada de los parques de Portland, Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Cuando los vecinos trabajan para ayudar a su pr&oacute;jimo, todos ganamos. Ofrecemos nuestro agradecimiento sincero a todas las personas que donaron sus cultivos por sus esfuerzos abnegados y ben&eacute;volos&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuestros Huertos comunitarios son un programa destacado del Departamento de parques y recreaci&oacute;n de Portland, y ayudan a hacer que nuestra ciudad sea el lugar sostenible y sano que es,&rdquo; subray&oacute; el Director de PP&amp;R, Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Estoy sumamente agradecido a todos los hortelanos comunitarios por su trabajo duro y esp&iacute;ritu de generosidad, y estoy muy orgulloso de todo el personal de los Huertos comunitarios de PP&amp;R y de nuestros m&aacute;s de 50 Huertos comunitarios en toda la ciudad&rdquo;.</p>
<p>El programa &ldquo;Produce for People&rdquo; simult&aacute;neamente permite que las personas que trabajan en los huertos comunitarios reduzcan el desperdicio de productos agr&iacute;colas perecederos que no puedan consumir de forma inmediata y que formen nuevos nexos con otros miembros de su comunidad. La capacidad de estos cultivadores de sembrar una variedad amplia de vegetales y hierbas frescos es un beneficio &uacute;nico del programa, ya que ofrece una diversidad m&aacute;s grande de recursos culinarios a comunidades que enfrentan una escasez de alimentos.</p>

<p><a href=""/parks/39846"">Portland Community Gardens&rsquo;</a> Produce for People program donated more than 31,500 pounds of fresh, nutritious, organic, locally grown produce to Portland&rsquo;s hunger relief agencies this past year. Gardeners from 48 Portland Community Gardens across Portland participated in 2016.</p>

<p><em>Photo: Community gardeners at the groundbreaking/work party for NE 72nd Ave. Community Garden's Produce for People plot.</em></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) created <a href=""/parks/65818"">Produce for People</a> in 1995 as a grassroots effort in which community gardeners grow fresh food and help fulfill the needs of the hungry.&nbsp; Since it first blossomed, the program has donated nearly 300,000 pounds of food to Portland hunger relief agencies.</p>
<p>The Produce for People program provides resources and motivation for community gardeners to connect with people outside the garden to share their bounty. At each garden, leaders will organize their gardeners to decide what to grow for donation, where the produce will be donated, and establish regular pick-up and delivery times.</p>
<p>The 2016 growing season saw the development and construction of a new Produce for People garden bed at the NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Ave. Community Garden, in the future <a href=""/parks/article/591668"">Thomas Cully Park</a>. The garden leadership team and more than half of the community gardeners at the site speak Spanish as their primary language. With bilingual community and PP&amp;R staff support, they were able to collaborate with their English speaking co-gardeners to convert a previously unused common area into a new garden plot. The entire community garden will be able to produce food on this plot exclusively for donation. The NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Ave. gardeners designated the <a href=""http://www.emoregon.org/NE_food_program.php"">Northeast Emergency Food Program</a> to receive their donated produce.</p>
<p>The 400 square-foot garden plot will allow the gardeners to grow an abundance of fresh, healthy, organic produce this spring. Federico Ramirez, co-manager at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Cully Community Garden, is mentoring NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Ave. community gardeners on setting up their Produce for People program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Es un buen principio para el jard&iacute;n y esta comunidad Latina,&rdquo; says Ramirez. &ldquo;Para involucrarnos m&aacute;s con las comunidades que ya est&aacute;n trabajando en este esfuerzo, compartir en la cosecha y aprender de c&oacute;mo ser m&aacute;s bondadosos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;It is a good beginning for this garden and this Latino community,&rdquo; says Ramirez, co-manager at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Cully Community Garden. &ldquo;To be more involved with the communities that are already working in this effort, to share the harvest and to continue learning ways to have an open heart to those less fortunate than ourselves.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This example of multicultural, community-led contributions is truly something worth celebrating,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;When neighbors work to help neighbors, we are all better off. Our sincere thanks to all of the gardeners who donated produce for their selfness and gracious efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Portland Community Gardens are a hallmark program of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and they help make Portland the sustainable, healthy city that it is,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;I am tremendously thankful for the hard work and giving spirit shown by the community gardeners, and I&rsquo;m very proud of all our PP&amp;R Community Gardens staff for their continued efforts to steward this invaluable program and all of our 50+ Portland Community Gardens citywide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Produce for People program simultaneously allows gardeners to cut down on wasting perishable produce they aren&rsquo;t able to immediately consume, and to make new connections with members of their community. The ability of gardeners to produce a wide variety of vegetables as well as fresh herbs is a unique benefit of the program as it provides a greater diversity of culinary resources to communities experiencing food scarcity.&nbsp;</p>

It was in February, 100 years ago, that Portland received official notice the American Rose Society had selected the city as the location for the national test garden, in part to help preserve European roses threatened by World War I. Now, a century later, the renowned site is the oldest continuously operating public rose test garden in the United States. Around 700,000 visitors come to the world-famous rose garden each year. The garden will remain open during construction.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT: Groundbreaking celebration for Rose Garden accessibility improvements</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN: Friday, February 24, 2017, 1pm-2pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE: Int&rsquo;l Rose Test Garden store, 400 SW Kingston</strong></p>
<p>Free and open to all guests, including children. Speakers include Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, who will welcome friends, staff and partners.</p>
<p>The IRTG will benefit from a <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a> project to improve accessibility from the nearby parking areas into and near the site. The project will remove ADA accessibility barriers from the main Garden promenade and improve the connection to the parking lot, allowing all visitors to enjoy one of the top free attractions in Oregon. Construction starts in March 2017 and is expected to be substantially complete by this coming June.</p>
<p class=""Default"">The project includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving slopes and grading</li>
<li>Adding new handrails</li>
<li>Removing stairs leading into and out of the area on the main promenade by the Beach Memorial Fountain</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Washington Park&rsquo;s International Rose Test Garden has been a centerpiece of our City for 100 years,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Entering the next century with greater accessibility for all is an equitable and appropriate way to celebrate one of the Rose City&rsquo;s signature attractions. Our hope for the Centennial Year is that our citizens and visitors see this as a chance to reignite their love for the garden or to visit for the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The International Rose Test Garden is a source of pride for all of us at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We are proud to be the steward of this world-renowned jewel and look forward to the next 100 years. We give many thanks to the many partners and volunteers who have given countless hours to develop and maintain the gardens since its beginnings in 1917.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>CELEBRATE 100 YEARS OF ROSES</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and dedicated partners in the rose community are celebrating 100 years of Portland roses in Washington Park with commemorative events throughout the year, culminating in a Community Celebration Day on Saturday, August 26. This free, fun and large public celebration will include family-friendly activities staged among the roses during the day, ending with an evening concert in the adjacent Int&rsquo;l Rose Test Garden amphitheater.&nbsp; It will be an opportunity for all Portlanders to celebrate a signature attraction which helps define the Rose City.</p>
<p>Other garden enhancements include the coming installation of interpretive signs and a monument to honor the garden curators of the past 100 years, scheduled for installation in September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PP&amp;R rose gardens have been my &lsquo;office&rsquo; for 29 years,&rdquo; says International Rose Test Garden Curator Harry Landers. &ldquo;Through that time and continuing today, I'm especially proud to showcase the garden&rsquo;s unique role in Portland's history and what it offers today to visitors from all around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Landers will spearhead the planting rows of a special yellow centennial rose, currently in the process of being named by the Friends of the Washington Park International Rose Test Garden, and which will be available for sale to the public. The Friends formed to preserve and enhance the rose garden as a heritage resource and destination for the Portland community and visitors from around the world.&nbsp; Hundreds of Friends volunteers care for the roses through pruning and deadheading, as well as provide tours. Around 700,000 visitors come to the world-famous rose garden each year.&nbsp; The Friends will be hosting a ticketed Wine and Roses Gala as a fundraiser for the garden in August.&nbsp; PP&amp;R thanks the Portland Rose Society, Royal Rosarians and Rose Festival Association for their partnerships, which are represented via features within the grounds. These advocates have a key role as historic contributors to the IRTG&rsquo;s development, as well as to the cultivation of Portland&rsquo;s noted passion for roses.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the IRTG is to serve as a testing ground for new rose varieties (hence the word &ldquo;test&rdquo; in the garden&rsquo;s formal name!) However, the garden&rsquo;s original creation served two significant historic purposes &ndash; a sanctuary for roses during World War I that European hybridists feared might be wiped out in the bombings, as well as a crown to Portland&rsquo;s campaign in the early 1900s to secure the reputation as the City of Roses. Over the last 100 years, millions of visitors from every corner of the globe have contributed their own stories to the garden&rsquo;s history, and 2017 will be a year to celebrate it all. More history about the Int&rsquo;l Rose Test Garden is available <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=1113"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Take public transit to Washington Park</strong></p>
<p>Please note that reservoir construction has significantly reduced parking in and around Washington Park. Visitors are encouraged to take MAX to the Washington Park stop. Starting in April, the free Washington Park free shuttle runs through the park each weekend, including a stop at the IRTG. The shuttle then runs seven days a week from May through September.</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which takes aim at a $258M funding gap for major maintenance needs over the next ten years.&nbsp; Further, PP&amp;R anticipates $480M in unfunded <em>growth</em> needs during that period.&nbsp; That adds up to a $738M funding gap over the next decade, which Commissioner Fritz will continue to work with City Council to address. Currently, 19% of people living in Portland do NOT have access to a park or natural area within a 15-minute walk, and the bureau is working hard to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;.&nbsp; PP&amp;R data show that pools are one of the bureau&rsquo;s most widely utilized features, and we recognize their importance to the community.</p>

This 40% increase in ridership from the previous year have helped a 31% increase in mass transit ridership, an 18% decrease in vehicle trips, and a significant decrease -estimated at more than 600 tons - of greenhouse gas emissions from cars visiting Washington Park, since 2014.

<p>&ldquo;These are impressive numbers,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The shuttle means it is easier than ever to get around Washington Park, and that the park hosts thousands fewer cars than it used to.&nbsp; This is just one more way we&rsquo;re working to create a wonderful experience for visitors to Washington Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?propertyid=841&amp;action=viewpark"">Washington Park</a> is home to some of Portland&rsquo;s most popular attractions, including the Oregon Zoo, Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, World Forestry Center, Hoyt Arboretum, Portland Japanese Garden, and International Rose Test Garden. The popularity of the park continues to grow &ndash; with an overall attendance increase of 8% over the past three years, currently estimated at 3.2 million visitors annually.</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">The shuttle and park improvements are made possible by the modest $1.60 per hour parking fee at Washington Park, by promoting alternative travel options, and actively managing parking. &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Normal1"">All parking proceeds are reinvested in improvements in and around the park, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better maintenance and security</li>
<li>The free park-wide shuttle service</li>
<li>Improved safety for drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and disabled visitors (for example: better signs, barrier-free sidewalks, and crosswalks)</li>
<li>A new Washington Park Master Plan, established via community engagement</li>
</ul>
<p class=""Normal1CxSpFirst"">&ldquo;Washington Park is a crown jewel in our system,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And Explore Washington Park is an innovative collaboration which helps steward these much-needed improvements. Because of this new system, we were able to begin the new Washington Park Master Planning process, which will improve and guide the park and its vision for the coming decades.&nbsp; Thanks to all who are a part of this important and admirable work.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""Normal1CxSpLast"">Improvements to date, all made possible by paid parking revenue, include new paving on cracked and potholed park roads, new traffic and directional signs, a new crosswalk with flashing lights at a critical crossing by the Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, repainted parking space numbers, the shuttle, the Explore Washington Park website, and Customer Service staff to provide information to park visitors in peak season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Explore Washington Park Board is proud of its accomplishments over the past several years and is pleased to be working with the community, making investments designed to improve the experience of visitors.&rdquo; &nbsp;- Eric Vines, World Forestry Center, Executive Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Photo: The iconic but deteriorated columns at Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square will be restored during the largest Parks Replacement Bond project, which begins on January 30, 2017.</em></p>
<p>""When more than 70% of Portland voters approved the Parks Replacement Bond in 2014, they voted to repair and renew Pioneer Courthouse Square,&rdquo; says PCS Board President Dan Lavey. &ldquo;We will fix a leaking roof, modernize old restrooms and refresh the signature bricks. After completion, the Square will re-open to the 11 million people who visit and use it each year. In the meantime, we encourage people to become a piece of history and <a href=""https://thesquarepdx.org/shop/bricks/"">purchase a brick</a>.""</p>
<p>As part of the Parks Replacement Bond project, all of the Square&rsquo;s bricks with names on them that are impacted by construction will be replaced with original inscriptions in a similar location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The material under the bricks which keeps water from leaking below ground was originally rated to last only twenty years,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp;&ldquo;It is now in a state of failure after thirty years. I am excited that we are preserving the original design and feel of this world-famous public space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pioneer Courthouse Square has been affectionately known as Portland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Living Room&rdquo; since its opening in 1984. The Square, a 40,006 square foot urban park located at the heart of the downtown core, has been a public gathering space for the benefit of Portland&rsquo;s community members and visitors. Pioneer Courthouse Square is one of the most visited public sites in Oregon. The Square hosts more than 300 programmed events each year that reflect the civic role of the Square within the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard S. Wright and Faison Construction are honored to partner with the City of Portland, Shiels Obletz Johnsen, and SRG Partnership to deliver the goals of the Pioneer Courthouse Square renovation project,&rdquo; says Troy Dickson, Senior Vice President &amp; Oregon Manager with Howard S. Wright.&nbsp;&ldquo;As one of Oregon&rsquo;s most visited public sites, our team&rsquo;s priority is to maintain safe access and deliver construction activities with the least possible disruption to surrounding businesses and guests of the Square.&nbsp;We are excited to be a part of a project that is so important to our community.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>All businesses located within the Square will be open during construction. This includes Big Red Arrow and Portland Walking Tours, Honkin&rsquo; Huge Burritos, Philly&rsquo;s on the Phly, Spellbound Flowers, Starbucks, Travel Portland, and TriMet.</li>
<li>The Square will continue to hold events in the area not impacted by the construction.</li>
<li>Access routes to Square businesses and services may be altered to provide safe access. Informational signage will be installed throughout the construction project to aid in site navigation.</li>
<li>Public restrooms in the Square will be closed, and signage will direct the public to alternate nearby public restrooms.</li>

<p><strong>About the Parks Replacement Bond</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to overwhelming voter support of the <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, PP&amp;R is repairing some of the most critical components of the City&rsquo;s park system<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Parks Replacement Bond was passed with the support of over 70% of voters in November 2014.&nbsp;Its primary focus is on repair and replacement of the most critical needs in the parks system. Thirty Bond-funded projects are underway; five are complete. Eighteen projects are expected to break ground over the next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which takes aim at a $248M funding gap for major maintenance needs over the next ten years. Further, PP&amp;R anticipates $472M in unfunded <em>growth</em> needs during that period. That adds up to a $720M funding gap over the next decade, which Commissioner Fritz will continue to work with City Council to address. Currently, 20% of people living in Portland do NOT have access to a park or natural area within a 15-minute walk, and the bureau is working hard to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>WHAT: New Year in the Park &ndash; A Celebration of Southeast Asian Culture and Heritage. This event is free to attend and everyone is invited!<br /></strong><strong>WHEN: Saturday, April 28, 2018, 9:30am-6:00pm<br /></strong><strong>WHERE: Glenhaven Park, NE 82<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and Siskiyou Street&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong>WEBSITE:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.newyearinthepark.com/"">newyearinthepark.com</a></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Integrating refugees and immigrants into our community makes Portland increasingly richer and culturally diverse,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;New Year in the Park is an opportunity both to celebrate the cultures of Southeast Asia, and to reaffirm that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is inclusive - and a safe place for everyone. That goes for all neighbors, whether they&rsquo;ve been in Portland for a week - or for their entire lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Year is the most important festival which celebrates the vibrant and rich Southeast Asian cultures. Cambodian, Laotian, Thai and Burmese cultures all celebrate New Year each April, but historically, Portland&rsquo;s communities always held separate celebrations.&nbsp; Now, for the fourth straight year, the different but equally fascinating languages and cultures are coming together to foster greater understanding and appreciation of these proud communities. Thousands of people attended 2017&rsquo;s New Year in the Park.</p>
<p>""The success of New Year in the Park is a dream come true, just as I had hoped,&rdquo; beams Saron Khut, one of the creators of the annual event. &ldquo;I love seeing the community coming together to celebrate this joyous festival, and the continued strong support from the neighborhood, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and the City.&nbsp;I am so proud of our Southeast Asian communities for doing an incredible job at organizing and raising more than $20,000 to make this event happen.&nbsp;They are awesome!&nbsp;Sursdey Chnum Tmey; or in English, Happy New Year!""&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The multicultural New Year celebration is another important step towards the inclusion of all Portlanders in enjoying our parks and natural areas,&rdquo;&nbsp;says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We want <em>all </em>Portlanders, regardless of culture, background, ethnicity or gender to know that the parks belong to you.&nbsp;We will continue to work hard to remove or reduce barriers to access and participation for everyone, including communities of color, people with disabilities, or recent immigrants.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>New Year in the Park - f</strong><strong>ounded by a refugee</strong></p>
<p>Saron Khut, the creator of Portland&rsquo;s New Year in the Park celebration, lived through the brutal reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The group&rsquo;s leaders slaughtered more than 1 million victims. Khut has been a Portlander and a business owner for more than 35 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so happy to be in America, even though I knew nothing about the country, the language, the culture,&rdquo; Khut recalls of coming to the Rose City.&nbsp;&ldquo;As I grew up in Portland I tried to assimilate as much as I could, but I still valued the culture of my homeland. I want my children to realize who and where they come from. That&rsquo;s why it is so special to partner with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, to tie my current home and city to my native land and culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is special to see the New Year in the Park celebration return for its third year,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And to be a part of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s efforts to help newcomers to Portland realize the opportunities available to them, as well as to realize their own potential. Immigrant communities need to feel safe, to learn that they are welcome in public spaces &ndash; this is not something that always comes naturally to people from other countries. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s efforts towards inclusion are vital, and the Bureau&rsquo;s support has been outstanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PP&amp;R is helping us realize the dream of having a celebration this diverse, this large, and this fun, for the third straight year.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><em>2018 Evans Scholarship winners Victoria Dang, Joseph Goodwin, Anthony Nguyen, and Taylor Phomphakdy, will all attend the University of Oregon beginning this fall, on full scholarships, thanks in part to PP&amp;R&rsquo;s EAGLE Caddie program.&nbsp;Photos courtesy of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Portland, Oregon.</em></p>
<p>Four Portland-area students who take part in the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation <a href=""/parks/61974"">EAGLE</a> Caddie program (Early Adventures in Golf for a Lifetime of Enjoyment) have earned full housing and tuition scholarships through the Evans Scholars Program: Parkrose High School senior Thu Victoria Dang, Parkose High senior Joseph Goodwin, Benson High senior Anthony Nguyen, and Parkrose High senior Taylor Phomphakdy. The quartet have been awarded full scholarships to the University of Oregon, beginning this fall.</p>
<p>Evans Scholarships are supported by the Western Golf Association, and valued at more than $100,000 over four years. The requirements for becoming an Evans Scholar are based on having financial need, good grades, a strong caddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offer my heartfelt congratulations to these students for showing tremendous drive and initiative,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I am happy they have earned the Evans Scholarship to continue their education, demonstrating the success of an important partnership between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Golf Program and public and private high schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the scholarship recipients is Parkrose High School standout Taylor Phomphakdy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I literally cried tears of joy,&rdquo; says Phomphakdy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;ve been wanting more than to be the first in my family to attend a four-year university. But to get a full ride feels absolutely unreal. It still feels like a dream to me. I may be getting a full ride to UO, but I am forever indebted to the EAGLE Program because of the lifetime of opportunities it&rsquo;s now opened me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EAGLE program is a unique internship program that is a cooperative venture between <a href=""/parks/35300"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a> (PP&amp;R), Western Golf Association, and public and private high schools located within the city of Portland, aimed at introducing students to all aspects of golf course operation. Qualified students are paid an hourly wage, receive work credit hours, and have a mentor who monitors their progress. In addition, scholarship opportunities are available from their involvement in our program. Since 1992, over 80 students have successfully completed college on <a title=""Evans Scholarships Information"" href=""/parks/article/442649"">Evans Scholarships</a>&nbsp;received through PP&amp;R&rsquo;s EAGLE program. In addition to the scholarships, the Western Golf Association&rsquo;s Evans Scholars Foundation funds the EAGLE Caddie Program. As a part of the EAGLE program, Dang, Goodwin, Nguyen, and Phomphakdy served as caddies for 80 separate 18-hole rounds during the 2016 and 2017 summer golf seasons.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see many more exciting milestones in Thu, Anthony, Joseph, and Taylor&rsquo;s futures,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud that they have worked so hard in school, and in the EAGLE Caddie program, to be able to continue their superb academic achievement, and on full scholarships.&nbsp;The EAGLE program is one more way we provide our mission of &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>About the 2018 Scholarship Winners</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thu Victoria Dang </strong>is a Vietnamese immigrant who has lived in Portland since 2011. She attends Parkrose High School and lives with her mother and father. As she began middle school, Victoria only spoke a handful of English words. However, she was able to successfully exit the school&rsquo;s English as a Second Language program by the end of 8<sup>th</sup> grade. Now she&rsquo;s a freshman-to-be at the University of Oregon, on a full-ride scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Goodwin</strong>&nbsp;is a top student at Parkrose High School who believes his best attributes are his perseverance, and ability to adapt to his surroundings. Joseph is excited to begin college, and plans to attend medical school to become an anesthesiologist.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Nguyen</strong> attends Portland&rsquo;s Benson High School and says that education is his top priority. Anthony notes that higher education is not affordable to everyone.

<p><strong>About the Evans Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Famed golfer Charles ""Chick"" Evans, Jr. grew up in the Chicago area in the early 1900s. Evans earned money by caddying at the local country club. Wanting to go to college, he found that he could not afford it, nor was there anyone to help him. In 1916, Evans won both the US Amateur and the US Open golf tournaments, and with the victories came considerable wealth and fame. Determined to help others in his former situation, he started the Evans Scholars Foundation. It is currently one of the country&rsquo;s largest, privately funded scholarship programs.</p>
<p>Supported by the Western Golf Association, the Chick Evans Caddie Scholarship&nbsp;provides full housing and tuition to deserving caddies across the country. Currently,&nbsp;965 caddies are attending college on scholarship; there are more than 10,600 Evans alumni worldwide. Most Evans Scholars attend one of the 14 universities where the Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.</p>
<p>The Evans Scholars Program is funded by contributions from more than 32,000 supporters nationwide, as well as Evans Scholars Alumni and proceeds from the BMW Championship. Portland Public Golf Manager John Zoller is a proud to be an Evans Scholar alumnus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirements for an Evans Scholar are based on financial need, good citizenship, and being a top student and caddie.</p>

</ul>
<p class=""Default"">Today, the Portland City Council unanimously approved an <a href=""http://issuu.com/portlandparks/docs/wamp_update_final?e=3709716/57977656"">updated master plan</a> that will strategically guide the future development of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Washington Park over the next decades. The plan addresses transportation and parking issues, maintenance and access, identifies opportunities for a new park entrance on West Burnside, and for plazas and gardens. The updated Washington Park Master Plan is the result of extensive public engagement which has resulted in a new and exciting vision for the iconic park. The plan aims to make Washington Park more bike and pedestrian-friendly, and preserves and improves the park&rsquo;s ecological health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new master plan will guide Washington Park towards an enhanced visitor experience for everyone, with less dependence on cars,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The park&rsquo;s natural areas will be improved and preserved, maintenance will be a key initiative, and Washington Park will become more transit-friendly and pedestrian-friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master plan also aims to protect, preserve and enhance the park&rsquo;s natural areas, plants, animals and birds, recognizing the Washington Park is part of an important regional wildlife corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With three million visitors each year, Washington Park is Portland&rsquo;s most recognizable and iconic park,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The new master plan will ensure its world class status for Portlanders and visitors alike. That begins with an improved visitor experience. Thanks to all of our partners, volunteers, Champions Committee, and all Portlanders, for their commitment to helping us shape Washington Park&rsquo;s vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img title=""A paricipant in a November 2017 Washington Park community engagement session"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=676824"" alt=""A paricipant in a November 2017 Washington Park community engagement session"" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>An important first step in the implementation of this new plan will be the Transportation Management Study. This work will mirror the extensive public engagement undertaken for the master plan, and will focus on understanding transportation and parking opportunities and challenges in the park.&nbsp; Throughout this process, <a href=""https://trimet.org/"">TriMet</a> will continue to provide regular bus service to Washington Park, and <a href=""http://explorewashingtonpark.org/"">Explore Washington Park</a> continues to provide a free visitor shuttle within the park - with service from April-October. The number of people taking mass transit to Washington Park is up 66% since the free shuttle and paid parking endeavors began in 2014 - even as the park&rsquo;s overall attendance has increased.&nbsp;Ridership on the free shuttle has increased 40% since service began, and has resulted in a significant decrease -estimated at more than 600 tons - of greenhouse gas emissions from cars visiting Washington Park, since 2014. Shuttle riders helped save enough driving miles to total five trips from the earth to the moon.</p>
<p class=""Default"">Master plan elements include:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Managing and enhancing current park assets</li>
<li>Improving access to and around the park</li>
<li>Protecting and preserving Washington Park&rsquo;s natural areas and wildlife</li>
<li>Improved safety for park visitors</li>
<li>A new entrance off W. Burnside for people on foot and bike</li>
<li>Maintaining the same amount of parking spaces while reducing congestion</li>
<li>A garden plaza between the Portland Japanese Garden and International Rose Test Garden</li>
<li>A garden plaza when you get off the MAX so you enter a park, not a parking lot.</li>
<li>Offering clear park and wayfinding information at multiple park sites</li>
<li>Enhancing the visitor experience for pedestrians and people on bikes, while ensuring the park is less car-dependent through a variety of improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>The process for developing the new master plan was based on a robust engagement strategy that took place over a period of 18 months and included: regular and ongoing consultation with key stakeholders including the Explore Washington Park Board and adjacent neighborhood associations and neighbors; public events; surveying park users; an online survey; culturally-specific focus groups conducted in Vietnamese and Russian. The engagement was supported by the Champions Committee &ndash; a 16-member committee appointed by Parks Commissioner Fritz to oversee and advise on the plan&rsquo;s development &ndash; creating goals and a vision for the project to address the key issues and opportunities that the park will face over the next decades.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will be working with the Commissioner-in-Charge of Parks, Metro, and the community, to seek funding for implementing the projects outlined in the master plan update.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/676822

<p>(Portland, OR) -</p>
<p><em><strong>Bureau earns significant rebates, reinvested in yet more energy efficient projects; PP&amp;R efforts mean&nbsp;less need for maintenance, and lower costs</strong></em></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) earned more than $250,000 in rebates in 2017 for the Bureau&rsquo;s efforts towards energy efficiency and sustainability. The savings to taxpayers are thanks to PP&amp;R staff efforts and a partnership with the <a href=""https://www.energytrust.org/"">Energy Trust of Oregon</a>.</p>
<p>The Bureau will be reinvesting those rebates to launch an energy- and water-saving project at 48 sites; an effort towards sustainability on a much larger scale.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=673265"" alt="""" width=""393"" height=""294.75"" /></p>
<p><em>PHOTO: Solar panels help power PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Matt Dishman Community Center. The Bureau&rsquo;s East Portland Community Center, Wilson Pool, and Southwest Community Center also have solar panels.</em></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is making a significant contribution towards the City&rsquo;s commitment to using 100% renewable energy by 2050. This mark was established by a unanimous City Council vote in 2017, and Portland&rsquo;s elected officials continue to recognize the importance energy efficiency plays in reaching that achievement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is leading the way towards sustainability and energy efficiency,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Our City must move towards sustainable practices as soon as possible. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s programs, sites, and staff are becoming a model of how city government can embrace sustainability, while reducing costs to taxpayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation earned $267,191 in rebates from Energy Trust of Oregon in 2017, and thanks to ongoing energy-saving efforts, the Bureau has another $120,841 in further credits earned for next year already. The credits were largely awarded for upgrades to various building control systems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These savings, and the upcoming large-scale sustainability project, would not have happened without the innovative efforts of our dedicated PP&amp;R staff,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;PP&amp;R project managers and maintenance workers - electricians, carpenters, and other tradespeople -earned those rebates. I applaud our creative, committed staff and their ongoing work to ensure a greener future for Portlanders, of both current and future generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bureau will be establishing a pilot program - an energy and water savings performance contract - to study how utility use can be reduced. The target of the pilot is to reduce maintenance and utility costs at approximately 20% of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s sites. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is proud to take this important step in realizing the City&rsquo;s sustainability goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About the Evans Scholarship</strong></p>
<p>Famed golfer Charles ""Chick"" Evans, Jr. grew up in the Chicago area in the early 1900s. Evans earned money by caddying at the local country club. Wanting to go to college, he found that he could not afford it, nor was there anyone to help him. In 1916, Evans won both the US Amateur and the US Open golf tournaments, and with the victories came considerable wealth and fame. Determined to help others in his former situation, he started the Evans Scholars Foundation. It is currently one of the country&rsquo;s largest, privately funded scholarship programs.</p>
<p>Supported by the Western Golf Association, the Chick Evans Caddie Scholarship&nbsp;provides full housing and tuition to deserving caddies across the country. Currently,&nbsp;965 caddies are attending college on scholarship; there are more than 10,600 Evans Alumni worldwide. Most Evans Scholars attend one of the 14 universities where the Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.</p>
<p>The Evans Scholars Program is funded by contributions from more than 32,000 supporters nationwide, as well as Evans Scholars Alumni and proceeds from the BMW Championship. Portland Public Golf manager John Zoller is a proud Evans Scholar Alum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirements for an Evans Scholar are based on financial need, good citizenship, and being a top student and caddie.</p>

<p><em><strong>Completed improvements enhance nature park access; more enhancements coming.</strong></em></p>
<p>The new entry improvements at Whitaker Ponds Nature Park are complete, with a formal Portland Parks &amp; Recreation celebration and dedication this spring.</p>
<p>The nearly 25-acre Whitaker Ponds Nature Park,&nbsp;located at 7040 NE 47th Avenue, contains ponds and natural areas. Popular uses of the nature park include education, birdwatching, light watercraft access to Whitaker Slough, and other nature-based recreation. <a href=""/parks/article/659341"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a> (PP&amp;R), the City of Portland <a href=""/bes/"">Bureau of Environmental Services</a> (BES) and the <a href=""https://www.columbiaslough.org/"">Columbia Slough Watershed Council</a> (CSWC) actively invite school groups, volunteers, and other partners to the park for educational and volunteer programs. However, before this project was completed, access to the site was difficult without any developed parking or sidewalks.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=669184"" alt="""" width=""240"" height=""295.081967213"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Creating improved access to nature, and for all Portlanders, is a key mission of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I thank PP&amp;R staff, City, and Metro partners for making it easier than ever before to get to and enjoy this intriguing nature park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2012, the CSWC partnered with BES and produced a concept design for significant and long-awaited improvements to the entry area off NE 47th Avenue. PP&amp;R, partnering with the two groups, applied for and received a Metro <a href=""https://www.oregonmetro.gov/tools-partners/grants-and-resources/nature-grants"">Nature in Neighborhoods grant</a> to help fund the project, which implements the 2012 concept in an environmentally responsible manner. The Metro Nature in Neighborhoods grant funding is supplemented by some Parks System Development Charges (<a href=""/parks/38516"">SDCs</a>).</p>
<p>The improvements to Whitaker Ponds Nature Park include a new parking lot with better access for school buses, bike racks, stormwater treatment facilities, accessible routes to the educational facilities, and a small natural gathering area. Coming soon are new sidewalks, bike lanes, a sanitary sewer extension north of Whitaker Slough, a stormwater sewer extension, and a full reconstruct of the street, thanks to our partners at PBOT, BES and <a href=""/water/"">the Portland Water Bureau</a>. The Water Bureau plans to replace the 100-year old cast iron water main.</p>
<p>Whitaker Ponds is a shining example of a working, thriving natural environment in the midst of the bustling metropolitan Portland area,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We are very excited that the nature park is now even more of a destination for area schoolchildren, hikers, and wildlife enthusiasts. Whitaker Ponds Nature Park is surrounded by industrial buildings and businesses. So this project is further proof that nature can thrive anywhere in our city, when given a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation extends thanks to local students, community members, and project partners for their contributions &ndash; extending a 20 year history of stewardship - in cleaning up and advocating for the site. Their work has greatly helped transform the site, a former junkyard, into a beautiful natural area. Notably, volunteers helped prepare the area for the recently installed improvements.</p>
<p>This project has increased the capacity of Whitaker Ponds Nature park to serve the public by improving visitor safety, accessibility, and aesthetics, and creating a more inviting public entry space. The Bureau is pleased to offer expanded educational, recreational, and stewardship activities within Whitaker Ponds Nature Park. PP&amp;R looks forward to keeping neighbors and other stakeholders updated on the Spring 2018 celebration as plans come together.</p>

The opening is exciting!&rdquo; says Portland Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Thanks to the dedicated neighbors, the park&rsquo;s project advisory committee, and all PP&amp;R staff and partners, an amazing gathering space for the community to connect with nature and others has been created. This park will surely be the site of many wonderful memories, for generations of Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spring Garden Park was at first an undeveloped hillside covering 4.65 acres. But after extensive community input, planning, and work by PP&amp;R staff and contractors, the park is now a gleaming, neighborhood destination which includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A children&rsquo;s playground with an interactive water feature, embankment slide, contemporary play structures, musical chimes, rock scramble, and tree logs and stumps for nature-based play. The playground meets all current ADA requirements</li>
<li>The playground&rsquo;s signature customized observation tower, with space to play and telescopes</li>
<li>Accessible walking path connection between SW Dolph Court and Spring Garden Street</li>
<li>Improved hillside storm drainage with native wildflowers and grasses.</li>
<li>New sidewalks, street trees, storm water improvements and parallel parking along SW Dolph Court and Spring Garden Street</li>
<li>A Portland Loo restroom facility along with bike racks, drinking fountain and trash receptacles</li>
<li>Benches, a sitting area, picnic tables, and a picnic shelter</li>
<li>Flower gardens</li>
<li>A public art installation, &ldquo;The Nest&rdquo;, by Hannes Wingate</li>
<li>A gathering area (suitable for events like Movies in the Park, part of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Summer Free For All), with a buffer zone between the park and adjacent neighbors&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The Friends of Spring Garden Park had a key role in cultivating community support for the park, and enthusiastically engaged neighbors in the planning and design process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation planners worked hard to incorporate neighbors&rsquo; ideas to ensure that the new park is accessible and continues to support local activities, such as star-gazing on clear evenings, and sledding during snow,&rdquo; says Lori Howell of Friends of Spring Garden Park. &ldquo;We are thrilled for the grand opening to connect with neighbors and friends who have worked for years to make this day a reality.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The transformation of Spring Garden Park to a jewel of a neighborhood park from the empty hillside it was for so long is simply remarkable,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;The play area and other park features are so appealing and innovative. It is an impressive park, and the result of a true community effort in the site&rsquo;s planning and design. We hope neighbors enjoy it immensely.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The park will serve 1,359 nearby households. 128 of those households were not previously within half a mile of a park, which is Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s goal for service citywide. Spring Garden Park is located in a park-deficient area of southwest Portland. The Spring Garden Park project is funded by $3.85M of <a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks System Development Charges</a> (revenue from citywide construction development) which serve to increase needed infrastructure. SDCs are not General Fund tax dollars.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that the section of southwest Portland&rsquo;s Willamette Greenway Trail which received paving and construction improvements is now REOPENED for use, effective immediately. Contractors repaved a portion of the trail in the area of Cottonwood Bay (extending north and south of SW Hamilton Court) to address bumps and an uneven surface caused by tree root impacts.</p>
<p>The improvement work and trail closure began Tuesday, June 5, 2018, and PP&amp;R and contractors were able to complete the entire effort in just three days. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation thanks all park visitors, including commuters, cyclists, walkers, runners, and all area neighbors for their patience and enthusiasm as the much-anticipated project was completed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R prioritized the Willamette Greenway Trail paving project to increase the convenience for commuters and recreational users during the <a href=""/bes/76508"">upcoming four-month closure of part of the Springwater Corridor Trail</a>, which begins July 1, 2018. Portland&rsquo;s Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and the US Army Corps of Engineers will work together on the&nbsp; large-scale habitat enhancement project that benefits wildlife in the Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge.

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong><em>Kids play for free on Mondays this summer at two Portland Parks Golf facilities starting June 25, 2018</em></strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/63560"">Portland Parks Golf</a> now offers Free Golf Mondays for junior golfers (kids up to the age of 17) at both the <a href=""/parks/65570"">Colwood Golf Center</a> and <a href=""/parks/63563"">Eastmoreland Golf Course</a>. Starting Monday, June 25, 2018, junior golfers can play for free from sunrise until 3pm on Mondays this summer until school begins again. This program includes the use of golf clubs for kids during their rounds! Please note that kids ages nine and under must be accompanied by an adult when they play.</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=688746"" alt="""" width=""50%"" />&nbsp;The revitalized Colwood Golf Center is located in northeast Portland&rsquo;s Cully neighborhood and managed by KemperSports. In recent years the property has received notable improvements and been transformed into a haven for both junior and beginner golfers, featuring a 9-hole, par 3 course layout and premier driving range. Colwood Golf Center will also host our free public celebration: &ldquo;<a href=""/parks/76732"">The Next 100</a> &ndash; Celebrating the Future of Portland Parks Golf&rdquo; on Sunday, August 26, 2018. Please join in the free, family fun!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The historic Eastmoreland Golf Course features an 18-hole course layout, and is entering its second century as part of Portland Parks Golf. The course offers a wide variety of junior golf lessons, as well FREE use of the driving range for kids up to the age of 17, every morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want junior golfers who are both experienced and brand-new to the game to enjoy Portland Parks Golf facilities even more this summer,&rdquo; says John Zoller, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director of Golf. &ldquo;Golf is a fun, lifelong game and we are delighted to welcome the next generation of golfers for free, all summer long. We hope it is the start of a lifetime of love for the game in general, and with Portland Parks Golf in particular.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No reservations are needed nor taken for Free Golf Mondays. Tee times are offered on a walk-up basis every Monday from opening until 3pm based on availability. A reminder that players aged nine and under must be accompanied by an adult on the golf course. The City will evaluate the program&rsquo;s success, and possibly consider offering free Monday golf for kids up to 17 years of age on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A notable tradition in golf&rsquo;s rich history was that caddies could play the courses at which they worked - on Mondays.&nbsp;Many of today&rsquo;s avid golfers learned the game and became lifelong enthusiasts after taking advantage of such opportunities.&nbsp;Today, however, very few clubs still offer such occasions, and most are limited to private golf clubs.&nbsp;Portland Parks Golf has noted fewer kids playing golf in recent years, and aims to help reverse that trend, in part by adopting this tradition via Free Golf Mondays for young people. Portland Parks Golf aims to engage and encourage the next generation of golfers and to foster greater diversity in, and access to, the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, golf and kids are good for one another!&rdquo; smiles Zoller, who has worked for Portland Parks Golf for nearly 40 years.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Note: the parking lot at NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Avenue will be reserved primarily for guests with mobility concerns and elderly visitors and is expected to be full.

<p>&ldquo;The new park is a beautiful place that is a tribute to the years of effort by Verde, the Let Us Build Cully Park! Coalition, the community, Commissioner Nick Fish and me, and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The park construction would not have been accomplished without these partners&rsquo; efforts, and the completion of the first community-driven parks project in an underserved, diverse area of town is a testimony to collaboration by many individual and agencies. I am immensely happy to be the Commissioner-in-Charge at the opening and offer my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So many, many individuals, groups and institutions played indispensable roles in making the dream of Cully Park into a reality, including our incredible friends at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and we are grateful for this good work we have done together,&rdquo; says Alan Hip&oacute;lito, Executive Director of Verde. &ldquo;Cully Park is a statement about the power of community, and I want to especially thank the hundreds of Cully adults, families and children who worked so hard for so long -- my friends, you did it, you designed and built a park which everyone can enjoy, and which will serve generations of Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Cully Park success story</strong></p>
<p>The community, let by the non-profit Verde, spearheaded the park&rsquo;s development through the Let Us Build Cully Park! coalition; and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation supplemented funding to make the park a reality after years of fundraising, planning, and anticipation. The project has transformed a former landfill (and before that, a sand and gravel mine) into a developed, 25-acre city park in Portland&rsquo;s Cully neighborhood, one of the most diverse in the entire state of Oregon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cully Park means that 517 Portland families who did not previously have access to <em>any</em> park or natural area - defined as a half-mile walk -&nbsp; now have one of the largest City parks in Portland to enjoy,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;From the unique Native Gathering Garden which will help honor and educate about indigenous cultural values and ethics, to sports fields, the huge play areas, climbing boulders, an overlook, dog off-leash area and much more, the park opening caps a much-anticipated, years-long process. Cully Park is now a showcase destination for relaxation, reflection, and play.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All park features have been designed and built through a deep commitment to community engagement and economic opportunity. Cully Park includes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Native Gathering Garden -- this unique feature will offer opportunities for honoring and educating about indigenous cultural values and ethics through holistic, culturally-significant garden design and maintenance. The site is intended as a catalyst for strengthening and healing relationships (between people, nature, and place) throughout our city. This work is centered on honoring, respecting, and educating through Indigenous cultural values.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A playground combining traditional play, nature play and inclusive elements.</li>
<li>The playground includes sand and a water play area</li>
<li>A dog off-leash area (nearly half an acre in size)</li>
<li>Restrooms</li>
<li>Walking paths</li>
<li>An overlook, picnic areas, and habitat restoration</li>
<li>A parking lot with 50 spaces</li>
<li>A Portland Community Garden (completed previously)</li>
<li>A youth soccer field</li>
<li>A Portland Community Garden (established and used since 2012)</li>
<li>Covered shelters</li>
<li>Space for two future baseball fields, full-size soccer field, and other park features when funding for the next phase of the park is determined&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;No single organization, community or jurisdiction could have built this park alone, but together we transformed what was essentially a mountain of trash into a new asset for Cully, and for Portland,&rdquo; adds Verde&rsquo;s Hip&oacute;lito.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to get there</strong></p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s main entrance, with a 50-space parking lot, is off NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Avenue, north of Killingsworth Street. Verde has redeveloped this entry point, transforming it into the &ldquo;NE 72nd Greenstreet&rdquo; - combining needed transportation improvements with innovative environmental elements. Note: for the grand opening, the parking lot at NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Avenue will be reserved primarily for guests with mobility concerns and elderly visitors and is expected to be full. The nearby Sheraton Hotel will provide shuttle buses from the Living Cully Plaza at 6723 NE Killingsworth Street to the park entrance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equity</strong></p>
<p>Cully Park&rsquo;s completion means that 517 Portland families who did not previously have any park or natural area within a half-mile now do, and it is an impressive destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cully Park furthers PP&amp;R&rsquo;s and the City&rsquo;s equity goals. Data show that central-northeast Portland is second only to the area east of I-205 in terms of the greatest need for parks and natural areas in the city. The Cully Park project is innovative because it was led by the community, and set ambitious workforce and contractor diversity goals. The City of Portland is proud to have been a partner in realizing the dream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cully area is one of the most diverse and park-deficient neighborhoods in the state. This area, and parts of east Portland, do not yet enjoy the same access to parks and green spaces as the rest of the city. 53% of residents in Cully Park&rsquo;s service area are people of color (city average is 28%), and 27% are households below poverty status (city average is 15%).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Funding</strong></p>
<p>The funding for Cully Park&rsquo;s unique public/private partnership comes from <a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks System Development Charges</a> and private donations. Verde, which spearheads the Let Us Build Cully Park! Coalition (a non-profit coalition of more than 15 community-based organizations), raised an eye-popping $7 million<strong> </strong>in donations from more than 50 partners and sources, including grants. Verde and the coalition worked tirelessly for years to cultivate financial support for the park. Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz dedicated just over $6 million ($6.02M) in System Development Charge (SDC) revenue towards the park&rsquo;s construction. SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of increased infrastructure demands.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>A celebration of those new to Portland and to the United States</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/69257"">Parks for New Portlanders Program&nbsp;</a>is hosting the 9<sup>th</sup> annual Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament&nbsp;at Delta Park&nbsp;on Friday, June 29, 2018 and Saturday, June 30, 2018, from 9am to 5pm both days. This year&rsquo;s tournament features a record 30 teams of Portlanders who are refugees and immigrants. Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and other guests will give brief remarks at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" style=""font-size: 13.2px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=688812"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""250"" /></p>
<p><strong>What: 2018 Portland&nbsp;</strong><strong>World Cup Soccer Tournament<br /></strong><strong>When: Friday, June 29, and Saturday, </strong><strong>June 30, 2018, 9:30am-5pm. The tournament&rsquo;s opening ceremony (a must-see) will be held at 10am on Friday, June 29.<br /></strong><strong>Where: Delta Park, 10737 N Union Court, Portland, Oregon 97217</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The record number of teams taking part shows the success of this innovative program reaching traditionally underserved communities,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;It is wonderful to see the popular annual Portland World Soccer Tournament help to build community, to celebrate diversity and cultures from around the world, and to help smooth the transitions for refugees and immigrants into their new lives in the Rose City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirty teams, the most in the tournament&rsquo;s history, will take part in this year's tournament. The record number means that around 500 recent refugee and immigrant players will come together and play more than 60 games. Players hail from a wide variety of countries and vibrant cultures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The love of soccer crosses borders and languages,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;So the game helps people who are new to Portland engage with the city&rsquo;s&nbsp;culture and communities. For young soccer players, teams provide community and valuable social support, encouraging positive choices during the transition to a new life. The tournament itself is a celebration of turning challenges into opportunities, and of building unity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament celebrates community, civic and economic engagement, diversity, partnerships, and helps with the integration of recent immigrants and refugees. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s showcase soccer tournament for New Portlanders also connects families who are new to Oregon with public services and resources, and&nbsp;to the broader Northwest community to which they now belong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One in eight Portlanders was born in a country other than the United States,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament is a wonderful, multicultural celebration, a way for young people who are new to Portland to become engaged with and connected to City tools and resources. As the Men&rsquo;s World Cup is under way in Russia, it&rsquo;s particularly delightful we&rsquo;re growing the game for both men and women here in Portland to celebrate diversity in the universal language of soccer.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""Default""><strong>Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers Team Up to Revitalize Portland&rsquo;s Public Basketball Courts </strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><em>&ndash; Up to 100 courts at 30 Portland Parks &amp; Recreation parks will get a makeover and upgrades, as a result of a $1,050,000 donation from the two organizations</em><em> </em><em>&ndash;</em><em></em></p>
<p class=""Default""><em></em><strong>Portland, Ore. </strong><strong>&ndash;</strong><strong> June 21, 2018 </strong><strong>&ndash; </strong>Today,<strong> </strong>Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers announced they are partnering to refresh and upgrade the majority of the basketball courts across 30 Portland Parks &amp; Recreation parks. The Portland City Council today approved the partnership agreement with Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>Nike&rsquo;s contribution to the 2018 Portland Basketball Courts Revitalization Project is a one-time donation of $750,000 to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, to be administered by Verde, to be used for the revitalization of the courts, while the Portland Trail Blazers will donate $100,000 a year for the next three years (2018-2020). Nike and the Trail Blazers will also continue to support youth programming on the courts including Summer Free for All, the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation summer program that provides free lunches and summer activities for kids during the day and great family activities in the evening.</p>
<p>Up to 100 courts across Portland will be repaired and refreshed with new paint and a new design featuring the name of the park. The backboards will also be redesigned with the name of the park&rsquo;s quadrant. Repairs to the court surface and replacement of backboards and hoops will take place as needed.</p>
<p>An anticipated reveal of the renewed court and backboard design is planned for late summer 2018, with individual court completions taking place from fall 2018 through fall 2019. Nike and the Trail Blazers have selected Verde&mdash;an Oregon nonprofit organization that serves communities by building environmental wealth through social enterprise, outreach and advocacy&mdash;to receive and manage the grant funds. Their social enterprise program Verde Builds will serve as the general contractor for the project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parks are at the heart of communities across the city, and a place for Portlanders of all ages to gather and play together,&rdquo; said Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The partnership will support repairing some of the most needed basketball courts in the parks system. I appreciate this opportunity to improve the recreational opportunities throughout Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This project is a continuation of the 2002 Anniversary Project in which Nike donated more than $2 million to the Portland Parks Foundation, in celebration of its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, to resurface all the outdoor basketball courts in 75 days as Nike&rsquo;s way of thanking the Portland area for being its home since 1972. In addition to the park name, the courts will also feature the Trail Blazer pinwheel and Nike swoosh logos.</p>
<p>Said Mayor Ted Wheeler: &ldquo;The continuation of Nike&rsquo;s commitment and partnership with the Portland Trail Blazers will extend the legacy of providing quality courts and youth programming that are accessible to all kids in Portland. These courts are a tremendous public resource, and the City of Portland appreciates Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers for their efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nike&rsquo;s ongoing partnership with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation reflects our commitment to the City of Portland, and to inspiring sport and physical activity for kids as part of our belief that kids aren&rsquo;t made to sit still, they&rsquo;re made to play,&rdquo; said Karol Collymore, Senior Manager, Global Community Impact, Oregon at Nike. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to continue our support of Portland&rsquo;s courts with the Portland Trail Blazers, knowing how much they share our passion for kids, community, sport and creating equal playing fields for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partnering with Nike, Portland Parks and Recreation, and Verde to revitalize several of the city&rsquo;s outdoor basketball courts is an exciting opportunity,&rdquo; said Christa Stout, Vice President of Social Responsibility for the Trail Blazers. &ldquo;The partnership allows us all to continue to prioritize equitable access to basketball across the city, which will also include fun programs with our youth coaches and the community.&rdquo;</p>

First established as a pilot project in 2017, the beach will open daily during park hours (5am-midnight) for recreational swimming during the summer of 2018. Poet&rsquo;s Beach is a sandy shore with river access, and an in-water swimming area delineated with a swim line and floats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Willamette River is Portland&rsquo;s largest public open space and natural area&ndash;but it&rsquo;s often underappreciated and underutilized,&rdquo; says Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s Beach is a big leap towards directing our citizens and visitors to places on our river we want them to go. Thank you to all those who made our vision of an urban beach on the shore of the Willamette possible for the second year in a row.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are welcome to join the celebration and ceremony on Thursday, July 12, 2018 at 10:30 am to officially re-open Poet&rsquo;s Beach for the 2018 season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ceremony will also feature children representing Honoring Our Rivers, a program and anthology that publishes children&rsquo;s poems and art related to Pacific Northwest rivers and stewardship. A sampling of poems from the 15 years of the anthology are engraved into stones lining the walkway to Poet&rsquo;s Beach. Children will read <em>new</em> poems inspired by the Willamette River at the ceremony. The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde (CTGR) will provide a blessing of the river and discuss the importance of the native words that the Tribes contributed to the stones at Poet&rsquo;s Beach.</p>

<hr />
<p>POSTED AUGUST 10, 2018<strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact<br /></strong>Delia Hernandez,&nbsp;<a href=""tel:503-422-7179"">503-422-7179</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""mailto:PHD.Communications@state.or.us"">PHD.Communications@state.or.us</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Advisory reissued based on visible scum found in Multnomah County water body</em></strong></p>
<p>The Oregon Health Authority reissued a recreational use health advisory today for Ross Island Lagoon and urges caution in areas of the Willamette River downstream from the lagoon, including downtown north to&nbsp;<a href=""x-apple-data-detectors://14"">Cathedral Park</a>.</p>
<p>Ross Island Lagoon is located about a mile south of downtown Portland in Multnomah County. The area of concern includes the downtown reach of the Willamette River.</p>
<p>Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) staff collected samples for toxin analysis and results are expected next week. Because the bloom has changed and spread so much since last week, OHA is issuing this advisory as a precautionary measure until sample results are available next week.</p>
<p>OHA first issued a health advisory for the Ross Island Lagoon on Aug. 3 and lifted it Aug. 7 after tests showed toxin levels were below recreational advisory levels.</p>
<p>DEQ also carried out a visual assessment of the river and reported cyanobacteria starting at 100 meters south of Ross Island lagoon. Inside the lagoon, the bloom is thick with scums, blobs and streaking throughout. Dense cyanobacteria continued down the East channel into the mainstem of the Lower Willamette and was present at River Place marina, the swimming dock south of the Hawthorne Bridge and&nbsp;<a href=""x-apple-data-detectors://17"">Tom McCall waterfront park</a>. The bloom was visible throughout the Portland reach and on the surface at the Riverscape dock. The bloom intensified to the railroad bridge downstream of Portland Harbor. At&nbsp;<a href=""x-apple-data-detectors://18"">Cathedral Park</a>, the bloom was present but less intense.</p>
<p>If present, toxins are usually highest in areas where the bloom is visible, and people can avoid most of the health risks associated with blooms by avoiding those areas. However, it&rsquo;s possible cyanotoxins can still exist in clear water. Sometimes, cyanobacteria can move into another area, making water that once looked foamy, scummy or discolored now look clear. Dying blooms can also release toxins that may reach into the clear water around them.</p>
<p>People should avoid swimming and high-speed water activities, such as water skiing or power boating, in areas where blooms are identified. Although toxins are not absorbed through the skin, people who have skin sensitivities may experience a puffy red rash at the affected area.</p>
<p>Drinking water directly from affected areas of the river is especially dangerous. OHA public health officials advise recreational visitors that toxins cannot be removed by boiling, filtering or treating water with camping-style filters.</p>
<p>People who draw in-home water directly from the affected area are advised to use an alternate water source because private treatment systems are not proven effective for removing algae toxins. However, public drinking water systems can reduce algae toxins through proper filtration and disinfection. This portion of the Willamette River is not a source of drinking water for a public water system, but if people connected to public water systems have questions about treatment and testing, they should contact their water supplier.</p>
<p>OHA public health officials recommend that those who choose to eat fish from waters where cyanobacteria blooms are present remove all fat, skin and organs before cooking, as cyanotoxins are more likely to collect in these tissues. Fillets should also be rinsed with clean water. Public health officials also advise people to not eat freshwater clams or mussels from the Lower Willamette River and that Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations do not allow the harvest of these shellfish from freshwater sources. Crayfish muscle can be eaten, but internal organs and liquid fat should be discarded.</p>
<p>Exposure to toxins can produce a variety of symptoms including numbness, tingling and dizziness that can lead to difficulty breathing or heart problems and require immediate medical attention. Symptoms of skin irritation, weakness, diarrhea, nausea, cramps and fainting should also receive medical attention if they persist or worsen. Children and pets are at increased risk for exposure because of their size and level of activity. People who bring their pets to the Lower Willamette River for recreation activities should take special precautions to keep them from drinking from or swimming in the river.</p>
<p>With proper precautions to avoid activities during which water can be ingested or inhaled, people are encouraged to visit the Lower Willamette River and enjoy activities such as canoeing, fishing, hiking, biking, picnicking, and bird watching. Boating is safe as long as speeds do not create excessive water spray. Although inhalation risk is much lower than ingestion, it can present a risk.</p>

However, free lunches WILL be served citywide. For all #SFFA info, please visit portlandoregon.gov/parks/sffa.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is closely keeping an eye on air quality in the Portland metro area, and working with health authorities to ensure our participants - particularly our most vulnerable populations, children, the elderly, and those with identified respiratory issues - are in a safe and healthy environment.</p>
<p>We also note that all parents can and should make their decisions based upon their own evaluations of the area&rsquo;s air quality, benefits, and potential risks of taking part in outdoor activities. Our goal as a Bureau is to try to maintain service levels for the families which do find their needs can best be met by participation. We recognize that some participation levels may be low. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If air quality moves into the &ldquo;Very Unhealthy&rdquo; range, as determined by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Portland Parks &amp; Recreation may potentially cancel or postpone some activities. Changes will be posted on the <a href=""/parks/article/142862"">Inclement Weather page</a> and other portlandparks.org sites, on Facebook.com/PortlandParks, on Twitter @PDXParksandRec, and sent to local media outlets.

I thank all partners and PP&amp;R staff for their hard work and input towards making Gateway Discovery Park inclusive, fun, and innovative.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, the most exciting aspect of Gateway Discovery Park is the inclusive playground &ndash; thanks to Harper&rsquo;s Playground &ndash; which helps further our equity goals and allows kids of all abilities to play together,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;The park and plaza provide a welcome space for recreation, reflection, <a href=""/parks/61921"">Summer Free For All</a> activities, and special events year-round. It will be a vital part of our city, for generations to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Harper's Playground is honored to be included as part of this wonderfully realized community asset,&rdquo; says Harper&rsquo;s Playground Executive Director G Cody QJ Goldberg.&nbsp;&ldquo;Our vision of a Harper&rsquo;s Playground- certified inclusive playground in every quadrant of Portland is one big step closer to reality. We are thankful to&nbsp;Parks Commissioner Fritz, all PP&amp;R staff and partners, and everyone involved for embracing this park&rsquo;s vision. Together, we are ensuring that everyone is invited to play and connect at Gateway Discovery Park.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years to come, Gateway Discovery Park will provide a plaza space that will accommodate community celebrations similar to Pioneer Courthouse Square. On August 18, 2018, Gateway Discovery Park will be the site of Portland&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/article/683683"">Tonga Day Festival</a> beginning at 1pm. The day of cultural celebrations and family fun continues with live Pacific Islander/Tongan music at 6:30pm, and ends with the Summer Free For All Movie in the Park showing of Moana at dusk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday, August 19, 2018, the park will also be a Sunday Parkways destination and the <a href=""/parks/article/689282"">WALK with Refugees and Immigrants</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>A partnership project with Prosper Portland (formerly the Portland Development Commission)</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Park features<em><br /></em></strong>The 3.2-acre park serves as a &ldquo;living room&rdquo; for the Gateway and surrounding neighborhoods. The park has a designated activity space and is designed to appeal to people of all ages and abilities. The plaza will accommodate a variety of events, festivals, and farmer&rsquo;s markets. Other features include a large grassy lawn, a splash pad for water play, a skateboard area, elements for nature-based play, picnic areas, innovative public art, and places to relax.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Equity/equal access<em><br /></em></strong>Gateway Discovery Park serves more than 800 new households which formerly did not have ready access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk). Data show that 36% of these households are racial and ethnic minorities, and that 28% are experiencing poverty.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Funding<em><br /></em></strong>Gateway Discovery Park cost $10.2 million (rounded), which includes $8.8 million from&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a>&nbsp;(or SDCs - one-time fees assessed on new development to help keep pace with infrastructure needs; SDCs are not General Fund tax dollars), $1.2 million from Prosper Portland (formerly the Portland Development Commission), and $225,000 from <a href=""https://harpersplayground.org/"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Harper&rsquo;s Playground</strong><em><br /></em>Our valued non-profit partner, <a href=""http://www.harpersplayground.org/"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a>, committed to raising the needed funds to make the new Gateway Discovery Park the site of Portland&rsquo;s next inclusive play area (and the second completed in the City).

<p>&ldquo;Trees are part of Portland&rsquo;s history and heritage,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;They keep stormwater out of our local rivers, clean our air, and make our neighborhoods greener. I&rsquo;m proud that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is helping bring more trees to our City, especially in East Portland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Urban Forestry's Yard Tree Giveaway provides free trees for neighbors to plant on private property. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Urban Forestry gave away 567 trees to Portlanders last year, and 63% of the trees went to people who identified as belonging to low-income households. Trees offer many benefits including cleaning the air, cooling the city during the summer months, and providing homes for birds, bees, and other wildlife. The species offered at the events will focus on large form, native, and evergreen species. Some medium size trees will also be available for smaller yards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trees are expected to go quickly, so neighbors are encouraged to <a href=""/parks/article/696074"">register and reserve a tree today</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GUIDELINES FOR RECEIVING A TREE:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trees are for planting on private property in front, side or back yards (trees&nbsp;may not be planted in containers or in the sidewalk as street trees)</li>
<li>Trees must be planted within the City of Portland</li>
<li>Limit of two trees per household</li>
<li>Trees are not to be used for planting permit requirements&nbsp;</li>

<p>POSTED OCTOBER 9, 2018</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rose City native takes helm of popular, citywide program</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.portlandparks.org/"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a> (PP&amp;R) announces that Vincent Johnson is the new Director of <a href=""/parks/63560"">Portland Parks Golf</a>. Johnson, a Portland native and former professional player, takes the helm from longtime Golf Director John Zoller who led the program from 1987 until his recent retirement. Johnson joined PP&amp;R in 2016 as Assistant Director of Golf. During his time at PP&amp;R, Vincent has championed growing the game of golf through outreach to women, youth, and people of color.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks Golf just celebrated its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;We are fortunate to have a professional like Vincent Johnson lead our recreational golf program and provide the vision for the <em>next</em> 100 years.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent is the ideal person to continue a proud tradition of leadership in providing all the benefits that Portland Parks Golf has to offer,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;He excels at promoting positive engagement for youth and under-represented communities. With Vincent&rsquo;s leadership we will continue to ensure that the benefits of golf are available to all.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vincent, one of the most accomplished players from Portland, began playing golf at age six. He attended David Douglas High School and then earned his finance degree (with a minor in music) in just three years while on a golf scholarship at Oregon State University. Johnson has competed in tournaments on the PGA Tour and on the Web.com tour, winning the 2010 Long Beach Open, one of the biggest mini tour events on the West Coast, while competing as a professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Serving as the new Director of Portland Parks Golf is humbling,&rdquo; says Johnson. ""My thanks to everyone at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, to Parks Commissioner Nick Fish, and to all Portlanders whom we serve. I'm thrilled to be able to help inspire and encourage the next generation of golfers. Portland Parks Golf will keep working to better serve all current players, and people who are just discovering the game. That includes communities of color, women, and anyone who might not have previously thought the lifelong game of golf was for them.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the summer of 2018, Johnson led Portland Parks Golf&rsquo;s centennial celebration, including a commemoration of the first Portland Parks Golf Course at Eastmoreland and <a href=""/parks/article/695082"">The Next 100</a> event at Colwood Golf Center. Johnson has shared golf with new and old audiences alike at events like <a href=""https://youtu.be/2rpJRJcpwR4"">Race Talks</a> and <a href=""http://holynamesheritagecenter.org/history-pub/124-the-long-game-100-years-of-portland-parks-golf"">History Pub</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We succeed thanks to our hardworking maintenance staff and committed golf course operators,&rdquo; adds Johnson, &ldquo;They are why our team will continue to provide high quality golf and meaningful recreation opportunities to all Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""Default""><strong>Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers Come Together with Local Youth at Parklane Park to Celebrate the Tip-off of Citywide Basketball Courts Revitalization Project</strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><em>Courts in up to 30 Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites are getting a makeover and upgrades, as a result of a more than $1 million donation from the two organizations.</em><em><br /></em></p>
<p><strong>Portland, Oregon&nbsp;</strong><strong>&ndash;</strong><strong> October 11, 2018 </strong><strong>&ndash; </strong>Today, kids in outer southeast Portland gathered at <a href=""http://www.portlandparks.org/"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a>&rsquo;s Parklane Park with Nike, the Portland Trail Blazers, Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish, Mayor of Portland Ted Wheeler, and guests to celebrate the beginning of the 2018 Portland Basketball Courts Revitalization Project. This three-year project, <a href=""/parks/article/688863"">announced in June</a>, will refresh and upgrade outdoor basketball courts in up to 30 Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites &ndash; including Parklane Park, one of the first to be revitalized &ndash; thanks to a more than $1 million donation by Nike and the Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portlanders are rightfully proud of our world-class parks and recreation system. And basketball courts are a place where people of all ages and backgrounds gather and play,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;Thanks to our strong partnership with Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers, our courts are getting a makeover.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img title=""Parklane Park Basketball Court - Before"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=700105"" alt=""Parklane Park Basketball Court - Before"" width=""50%"" /><img title=""Parklane Park Basketball Court - After"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=700106"" alt=""Parklane Park Basketball Court - After"" width=""50%"" /></p>
<p>From now through 2020, basketball courts in up to 30 parks in Portland will be repaired and refreshed with new paint and a new design featuring the name of the park. Repairs to the court surface and replacement of backboards and hoops will take place as needed. The general contractor for the project is <a href=""http://www.verdenw.org/verde-builds/"">Verde Builds</a>, a program of <a href=""http://www.verdenw.org/"">Verde</a>, an innovative Oregon nonprofit organization that serves communities by building environmental wealth through social enterprise, outreach and advocacy. The builder is local company&nbsp;<a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.pacificace.net_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=7DfhQjPWzR3PmWBQVpi-kw&amp;r=zi8mO1kVGNSBJhG5T-HJaJXOyZPKghZaZ_c-9zBhWpY&amp;m=FOziyzgQB1SqxSQaNs45pGlsXclQxKd8rFf-bqmU2nY&amp;s=QJy-l81wNwyq1HNWWIDAGUR4eQYC0--B3czUZdAsa58&amp;e="">Pacific Ace, LLC</a>.</p>
<p>Nike&rsquo;s contribution to the 2018 Portland Basketball Courts Revitalization Project is a one-time donation of $750,000 to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, administered by Verde, to be used for the revitalization of the courts. The Portland Trail Blazers will donate $100,000 a year for the next three years (2018-2020). Nike and the Trail Blazers will also continue to support youth programming on the courts.</p>
<p><strong>Parklane Youth, Trail Blazer Jusuf Nurki&#263; and Blaze<br /> </strong><br /> This afternoon&rsquo;s project tip-off celebration took place on the recently revitalized basketball court at <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=501"">Parklane Park</a> (SE 155<sup>th</sup> Avenue and Main Street). Children from Rockwood Boys &amp; Girls Club, Hacienda CDC, and Parklane Elementary School participated in fun basketball skill sessions led by Portland Trail Blazer Center Jusuf Nurki&#263; and accompanied by the Blazers&rsquo; mascot, Blaze. Also in attendance was Trail Blazer President and CEO Chris McGowan, Trail Blazers Broadcasting Color Analyst Lamar Hurd, Nike Global Community Impact General Manager Caitlin Morris, and Verde Executive Director Tony DeFalco.</p>
<p>The event also celebrated the news that four more basketball courts at Argay Park, Harney Park, McKenna Park and Trenton Park will open this month, with the other revitalized courts to be ready within the next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to debut the new court design, and begin the full process of restoring and renewing&nbsp;courts across the city. This project means so much to us &ndash; not only is it continuing our long-standing commitment to Portland and the initial court resurfacing project we embarked on more than 15 years ago, it speaks directly to our beliefs in the power of sport to create equal playing fields and that all kids are made to play,&rdquo; said Caitlin Morris, Nike Global Community Impact General Manager.</p>
<p>This project is a continuation of the 2002 Nike Anniversary Project in which the company donated more than $2 million to the Portland Parks Foundation, in celebration of its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, to resurface outdoor basketball courts at 30 park sites in 75 days, as Nike&rsquo;s way of thanking the Portland area for being its home since 1972.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our partnership with Nike continues to be among our strongest, and this effort to refurbish courts around the Portland area to make basketball widely accessible is a major achievement,&rdquo; said Chris McGowan, President and CEO of the Trail Blazers. &ldquo;We thank Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Verde for their pivotal roles, too, in selecting the locations across our community with the most need. The investments of time, effort and resources by all involved will have a positive impact for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Mayor Ted Wheeler, &ldquo;Nike and the Portland Trail Blazers are tremendous community partners, and the City of Portland is extremely grateful for their ongoing commitment to our community, and for their passion to renew our city&rsquo;s basketball courts. This is an incredible gift &ndash; not only for those who live here, but for those who will visit and fall in love with Portland, too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The order in which the original 2002 Nike Anniversary Project parks are being revitalized is determined in large part by a <a href=""https://public.tableau.com/views/ServiceAreaEquityTool2012-16/AbbreviatedView?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes"">Vulnerability Index</a>, a point system based on the estimated aggregate demographics of a service area, as compared to citywide Portland estimates. Demographics of interest include persons under the age of 18, households below poverty status and people of color.</p>
<p>Currently, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Verde are evaluating the courts and determining the revitalization work schedule. Parks that were a part of the original 2002 Nike Anniversary Project and now under consideration for the 2018 Portland Basketball Courts Revitalization Project include (in alphabetical order):</p>

<p><strong>About invasive ivy</strong></p>
<p>The non-native English ivy (<em>Hedera hibernica and Hedera helix)</em> is a pervasive and unwelcome guest in our parks and natural areas.&nbsp; The vines overcome native plant species, and mature ivy vines may threaten trees in many of our forests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation experts say it is important to remove maturing ivy during the fall to reduce the amount of seed produced through the winter, slowing its spread to unaffected areas.&nbsp; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Terwilliger Parkway, Marquam Nature Park and Forest Park have seen vast improvements in tree health in places where ivy was recently cleared.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""/parks/"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a>&nbsp;has been recertified by&nbsp;<a href=""https://salmonsafe.org/"">Salmon-Safe</a>, marking the 15th&nbsp;consecutive year that PP&amp;R has been recognized for its commitment to conservation and environmentally-friendly land management in our parks and natural areas.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Being <a href=""https://salmonsafe.org/"">Salmon-Safe</a> means Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s ecological stewardship practices and environmental restoration work are recognized for excellence in protecting Portland&rsquo;s water quality and habitat.</li>
<li>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) was the first city parks system in the nation to receive the prestigious Salmon-Safe designation.</li>
<li>Salmon-Safe says PP&amp;R is a model for park systems across the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Photo above: Westmoreland Park, the site of a <a href=""/bes/article/439236"">beneficial restoration project</a>. Attached photos show additional PP&amp;R sites and projects that helped the Bureau earn recertification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salmon are found in nearly half of Portland&rsquo;s 300 miles of streams and rivers. Our Salmon-Safe recertification shows Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s commitment to these threatened species and our local waterways,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;From creating new habitat to our daily land management practices, we&rsquo;re proud to be a national leader in the Salmon-Safe movement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salmon-Safe is a nationally-recognized, local non-profit that certifies organizations for their holistic efforts to protect salmon and promote watershed health. The organization has identified PP&amp;R as an example of successful environmental restoration in city park system management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Portland Parks &amp; Recreation demonstrates exceptional environmental leadership in achieving recertification as a Salmon-Safe park system,&rdquo; says Dan Kent, co-founder and Executive Director of Salmon-Safe. &ldquo;As our science team evaluates recent PP&amp;R stewardship actions, it is gratifying to see Portland&rsquo;s parks system continue&mdash;and improve on&mdash;Salmon-Safe practices that help ensure a healthy urban Willamette River watershed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R was first certified as Salmon-Safe in 2004. In 2018, Salmon-Safe&rsquo;s interdisciplinary Science Team assessed the Bureau&rsquo;s natural areas management practices. The team was comprised of experts in salmon habitat and restoration, integrated pest management, and stormwater treatment.&nbsp;Salmon-Safe then unanimously agreed to recertify Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strive for &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland,&rsquo; and that goal of health certainly extends to wildlife and nature as well as people,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is proud to again be leading the way in effective, science-based ecological management and conservation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its report, Salmon-Safe mentioned an impressive cultural change towards even greater ecological stewardship in PP&amp;R operations over the past 15 years. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has implemented high-level restoration efforts at each of its parks which border the Willamette River and Columbia Slough during this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few highlights in Salmon-Safe&rsquo;s report include:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s continued system-wide progress in completing significant (and inspiring!) habitat restoration and enhancement projects over the past six years - projects at Luuwit View Park, Westmoreland Park, South Waterfront Greenway (habitat protection and preservation), Powers Marine Park, Willamette Park, and numerous additional projects along Crystal Springs and Johnson Creek.&nbsp;</li>

<p><strong>About getting married at a PP&amp;R park</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is the proud steward of&nbsp;more than&nbsp;200 parks, gardens, and natural settings&nbsp;that can be reserved for weddings and/or receptions.&nbsp;These lovely settings are the perfect locations for ceremonies and celebrations.&nbsp;Please see the PP&amp;R <a href=""/parks/article/93274"" target=""_blank"">wedding brochure</a>&nbsp;for locations, fees, policies, insurance, and more reservation information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is PP&amp;R using a wedding lottery system?</strong></p>
<p>In October 2017, the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Customer Service Center moved to 111 SW Columbia St. Suite 660. This new, smaller location was not able to accommodate the traditional in-person wedding day reservation line, so a lottery system was determined to be the best way to accommodate wedding hopefuls. PP&amp;R held its first ever wedding lottery in 2017 with positive results and has decided to continue with this system for the coming wedding season.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Portland Parks &amp; Recreation NACAC</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation created our <a href=""/parks/63749"">Native American Community Advisory Council</a> (NACAC) in 2010 in collaboration with Native communities and local tribes. We recognize that the Willamette Valley and Columbia River peoples are the original stewards of this region&rsquo;s land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R is a large land manager in Portland and is concerned with the welfare of public properties and the community interactions with parks. This is a common role that creates a unique relationship between the Native community and PP&amp;R. In recognition of this parallel mission, and the essential value of working with the Native community, a unique council of concerned Native community members, who would inform&nbsp;PP&amp;R about Native cultures and lifeways, was created. Their role is to advise and collaborate about park development, management, and projects.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R recognized their relationship with the Native community by formalizing the Native American Community Advisory Council on November 6, 2013.</p>
<p>The NACAC provides a forum to express values such as sacredness of land, the importance of spiritual and cultural connection to heritage, and&nbsp;the recognition that Indigenous peoples have been here since time immemorial and continue to contribute immeasurably to our nation&rsquo;s, state&rsquo;s, tribes&rsquo;, and city&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<div><hr size=""0"" noshade=""noshade"" /></div>
<p>The NACAC is comprised of local federally recognized tribal members and Native American urban organization members on staff with the City of Portland. The work of this council is to foster collaboration between and among Native communities and the bureau by developing partnerships and strengthening community ties.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Members*</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bow and Arrow Culture Club</li>
<li>Confederated Tribes if Siletz</li>
<li>Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde</li>
<li>METRO</li>
<li>Native American Rehabilitation Association of the NW (NARA)</li>
<li>Native American Youth and Family Center (NAYA)</li>
<li>Portland State University Native Studies</li>

<li>Elizabeth Kennedy-Wong,&nbsp;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</li>
<li>Isabel LaCourse, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</li>
<li>Lorraine Wilson, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</li>
</ul>
<p>*The organizations listed as taking part in the Native American Community Advisory Council (NACAC) comprise some of PP&amp;R's key partners. However, other groups, organizations, and agencies have taken part in the NACAC &ndash; and others are expected to be involved in the future. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation thanks them all for their efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>The goal of NACAC is to contribute Indigenous values, knowledge, and vision to the cultural fabric of Portland while fostering physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health<strong>&nbsp;</strong>by:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing opportunities to educate and practice Native cultures and lifeways within the urban landscape.</li>
<li>Developing best practices to engage with Indigenous peoples in the area.</li>
<li>Collaborating, cooperating, and advising PP&amp;R regarding issues, questions, and potential projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Vision</strong></p>
<p>NACAC wishes to bring about a healing between Indigenous/Native American peoples and all others who live in this region, recognizing that the people are one with the land and consider themselves stewards of it and participating in the well-being of the land. Consistent with&nbsp;<em>Parks 2020 Vision</em>, the NACAC strives to work for a healing of this land, to protect it and to pass it on to future generations, and to&nbsp;leave a legacy for our children that build upon our inheritance.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>WHAT</strong>: Hazeltine Park nature patch celebration and planting party<br /><strong>WHEN</strong>: Saturday, December 1, 2018, 9am-12pm<br /><strong>WHERE</strong>: Hazeltine Park, 5416 SE Flavel Drive, Portland<br /><em>Transit&nbsp;options include nearby TriMet bus stops on lines 71 and 75.</em></p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=704844"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our public parks provide all Portlanders with many opportunities, and one of them is to connect people to nature,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Interim Director Kia Selley. &ldquo;The Hazeltine Park nature patch, only the third of its kind in the city, will provide a fun way to get closer to nature in this neighborhood and serve as a model for expanding access to nature in more parks across Portland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The park is named in honor of longtime Brentwood-Darlington neighborhood residents and park advocates, Dick Hazeltine and his late wife Opal. The Hazeltines have been at the forefront of many neighborhood improvement initiatives over many years, and their tireless efforts and advocacy helped to spur the development of what is now Hazeltine Park. Mr. Hazeltine is expected to speak at Saturday&rsquo;s event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This nature patch is a big improvement and the park feels larger - and will be an even more fun place for kids to play,&rdquo; says Dick Hazeltine, who says he was born just blocks away from the park which bears his family&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff and neighbors have done an outstanding job, and I&rsquo;m so grateful. This project means a lot, coming from someone who started petitions and other efforts for the park over nearly 20 years.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hazeltine Park&rsquo;s nature patch includes heaps of new native and flowering plants, and natural elements for park visitors to explore. Nature patches are helping PP&amp;R develop a new approach of incorporating ecology and nature into Portland&rsquo;s parks. PP&amp;R staff have been busy removing invasive trees and plants, adding split-rail fencing, moving boulders, placing logs, and installing the first series of green, healthy, native plants. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is excited for park neighbors of all ages to assist in this weekend&rsquo;s final improvements and finishing touches. Afterwards, the site will be open to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/74879"">Ecologically Sustainable Landscapes Initiative</a>, the Hazeltine Nature Patch impressively transforms the neighborhood park and makes it more sustainable and appealing. The nature patch is&nbsp;located around the edges of the 1-acre park to maintain the central lawn area for activities. Other elements include a variety of flowering native and ornamental pollinator-friendly plants, the two &ldquo;habitat trees&rdquo; carved with critter niches, an accessible gravel surface for the picnic area, and&nbsp;several nature spots with logs and boulders to gather around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R acquired the park in 2001. Since that time, many passionate neighborhood leaders have been stewards of this park &ndash; caring for it and improving it project by project. The City thanks them all for their continued efforts.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is a nature patch?</strong></p>
<p>Nature patches are spaces within existing parks that are being enhanced to add beautiful natural elements for people and wildlife. A variety of natural materials like native Pacific Northwest plants, logs, boulders and paths will be added to underused areas to encourage people to play and explore. Nesting boxes, flowering plants and other additions will improve the habitat for birds, pollinating insects and wildlife. Nature patches will bring nature into view at neighborhood parks, adding beautiful greenspaces that are home to birds, bees, and butterflies. Besides Hazeltine, nature patches are complete at Alberta and Wilshire Parks, with a site at Gabriel Park in progress. Several other nature patch projects around the city are also planned over the next few years. The goals of the program include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide spaces for people to explore, play, and interact with nature</li>
<li>Create ecologically robust landscapes that support native pollinators within&nbsp;developed&nbsp;parks</li>
<li>Provide environmental education and stewardship opportunities</li>
<li>Increase soil and plant health, and expand the diversity of natural landscapes within parks</li>
<li>Foster community partnerships and PP&amp;R collaboration</li>
<li>Decrease maintenance inputs over time&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Portland Parks Foundation (PPF) welcomes Randy Gragg as the new Executive Director. Gragg succeeds Jeff Anderson who recently retired from the role. Bringing a dynamic background in journalism, urban planning, and advocacy, Gragg will lead the organization that serves as the chief philanthropic partner for the City of Portland&rsquo;s Parks &amp; Recreation.</p>
<p>For nearly 30 years, Gragg has helped to shape conversations about the city of Portland&rsquo;s spaces and culture. His leadership and advocacy has helped champion a number of public parks projects, including Eastbank Esplanade, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and Lawrence Halprin&rsquo;s Portland Open Space Sequence, also known as Lovejoy Fountain, Pettyrove Park, and Keller Fountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland Parks Foundation is proud of the impacts we've made on Portland&rsquo;s Parks system, most recently the Barbara Walker Footbridge over Burnside, opening next summer,&rdquo; said Mary Ruble, the foundation&rsquo;s Board Chair. &rdquo;With Randy Gragg at the helm of the Foundation, our goal is to increase our visibility and expand our range of public/private partnerships to build a stronger and more vibrant parks and recreation system throughout Portland. We are honored to have Randy join us, and look to his vision and experience to take us to new heights.&ldquo;</p>
<p>As a journalist, Gragg served as Editor-in-Chief at Portland Monthly Magazine from 2009-2013 and as a columnist and reporter at the Oregonian for 17 years. More recently he has developed exhibitions and public programs with Design Week Portland. From 2013-2017, Gragg was the Executive Director of the University of Oregon&rsquo;s John Yeon Center for Architecture and the Landscape where he developed a major 2017 retrospective for the Portland Art Museum on the seminal Oregon architect and landscape designer John Yeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is entering an exciting era,&rdquo; Gragg said. &ldquo;The city is growing dramatically, not just in numbers, but with deepening cultural diversity, creativity, and awareness. With the Parks Foundation&rsquo;s 16-year legacy of good work to build on, we&rsquo;re ready to partner with Portland&rsquo;s wide-ranging communities to create new parks and programs, refresh those we have, even rethink what a park is and where it can be.""</p>
<p>Gragg was a Loeb Fellow at Harvard University&rsquo;s Graduate School of Design and an inaugural National Arts Journalism Fellow at Columbia University. His volunteer affiliations include roles as a board member with Pioneer Courthouse Square and the Alumni Council Loeb Fellowship at Harvard University. As board chair of the Halprin Landscape Conservancy, he co-led the development of an innovative $4.5-million public/private partnership to restore Halprin&rsquo;s world-renowned fountain plazas.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation recently came under the leadership of City Commissioner Nick Fish, who will also be the Foundation&rsquo;s City Council liaison. &ldquo;Randy is a respected community leader and will bring a strong vision during this time of growth for the Portland Parks Foundation,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;I look forward to building on our longstanding partnership and expanding Portland&rsquo;s world-class parks and recreation system.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>About Portland Parks Foundation</strong><br />The Portland Parks Foundation is devoted to building a thriving and accessible parks system for a healthy, sustainable, and creative Portland. We are the chief philanthropic partner for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Through leadership, partnership, and philanthropy, we advance the City of Portland&rsquo;s commitment to excellence, equity, inclusion, and good stewardship of our public parks.

<p><strong>POSTED DECEMBER 20, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute; announce $2 million in <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (SDCs) dedicated toward completing the first phase of Gateway Green. The funds will allow the development of the innovative new park, 25 acres of formerly unused land at the confluence of I-84 and I-205, to move forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A $1 million <a href=""http://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/community-nature-projects-get-52-million-boost-metro-grants"">Metro grant</a> awarded in 2014, and $1.3 million in cash and in-kind contributions (public and private) raised by the non-profit <a href=""http://www.gatewaygreenpdx.org/"">Friends of Gateway Green</a> (FoGG) have also funded the project. Those contributions, plus the SDC funds earmarked by Commissioner Fritz and Director Abbat&eacute;, will allow Phase 1 of the Gateway Green project to continue.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal""><strong>The SDC funding will provide Gateway Green with an expanded hiking trails network, enhanced with small natural play area, along with habitat restoration, improved access, and further off-road biking opportunities. </strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased to be part of this unique partnership between two local governments and one dedicated non-profit, the Friends of Gateway Green,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Gateway Green will be a regional destination in park-deficient east Portland, and a working example of how active recreation can be balanced with natural restoration and preservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gateway Green will be easily accessible to visitors, including the 26,000 Portlanders who live within 1 1/2 miles of the site, via a connection to the I-205 multi-use path. Metro recently estimated that 250,000 people annually pass by&nbsp;Gateway&nbsp;Green via the 16.5-mile-long path. Gateway&nbsp;Green could be a key&nbsp;connection point for&nbsp;cycling within the city, as it also lies at the intersection of the future Sullivan&rsquo;s Gulch Trail.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">Gateway Green functions as a regional off-road cycling destination, a site for passive recreation, for reflection, and as a key amenity for east Portland neighborhoods and communities including Maywood Park, Madison South, Montavilla, Parkrose, Parkrose Heights, Sumner, Woodland Park and Hazelwood. 138,000 or 24% of Portland&rsquo;s population currently reside in east Portland. By 2040, east Portland is projected to grow by 90,000, yet that part of town lacks the same access to parks and green enjoyed by other parts of the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the inspiration to the start of construction, it has taken 10 years,&rdquo; says Ted Gilbert of Friends of Gateway Green. &nbsp;&ldquo;Without the belief, commitment and leadership of the City of Portland and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, it would never have come together. &nbsp;We sincerely believe that what started as a grassroots effort will prove to be a gift for east Portland and the entire region. My thanks to all our funding partners and to FoGG&rsquo;s Linda Robinson for her tireless advocacy for parks in general and those in east Portland in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""p13"">FoGG recently completed an ambitious crowdfunding campaign to round out their fundraising efforts. FoGG&rsquo;s efforts allowed for the construction of the first off-road cycling trails at Gateway Green, which are being completed this winter.</p>
<p class=""xmsonormal"">&ldquo;Friends of Gateway Green came up with the idea of developing the site,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;They raised the necessary funds to get the project off the ground, and now Gateway Green will be a source of pride for a diverse and fast-growing part of Portland. The park will help us to improve equity in parks services, and is a shining example of smart land use. Our sincere thanks to Metro, the Friends of Gateway Green, and all who contributed to this laudable effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""p13"">Metro awarded a $1 million Nature in Neighborhoods grant to FoGG in 2014. Thanks to voter investments since 2006, Metro&rsquo;s Nature in Neighborhoods capital grants have helped to acquire land, restore habitat and streams, transform neighborhoods and promote equity. Nature in Neighborhoods grants support partnerships so that neighborhood groups, nonprofits, government agencies and others can boost access and improve nature close to home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Future phases of construction over the next few years will enhance habitat and access to Gateway Green, and may include elements such as site design; public involvement; permitting; and bidding documents, restrooms and drinking fountains, invasive plant treatments, and land grading.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding and enhancing other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City.&nbsp; Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it.&nbsp; PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty. PP&amp;R has additional and unfunded growth needs of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>

<p class=""p12"">(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p class=""p11""><em>Metro grant, System Development Charges to fund key projects, build on PDC&rsquo;s previous investment and private donations</em></p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz makes two major funding announcements regarding the future of the iconic garden located in east Portland off SE Foster and 122<sup>nd</sup> Ave.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.oregonmetro.gov/"">Metro</a> has awarded PP&amp;R and Leach Botanical Garden with a $188,000 Nature in Neighborhoods grant (confirmed by Metro Council this week) to develop its new pollinator garden. This grant includes a 2:1 match designated by Commissioner Fritz and Director Abbat&eacute; of $376,000 in <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a>.</li>
<li>Additionally, strong interest, robust fundraising efforts and significant pledges cultivated by the Leach Garden Friends group of supporters have now spurred Commissioner Fritz and Director Abbat&eacute; to offer a challenge to Leach Garden Friends: if they are able to raise a total of $1.26 million overall, then Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will supplement the remaining funds to see the entire project through: $4.9 million.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""Default"">These additional funds help fund other aspects of a <a href=""http://www.leachgarden.org/download_file/711/"">transformative project</a> at Leach Botanical Garden, a unique regional destination.</p>
<p class=""p14""><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=621050"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""640"" /></p>
<p class=""p14"">Photo: supporters of Leach Botanical Garden applaud Commissioner Fritz's announcement at a December, 2016 meeting.</p>
<p class=""p14"">Portland Development Commission (PDC) has already contributed nearly $2 million from Lents Urban Renewal Area funds.</p>
<p class=""p14"">""I am grateful for the support from Metro, PDC, and Leach Garden stakeholders,"" says Commissioner Fritz. ""Fundraising by the non-profit Leach Garden Friends, additional SDC funds that I am committing as a match, and strong advocacy by the East Portland Action Plan and other east Portland grassroots supporters will help create a world-class botanical gem. The Master Plan envisions creation of spectacular opportunities for economic development, educational recreation facilities, cultural amenities and community gatherings in park-deficient east Portland. Just as the Washington Park Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, and Lan Su Chinese Garden on the west side draw visitors from around the region and serve as attractions for tourists, I believe Leach has the potential to create a similar scale of excitement and interest as a unique and treasured park asset on the east side of the City.&nbsp; Investments at Leach will help reduce the disparities between park services in east and west Portland.""</p>
<p class=""p13"">&ldquo;The potential of this special place as an urban sanctuary is immense,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;It will be a destination for science, for cultural enhancement, and for connecting people to both each other - and to nature in the city.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;&ldquo;PDC's investment in Leach reflects our commitment to provide high quality amenities to East Portland and expand opportunities for engagement with the diverse local community,&rdquo; says Executive Director Kimberly Branam. &ldquo;The Leach Botanical Garden holds the potential for positive economic development impact, particularly in the Foster industrial area, by offering access to green and open spaces that enhances employers' ability to attract and retain talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;The Leach Botanical Garden Development Plan, achieved through extensive recent public involvement, calls for a pedestrian trail network, including connections between the Upper and Lower gardens, a woodland hillside garden with an aerial &ldquo;tree walk&rdquo;, a pollinator garden, public gathering spaces for educational and cultural opportunities, water-efficient landscaping and durable, diverse and aesthetically pleasing plants and materials. Metro, the Portland area&rsquo;s regional government, has designated their grant funding towards the new pollinator garden.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;Thanks to voter investments since 2006, Metro&rsquo;s Nature in Neighborhoods capital grants have helped to acquire land, restore habitat and streams, transform neighborhoods and promote equity. Nature in Neighborhoods grants support partnerships so that neighborhood groups, nonprofits, government agencies and others can boost access and improve nature close to home.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;&ldquo;Metro is pleased to help the improvements at Leach,&rdquo; says Metro Councilor Shirley Craddick, &ldquo;so that the Garden can grow and continue to thrive as a place for beauty, relaxation and reflection.&nbsp; We know this vision was conceived when PP&amp;R acquired the site more than 30 years ago, and it is exciting to know that at Nature in Neighborhoods grant can help the vision become a reality.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;PP&amp;R funding for the projects at Leach Botanical Garden comes not from General Fund Tax dollars, but from System Development Charges (SDCs).&#8239; These are one-time fees assessed on new development. SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth. Park SDCs are restricted by law towards expanding capacity only (rather than to maintain or repair existing park facilities).&#8239; &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p14"">&nbsp;&ldquo;When I was Commissioner-in-Charge of Parks, I fell in love with Leach Botanical Garden, a jewel of east Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;It is exciting to hear of this generous Metro grant, and of Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s challenge. I offer thanks to her, and my support to the Leach Board and Leach Friends as they work to raise the funds needed to move forward on this key project.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""p13"">&nbsp;&ldquo;When the late Charles Jordan was Commission-in-charge of Parks,&rdquo; says Leach Garden Executive Director David Porter, &ldquo;he came to Leach before it was developed, and is said to have remarked that the property was &lsquo;a little jewel&rsquo;, and that &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t let it go.&rsquo; Of course, he was completely correct. And thanks to the City of Portland and Metro, we have the finish line for this catalytic project in sight. I look forward to robust fundraising efforts.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Urban Forestry division (UF), coordinating closely with the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) is working to address areas where has ice and snow have resulted in downed trees impacting roads, rights-of-way and/or private and park property. PBOT and PP&amp;R combined have received reports of around 260 distinct locations impacted by downed tree issues since the winter blast began last week.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=620626"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""399.84375"" /></p>
<p><em>Photo: a landslide and downed trees force a portion of NW Cornell Rd., near the Audubon Society of Portland, to remain closed. PBOT, PP&amp;R and utility crews are working together to mitigate hazards and debris so the road can reopen.</em></p>
<p>As of 11am on Monday, December, 12, 2016, Urban Forestry crews had addressed more than 160 of these tree emergencies, and around 100 remaining issues will be investigated today. &nbsp;The first priority for UF tree inspectors and work crews is to ensure that all hazards in a given area are mitigated - both on the ground and overhead in the surrounding trees. Next is to work clearing roads &ndash; major arteries and highways are all reported as clear; UF crews will be working on area streets which allow people to get to and from their homes and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City is very proud of and grateful for the hard work and dedication of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and PBOT staff during and after the storm,&rdquo; says Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We are thankful that there are no reported injuries to our staff while they responded to emergencies to clear our roads of dangerous tree debris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Urban Forestry calls the recent winter weather one of the biggest event to impact trees citywide this decade. PP&amp;R arborists and tree inspectors responded as soon as reports of downed trees began coming in last week, sometimes working until 3am and returning to work around 7am to address tree emergencies citywide.</p>
<p>Currently PP&amp;R has five tree inspectors and three crews of arborists out in the city, working as hard as they can. The focus for work crews is on safety and access, rather than immediate clean-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dedicated Urban Forestry workers are persevering with the extensive and difficult work, and we offer them our continued thanks,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We have had extensive coordination and cooperation with PBOT. If you've already reported a tree issue, please know that we will get to it, and thanks for your patience as crews address the hundreds of separate issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weather forecasts are calling for the possibility of <em>more</em> snow later this week. To help prevent further weather-related tree issues, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Urban Forestry urges homeowners to have their trees trimmed, maintained and regularly assessed using Certified Arborists. And drivers and people on foot should always use extra caution while driving or walking in winter weather conditions. If you come across a downed tree or limb, look UP as well as down at the ground.&nbsp; Proceed carefully, knowing that the tree branches came from somewhere nearby; and potential other hazards may remain.</p>
<p>If anyone sees a new issue of hazardous tree in a City right-of-way, please email <a href=""mailto:trees@portlandoregon.gov"">trees@portlandoregon.gov</a>, or call 503-823-TREE. &nbsp;You will need the site address, a good description of the issue, and kindly provide your name and contact info in case of any questions.</p>
<p>-Please visit the <a href=""/parks/38294"">Urban Forestry website</a> or consult a practicing certified arborist for helpful tips on maintenance and information on species that are best suited for our area when planting trees</p>
<p>- Neighbors are urged to please consult an International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) certified arborist to care for your trees, including street trees, adjacent property owner is required to maintain street trees in line with City Code.</p>
<p>- PP&amp;R has <a href=""/trees/article/424016"">a list of local tree care providers</a> on our <a href=""/parks/38294"">Urban Forestry website</a>.

2016,619707,Commissioner Fritz announces funding for PP&R's Errol Heights Park enhancement,2,,2016-12-14 23:16:37 UTC,2016-12-02 18:21:00 UTC,A,System Development Charges from development revenue go towards realizing SE Portland park’s vision,"<p><strong>POSTED DECEMBER 2, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announces she is designating $5.3 million in funding towards transforming <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=114"">Errol Heights Park</a> into the hybrid natural area and developed park envisioned in the 2005 park <a href=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=112401"">Master Plan</a>. Errol Heights Park comprises more than 14 acres between SE 45<sup>th</sup> to 52<sup>nd</sup> Avenues and from SE Harney Street to SE Tenino Street in the Brentwood-Darlington neighborhood. The Woodstock and Ardenwald/Johnson Creek neighborhoods are also adjacent to the south and west of the park.</p>
<p><strong>1,477 households are within a half-mile walking distance of Errol Heights Park</strong>, making this project one which significantly enhances parks services to area neighbors.<strong></strong></p>

<p>Photo: Volunteers with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Friends of Errol Heights, Friends of Trees and Johnson Creek Watershed Council&nbsp;planted native trees and shrubs in a newly acquired parcel of the Errol Heights natural area on November 19, 2016. Native plants support a diversity of insects and wildlife, and provide cleaner air and water for all Portlanders. Photos are courtesy of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Portland, OR.</p>
<p>Funding for the next step in Errol Heights Park&rsquo;s development comes not from General Fund Tax dollars, but from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (SDCs).&nbsp; These are one-time fees assessed on new development. SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth. Park SDCs are restricted by law towards expanding capacity only (rather than to maintain or repair existing park facilities).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited that Errol Heights Park will now have even more opportunities for recreation and relaxation,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The park has a unique combination of assets, including a <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=1419"">Portland community garden</a> and a natural area. Moving forward on transforming a portion of the site into its long-desired developed park will enhance the neighborhood and the livability of our city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The current allocation of $5.3 million will allow Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to realize the first phase of desired improvements to the park and natural area. While it is yet to be determined what improvements will be included in Phase 1 (pending upcoming public involvement with the community), some funds will be used to improve the streets around the park. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Improvements in Phase 1 of the Errol Heights Master Plan may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional and improved paths</li>
<li>Enhancements to the natural area portion of the park</li>
<li>A grass lawn and new plantings</li>
<li>Street improvements</li>
<li>Amenities for play and/or sports</li>
<li>A picnic and/or gathering area</li>
<li>A Portland Loo or other restroom facility</li>
</ul>
<p>Other phases to realize the park&rsquo;s full vision may be possible in the future, depending on funding. Commissioner Fritz and PP&amp;R aim to achieve the full vision of the Errol Heights Master Plan, but recognize that the full park development will need to be completed in phases. Public involvement and the design phase of the park will begin by summer, 2017.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is growing fast, and more than ever, our neighbors need places to play, to pause, places where we can connect with nature,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The vision of Errol Heights Park is special in that it will be a place for both active play and for relaxing in a natural setting. We thank our Commissioner-in-Charge, our PP&amp;R staff, and the Friends groups and volunteers who help enhance our parks and natural areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Volunteer groups such as Friends of Errol Heights, Friends of Trees and Johnson Creek Watershed Council have been dedicated stewards of the Errol Heights property for many years. A whopping 150 members of these groups came out to plant native trees and shrubs in a newly acquired parcel of the Errol Heights natural area on November 19, 2016.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having volunteered countless hours at Errol Heights over the years, my neighbors and I are delighted that Commissioner Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation are moving forward to help the Errol Heights Park become what we&rsquo;ve envisioned as a community,&rdquo; says Paul Ciri with the Friends of Errol Heights. &ldquo;This funding is a tremendous start on the road to realizing the park&rsquo;s unique vision, one which has a wide appeal for all park visitors. We extend our sincerest thanks to the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding and enhancing other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City.&nbsp; Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it.&nbsp; PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty. PP&amp;R has additional and unfunded growth needs of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>One of largest inventories of city trees in the U.S. will help guide Portland&rsquo;s urban forestry management.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Urban Forestry staff and more than 1300 volunteers have surveyed and mapped nearly every planted street tree (planted in public rights-of-way, rather than on private property) in Portland &ndash; almost 220,000 in all, covering all 96 of the city&rsquo;s neighborhoods. The effort is key to help inform how PP&amp;R manages Portland&rsquo;s urban forest going forward.</p>
<p>(Photo above: a Street Tree Inventory volunteer smiles as she measures a Portland tree. This endeavor will help guide Portland's urban forestry management.)</p>
<p>Trees have also been measured, identified, and each one&rsquo;s health rated as part of the City&rsquo;s first comprehensive inventory of street trees. Findings from the tree inventory, which was completed in September, will be presented at the 2016 Tree Inventory Summit, a free public event:</p>
<p><strong>What:</strong> &nbsp;2016 Tree Inventory Summit</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, Nov. 5<sup>th</sup>, from 8:30 a.m. &ndash; 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href=""/parks/60409"">Mt. Scott Community Center</a> 5530 SE 72nd Ave.</p>
<p>Register for the event <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfWrbh9QC5IDo987gIvvSDicFXpSRf_3H70PikqXcSjMldGog/viewform"">here</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees are a vital part of our city,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;They improve our health by cleaning the air we breathe and reducing summer heat impacts, provide habitat for wildlife, and make our neighborhoods more walkable and beautiful.&nbsp; I am pleased that the Urban Forestry staff and our valued volunteers worked so hard on the Street Tree Inventory. Their work will help inform and guide stewardship of this valuable public asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>All 96 Portland neighborhoods inventoried</strong></p>
<p>More than 1,300 volunteers, in cooperation with PP&amp;R Urban Forestry staff, systematically gathered information on street trees in all of Portland&rsquo;s nearly 100 neighborhoods, one tree at a time. Workers and volunteers spent approximately 17,000 hours on the project from 2010 through September, 2016. Reports for individual neighborhoods are already available on <a href=""/parks/trees"">Urban Forestry&rsquo;s web page</a>. Residents are encouraged to check-out the information for their local street trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partial surveys of street trees were done in Portland in 1938 and again in the 1970s, but this is the most comprehensive and in-depth look at our street trees ever,&rdquo; says City Forester Jenn Cairo. &ldquo;Besides Portland, New York is the only city which has attempted anything of this magnitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cairo says especially significant is that all the inventory data has been entered into a geographic information system (GIS) database, which can be mapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This makes it easier to analyze, study, and share the information with other city bureaus, researchers, and the public,&rdquo; adds Cairo.</p>
<p>Preliminary findings from the survey have already been influencing the city&rsquo;s tree-related policies. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some lower-income neighborhoods and areas with less tree canopy have benefited from more funding from the Urban Forestry <a style=""background-color: initial; font-size: 12px;"" href=""/parks/article/478859"">tree stewardship program</a><span style=""background-color: initial; font-size: 12px;"">. Strategic tree planting efforts and tree maintenance activities in these neighborhoods help to improve and increase the overall tree canopy for the long term.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>Portland is vulnerable to significant tree losses from pests and diseases as a result of a very high count of maple trees along city streets.&nbsp; Urban Forestry now requires property owners to plant alternative species when replacing and planting new street trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Given the low percentage of evergreen trees being planted, Urban Forestry has increased the number of evergreens on its <a href=""/trees/66682"">Approved Planting Lists</a> from a handful to more than 20, and is encouraging evergreen planting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working together with so many volunteers from diverse backgrounds, we were able to gain so much more understanding about street trees everywhere in the city,&rdquo; says Angie DiSalvo, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Urban Forestry&rsquo;s Outreach and Science Supervisor. &ldquo;The data produced is empowering residents to take science-based actions to improve the urban forest right where they live.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key findings from the inventory include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Portland&rsquo;s street trees provide $28.6 million worth of environmental and other services to the city annually, and have an overall value of nearly $753 million.</li>
<li>Maples and trees in the rose family - mainly cherries, plums, hawthorns, and crabapples &ndash; dominate street plantings at levels well above what forestry officials consider healthy. A lack of tree species diversity means the city&rsquo;s forest is more susceptible to large-scale tree loss</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Neighborhoods in east Portland tend to have more empty spaces than other parts of the city, however street tree populations in these areas are more diverse and contain more desirable evergreen species: Citywide, evergreens make up just 8% of street trees, however in east Portland they make up nearly twice that.</p>
<p>There is an increasing trend to plant smaller-form trees in sites which could accommodate larger trees &ndash; larger-form trees offer greater long-term environmental and community benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know from other research that a majority of Portland&rsquo;s neighborhoods don&rsquo;t yet meet the City&rsquo;s stated goal of raising the tree canopy level from the current 29% to 33%,&rdquo; says Cairo. &ldquo;The inventory findings pinpoint street tree planting trends that are indicators of where neighborhoods are making progress, where additional efforts need to be made, and what the most effective actions to boost canopy might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation <a href=""/parks/38294"">Urban Forestry</a> is responsible for management of the city&rsquo;s urban forest including tree policy and permitting, responding 24/7 to tree emergencies in city streets, forest assessment and planning, and ensuring urban forest services for current and future Portland residents.</p>

<p><strong>CAUTION URGED, SURVEY FIELDS BEFORE PLAYING</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that city-owned athletic fields and ball fields will remain open for use as of Monday, October 31, 2016; but for permitted play only.&nbsp; Drop-in use will not be allowed due to unsafe conditions that could impact user safety and field integrity. Gabriel Park&rsquo;s Field #2 is still unplayable for all visitors at this time, due to continued standing water. PP&amp;R has consulted with youth soccer leagues and other major stakeholders in making the determination that fields can remain open for use only by people who have secured permits, which are for games scheduled for weekends only for the foreseeable future. The bureau will reevaluate field conditions periodically.</p>
<p>Please note: the bureau stresses that permit holders and players must make the determination if their fields are safe to use. Playing sports on fields with standing water or excessive mud can be unsafe.</p>

<p>(Pictured: photo of the muddy soccer goal at PP&amp;R's Rose City Park)</p>
<p>Due to the continued effects of recent heavy rains, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) grass playing fields were closed on several recent occasions this Fall, including from Wednesday, October 26 through Friday, October 28, 2016. Sustained rains and wet conditions across the city left many PP&amp;R athletic fields with standing water, mud, slippery turf, and other poor conditions that may impact athletes' safety. Conditions have also hampered the ability for PP&amp;R maintenance crews to care for the fields. Although recent precipitation levels are not as heavy as they were earlier in the month, the relatively low temperatures and lack of sun kept fields from being able to dry out.</p>
<p>This modified closure impacts the bureau's grass fields and events which PP&amp;R had permitted at Portland Public Schools facilities. The closures do and have NOT impacted synthetic turf fields, which are designed for all-weather play.</p>
<p>The forecast is starting to appear more typical in the coming weeks, and the Fall sports season is coming to a close. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation turf experts stressed the importance of preserving the grass, noting that damage inflicted now will be much harder to repair later on when more users are expected to use the fields. <br /> <br /> People who secured field permits for games that could not be played will receive credit, determined during PP&amp;R's end-of-the-season assessment. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation makes safety its top priority, though we understand some athletes were disappointed by the bureau's need to close the fields on various dates.</p>
<p>Meteorologists note that Portland has received almost 8 inches of rain this month (7.85"" at PDX) - the third highest amount ever recorded for Portland in the month of October.&nbsp; The average rainfall for October in the Rose City is just three inches.</p>

<p><strong>What: </strong>A free community celebration for the grand reopening of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Matt Dishman Community Center pool, the second completed <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a> project.</p>
<p><strong>Where: </strong>Matt Dishman Community Center (MDCC), 77 NE Knott St. Parking is limited, please allow time to park nearby.</p>
<p><strong>When: </strong>Friday, October 21, 6:00pm-8:00pm</p>
<p>All are welcome to join Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Service Manager Eileen Argentina, new MDCC Director Amourie Downing, neighbors and friends to celebrate the grand reopening of the Matt Dishman Community Center&rsquo;s pool.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is pleased to announce that Matt Dishman Community Center&rsquo;s pool has re-opened,<strong> </strong>following a temporary closure for major renovations.<strong> </strong>This Parks Replacement Bond construction project began in late August 2016 and involved repairs and overhauls to major mechanical systems and pool materials, as well as doubling the capacity of the spa (which will reopen soon!) to accommodate 20 people. The old spa had been leaking 1,000 gallons of water per day.</p>
<p>Thanks to overwhelming voter support of the <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, PP&amp;R was able to complete the project at <a href=""/parks/60933"">Matt Dishman Community Center</a>, the second of many other Bond projects citywide. Parks Replacement Bond projects are repairing some of the most critical components of the City&rsquo;s park system. In addition to repair and replacement work on the pool, work was also completed on the spa and the spa capacity was expanded. Funding for the expansion of the spa&rsquo;s capacity came from PP&amp;R System Development Charges, or SDCs (revenue from construction development in the city, rather than General Fund tax dollars or Bond funds).</p>
<p>The project at Matt Dishman included repairs and replacement of major swimming pool components to address gaps behind the plaster and cracks underneath the pool floor.&nbsp;The three existing fiberglass sand filters for the pool have also been replaced with a single, high-efficiency filter.</p>
<p>A new, larger spa is in place which can serve up to 20 users, and will be in service in the near future. Mechanical systems including piping, filters, chemical controllers, and chlorine systems were replaced, and a new ultra-violet filtering system has been added.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;For years, our staff did the best they could to keep the pool running, despite the crumbling infrastructure,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;But patchwork repairs to old equipment that had exceeded its useful life was simply no longer viable. This Bond-funded project ensures that the Matt Dishman pool and spa will continue to be community assets. We again thank Portland voters for their overwhelming support for the Parks Replacement Bond, which made this important project possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly 20 more Parks Replacement Bond projects will be breaking ground in the next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so gratifying to see Matt Dishman&rsquo;s gleaming new pool and spa, amenities which offer so much to so many visitors,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The pool is a treasured asset for the community, and we thank all Portlanders for backing the Parks Replacement Bond. This, and the many other Bond projects underway, help us to provide places for recreation, health, and livability, which are at the core of our mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Matt Dishman Pool schedule can be found on PP&amp;R&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/60933"">website</a> or by calling 503-823-3673. Recreational swimming, swim lessons, and fitness classes are all available again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Parks Replacement Bond</strong></p>
<p>The Parks Replacement Bond was passed with the support of over 74% of voters in November 2014. Its primary focus is on repair and replacement of the most critical needs in the parks system. The total bond is for $68 million, and work has begun on the first list of 33 Bond projects citywide.</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which takes aim at a $248M funding gap for major maintenance needs over the next ten years. Further, PP&amp;R anticipates $472M in unfunded <em>growth</em> needs during that period. That adds up to a $720M funding gap over the next decade, which Commissioner Fritz will continue to work with City Council to address. Currently, 20% of people living in Portland do NOT have access to a park or natural area within a 15-minute walk, and the bureau is working hard to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;.&nbsp; PP&amp;R data show that pools are one of the bureau&rsquo;s most widely utilized features, and we recognize their importance to the community.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that with one exception, all city-owned athletic and ball fields remain open for play as of Monday, October 24, 2016, after a closure due to safety concerns and saturated conditions related to heavy rain. The sole exception is Gabriel Park's Field #2, which remains closed due to standing water. <br /> <br /> PP&amp;R will continue to evaluate conditions on all grass fields, including Gabriel Park's Field #2, and make determinations on if the facilities can remain open for use, with user safety in mind. <br /> <br /> All grass fields were closed from Friday, October 14 through Friday, October 21, 2016. The field closure impacted only grass fields at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites, as well as events which PP&amp;R had permitted at Portland Public Schools facilities. The citywide closure did NOT impact synthetic turf fields, which are designed for all-weather play. <br /> <br /> During recent heavy rains, wet conditions on fields citywide left many PP&amp;R athletic fields with standing water, mud, slippery turf, and other poor conditions that may have impacted athletes' safety. The conditions also hampered the ability for PP&amp;R maintenance crews to care for the fields. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation turf experts stressed the importance of preserving the grass at this time so that fall sports seasons can be completed on those fields in the coming weeks. <br /> <br /> All people who had been granted permits for canceled games and events on PP&amp;R athletic and ball fields will have their money refunded.

<p>Portland Parks &amp;&nbsp;Recreation announces that Vincent Johnson is the new Assistant Director for Portland Public Golf. Johnson, a Portland native and professional player, joins longtime Golf&nbsp;Manager John Zoller to oversee the City&rsquo;s six public golf courses and to expand the game of&nbsp;golf&rsquo;s appeal and reach.

<p>Johnson began his position on October 13, 2016. He is one of the most accomplished players to ever come out of Portland. Johnson earned his finance degree, with a minor in music, in just three years while on a golf scholarship at Oregon State University. Johnson is a professional golfer who has competed in tournaments on the PGA Tour and on the Web.com tour. He won the 2010 Long Beach Open, one of the biggest mini tour events on the West Coast, competing as a professional.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent has an amazing ability to assess a course or golf facility, and key in on elements that can help it serve the needs of both established and aspiring golfers,&rdquo; says Portland Public Golf Manager John Zoller. &ldquo;He has all kinds of fresh ideas, and is remarkably selfless. Vincent wants to give back to the sport, and to the City, which have helped shape his life so much to this point.&nbsp; This is an exciting time for golf in Portland, as we continue our century of service with efforts towards making the lifelong sport more appealing, accessible and enjoyable for our growing and changing city. Vincent knows the game of golf and the golf industry inside and out. He will help with making golf a more attractive to historically underrepresented communities &ndash; including communities of color - and make equitable recreation option for our current and future generations of Portland golfers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An accomplished concert pianist, Johnson has also begun work on his MBA at Oregon State. Johnson won his first tournament, a five-hole event at Glendoveer Golf course in Portland, at age 8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like so many Portlanders, my golf story and Portland Public Golf will be forever linked,&rdquo; says Johnson. &ldquo;I've experienced every human emotion on our City courses, from the joy of victory to tear-inducing defeat, Portland Public Golf helped provide the foundation for my collegiate and professional golf career.&nbsp;I hope to help create more stories like mine, as well as to guide aspiring youth and players of color to become involved with the game. No matter how people may have viewed golf historically, we aim to make the sport open and appealing to all. I look forward to helping all Portlanders enjoy the lifelong recreational pastime, and all the other opportunities the game can offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Public Golf offers affordable, quality golf to Portland's residents and visitors. Our five golf courses are conveniently located around the metro area to offer unparalleled access to our nationally recognized courses: <a href=""/parks/63563"">Eastmoreland</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/63574"">Heron Lakes - Great Blue</a>, <a href=""/parks/63574"">Heron Lakes - Greenback</a>, <a href=""/parks/63565"">RedTail</a>, <a href=""/parks/63566"">Rose City</a>,&nbsp;and the newly acquired <a href=""/parks/65570"">Colwood Golf Course</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end, no matter where we go with our golf, it all starts with a beginning,&rdquo; says Johnson. &ldquo;It all starts with a place to play.&nbsp;It's an honor to fill the role of Assistant Golf Director for the City of Portland. I couldn't be more excited to go to work for a city that has given me so much and to share a game that I am so deeply passionate about.&nbsp;We are close to the 100th year of Portland Public Golf, and I cannot wait to help usher in the next century for all Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The non-native English ivy (<em>Hedera hibernica and Hedera helix)</em> is a pervasive and unwelcome guest in our parks and natural areas. The vines overcome native plant species, and mature ivy vines may threaten trees in many of our forests.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation experts say it is important to remove maturing ivy during the fall to reduce the amount of seed produced through the winter, slowing its spread to unaffected areas. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Terwilliger Wildlands, Marquam Nature Park and Forest Park have seen vast improvements in tree health in places where ivy was recently cleared.</p>
<p>No Ivy Day work parties run from 9am to 12pm followed by gatherings for food, raffles and celebration from 12pm-1:30pm at<strong> </strong>three sites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forest Park (Lower Macleay entrance at 2960 NW Upshur)</li>

2016,591668,PP&R designates $3 million towards Thomas Cully Park,2,,2016-10-17 17:22:22 UTC,2016-09-23 16:26:00 UTC,A,Newest city park to serve more than 400 families without current access to parks; to be built by a unique public/private partnership,"<p><strong>POSTED SEPTEMBER 23, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Newest city park to serve more than 400 families without current access to parks; to be built by a unique public/private partnership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Commissioner Fritz promises $3 million more in development revenue (System Development Charges) for new park in diverse Cully neighborhood</li>
<li>More than 400 families to gain access to a local park for the first time thanks to public/community partnership</li>
<li>Donations are needed to close the final funding gap and make the park possible</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""content-right"" title=""Graphic showing that Cully Park remains only $1M short of its fundraising goal."" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=591666"" alt=""Graphic showing that Cully Park remains only $1M short of its fundraising goal."" width=""300"" /></p>
<p><em>Photo: graphic showing that now Cully Park remains only $1M short of its fundraising goal.</em></p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, joined by Cully neighborhood representatives and Verde, announced $3 million in additional funding for the future Thomas Cully Park, NE 75th just north of Killingsworth. Verde, the Let Us Build Cully Park coalition and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation are the lead partners in the public/private partnership to transform the former landfill (and before that, a sand and gravel mine) into a developed, 25-acre city park. The park project now heads into the homestretch for fundraising, looking to raise a final $1 million.</p>
<p><strong>405 Portland families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by Thomas Cully Park.</strong></p>
<p>Data show that central-northeast Portland is second only to the area east of I-205 in terms of the greatest need for parks and natural areas in the city.</p>
<p>Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz made the funding announcement last night at the Portland Parks Foundation&rsquo;s 15th anniversary celebration. The funds to build Thomas Cully Park, located in a neighborhood acknowledged for a deficiency of parks and green spaces, come from System Development Charges (SDCs), and not General Fund tax dollars. SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) previously contributed over $1.5 million in SDCs towards the Thomas Cully Park project, bringing PP&amp;R&rsquo;s total contribution to over $4.5 million.</p>
<p>In addition to previously announced government investment, the partners in the Thomas Cully Park project are very grateful to House Speaker Tina Kotek and to Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith. Each of these elected leaders worked hard in recent budget sessions to secure $300,000 in state funding and $190,000 from the County towards the park construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled with all the collaboration evident in this project. The City is pleased to make this additional investment to help see the park in Cully become a reality,&rdquo; says Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;This project is innovative because it is being led by the community, and the City is proud to be a partner in realizing the dream. It is exciting to think of a new, large park in one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the state &ndash; in an area that is deficient in parks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buoyed by a $500,000 federal grant in April 2015, plus PP&amp;R funding, funding from other governments, foundation grants, and contributions from private citizens and companies, the effort to fund Thomas Cully Park has now raised more than $9.6 million. The park&rsquo;s fundraising target is $10.6 million. Last night the Portland Parks Foundation announced the start of a campaign to raise half a million dollars to cover 50% of the remaining gap, while Verde will continue to collaborate with partners to complete fundraising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reason we named our campaign Let Us Build Cully Park! -- no single organization or community or jurisdiction could build it alone, but together we can transform essentially a mountain of trash into a new asset for Cully and for Portland,&rdquo; says Alan Hip&oacute;lito, Verde&rsquo;s Executive Director. &ldquo;Today, we'd like to express our deepest appreciation to our partners Commissioner Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for this milestone investment, and to recognize PP&amp;R&rsquo;s many other, indispensable contributions to the project. Now, we&rsquo;d like to invite new partners to join us and the Portland Parks Foundation by making these final, critical contributions to build Cully Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cully neighborhood is recognized as the most diverse in Portland, perhaps in the state. Cully and parts of east Portland do not yet enjoy the same access to parks and green spaces as the rest of the city. 60% of residents in the future Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s service area are people belonging to traditionally underserved communities, and 45% are considered low income (annual household income of $40,000 or less).</p>
<p><strong>A final push to the finish</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal is within reach,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;But a sense of urgency remains. Though we certainly have cause to celebrate, we realize that we need a bit more private investment, community involvement and collaborative work to see the first phase of Thomas Cully Park completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 2012, Verde and PP&amp;R have involved over 600 community members in the project, including 191 youth. Community members have overseen the site&rsquo;s environmental assessment, designed the community garden, playground and Intertribal Gathering Garden, and developed safe routes for walking and biking to the park.</p>
<p>Thomas Cully Park is expected to include walking paths, an off-leash dog area, restrooms, a playground combining traditional play and nature play elements, overlooks, picnic areas, soccer field, habitat restoration and an Intertribal Gathering Garden, with entry provided by a rebuilt NE 72nd avenue. Early construction work during 2015-16 has included mass grading the site with nearly 70,000 cubic yards of clean fill material, habitat restoration on the site&rsquo;s north slope, completing the rebuild of NE 72nd avenue, and breaking ground on the Intertribal Gathering Garden. This unique feature will offer opportunities for honoring and educating about indigenous cultural values and ethics through holistic, culturally-significant garden design and maintenance.</p>

<p><em>PHOTO: Two boys play alongside a giant salmon sculpture, during the 2014 Salmon Festival. Photo from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.</em></p>
<p>The Salmon Celebration at Westmoreland Park will include a Native American blessing, a salmon bake demonstration, games, crafts, and inter-tribal activities. The event will be free and open to all. Please see this link for more info.</p>
<p>The Salmon Celebration coincides with the final 2016 Portland Sunday Parkways presented by Kaiser Permanente. The route includes Westmoreland Park as well a ride into the City of Milwaukie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a special annual celebration because we come together to appreciate the return of salmon in Crystal Springs Creek,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. The wild fish show us the lasting, positive results of the collaborative creek restoration efforts, and the festival allows us to unite as a community to appreciate both nature and each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The event is presented by the Crystal Spring Partnership, a group of community members, organizations, and city representatives who work in partnership with the Johnson Creek Watershed Council to make the Crystal Springs Watershed a vibrant, healthy place for people and wildlife. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Bureau of Environmental Services are proud partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What started as a culvert replacement project on Crystal Springs Creek evolved into a full-scale urban watershed restoration project,&rdquo; says Portland Environmental Services Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re reconnecting habitat for endangered fish and creating healthier waterways for all of us to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crystal Springs Partnership is using local knowledge and agency expertise to develop a national model for stewardship of urban watersheds. In particular, they are working toward ensuring that Crystal Springs Creek has healthy urban salmon runs, through community collaboration focused on education, advocacy, and restoration.</p>
<p>""The Crystal Springs Partnership is very pleased to join the City of Portland, local non-profits, businesses, and Tribal groups for the third annual Salmon Festival at Westmoreland Park"" said Mary Ann Schmidt, co-chair of the Crystal Springs Partnership. ""This is a unique opportunity to share the restored Crystal Springs Creek, and the return of salmon to this very urban creek in southeast Portland. Through this event, we continue our outreach to the community as well as provide fun, educational activities for all.""</p>
<p>The Salmon Celebration will:<br />&bull; Celebrate the restoration of Crystal Springs Creek and the return of wild salmon to the city!<br />&bull; Educate neighbors about human beings&rsquo; connection to natural systems and our dependence on a healthy environment<br />&bull; Share the history, culture and experiences of Native Americans, the first inhabitants of our lands<br />&bull; Cultivate an environment of intercultural learning<br />&bull; Help increase stewardship of Crystal Springs Creek through participation in the Crystal Springs Partnership</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we restore natural habitat, people benefit greatly as well,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Healthy natural environments help people have a better appreciation of nature. It is delightful to come together again to celebrate salmon in the city and to share the joy with our neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salmon Celebration Activities and Events:<br />&bull; Salmon bake demonstration (with samples!)<br />&bull; Storytelling for all ages<br />&bull; Fun and interactive inter-cultural activities<br />&bull; Learn about the watershed and how to get involved</p>

<p>The nonprofit Portland Parks Foundation (PPF) and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) are pleased to announce the return of Parke Diem: Portland&rsquo;s largest citywide volunteer event for the city&rsquo;s beloved parks. More than 1000 volunteers are joining forces at 58 community gardens, neighborhood parks and natural areas across Portland for Parke Diem&rsquo;s fourth year.</p>
<p>(PHOTO ABOVE: A 2015 <em>PARKE DIEM </em>EVENT AT COLUMBIA CHILDREN'S ARBORETUM)</p>
<p>Volunteers are welcome to sign up for Parke Diem events on October 14 and 15. Registration and information are available right now at parkediem.org.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation can only do the great work we do because of partnerships with the Foundation, with our corporate sponsors, and with our volunteers, all of whom contribute such valuable resources,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who will once again take part in several Parke Diem events. &ldquo;PP&amp;R&rsquo;s community gardens staff say that the volunteers at Parke Diem accomplish at least four months of work in just two days. I thank the Portland Parks Foundation for bringing so many volunteers together in the coordinated, two-day effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of its 15th anniversary celebration, the Portland Parks Foundation is awarding $11,228 in micro-grants to support Parke Diem projects this year. The Foundation has also launched a campaign aiming to raise a total of $15,000 to invest in parks. Installing new trail railings in Forest Park, renovating the display garden at Leach Botanical Garden and installing and winterizing garden beds in 57% of Portland&rsquo;s community gardens are just some of the exciting projects supported by PPF funds.<br /><br />&ldquo;Portlanders benefit so much from their parks, and Parke Diem is a great way to give back,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Foundation Executive Director Jeff Anderson. &ldquo;We're also pleased to be able to give micro-grants to support Parke Diem&rsquo;s grass-roots projects--they may be small compared to the $11 million of investments we&rsquo;ve made in parks and park programs since 2001, but the community volunteers make a little go a long way.""<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neighbors helping neighbors toward our shared goal of Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Parke Diem is an exciting way to make a real difference in the quality of life in our city,&rdquo; We thank our friends at the Portland Parks Foundation for leading the charge.&rdquo;<br />Parke Diem is led by a network of community volunteers and park &ldquo;friends&rdquo; groups that help craft the projects and mobilize the 1,000 volunteers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 150 volunteers at Hoyt Arboretum have a tremendous impact on the health of the collection, says Hoyt Volunteer and Education Coordinator Lorraine Brooks. &ldquo;Their 600 collective hours of work during Parke Diem are used to pull invasive plants, repot 400+ tree seedlings and prepare the arboretum for winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parke Diem is led by the Portland Parks Foundation, an independent, nonprofit organization formed in 2001 to bring resources for the long-term stewardship of Portland's parks and park programs. The Foundation works hand in hand with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and is committed to building collaborations and investments that strengthen Portland's parks.</p>

<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=588446"" alt=""Do not enter water sign"" width=""350"" height=""525"" />Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces that <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=209"">Kelley Point Park</a> is again open today after a temporary closure. PP&amp;R has installed new signs at the park (N Marine Drive and Lombard Street, at the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers) on the heels of two recent drownings in less than two weeks. Portland Fire &amp; Rescue (PFR) supported the temporary closure, which began Monday, August 22, 2016, which allowed PP&amp;R to install the signs, and to do outreach with partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want neighbors to know that yes, Kelley Point Park is open again, but also that the area is hazardous and nobody should wade or swim there,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We hope the community will help spread the word and that this will be a safe and enjoyable Labor Day weekend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation installed additional and larger <em>&ldquo;Do not enter water&rdquo; </em>signs at Kelley Point Park. The nearly three dozen signs have a swimming icon surrounded by the familiar red circle and line, as well as messaging in English and in 14 other languages warning visitors to say out of the water.</p>
<p>There are several factors which make swimming off Kelley Point Park much different &ndash; and more dangerous &ndash; than swimming in a lake, for instance, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful currents as two unpredictable and powerful rivers come together</li>
<li>An uneven bank</li>
<li>Unknown underwater obstructions</li>
<li>A land shelf with an abrupt and deep drop-off and notably,</li>
<li>Locations where people&rsquo;s feet are suddenly getting caught in sticky mud in deeper water</li>
</ul>
<p>These, plus ever-changing environmental conditions are some of the major factors that make swimming or wading off of Kelley Point Park so risky, and so life-threatening. The natural beauty of the area may belie these hazards, and PP&amp;R asks for the community&rsquo;s help get the word out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make sure the danger of swimming off Kelley Point Park is clear to all park visitors,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We know the temporary closure was an inconvenience for some folks, but we felt it was necessary.&nbsp; With the park open once again, we hope visitors to Kelley Point will enjoy the trails and other on-shore activities with an eye on safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abbat&eacute; and Portland Fire &amp; Rescue officials also stressed that there is only so much that signs can do. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation estimates that there is roughly one mile of shoreline at Kelley Point Park, and signs at every water entry point are not feasible.</p>
<p>Portland Fire &amp; Rescue works diligently to rescue swimmers in trouble, but says prevention and awareness are the most effective tools to keep people out of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our abilities to rescue swimmers in the situations such as we encountered this month are very limited,&rdquo; says PF&amp;R Chief Mike Myers. &ldquo;We need to save people before they even get in the water, and we must rely on education, and the community understanding what they face when it comes to nature, to bolster our efforts. We don&rsquo;t want to see any more tragedies like these.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Other measures possible</strong></p>
<p>At this time, the bureau has determined that the powerful rivers and ever-changing conditions at Kelley Point Park are too unpredictable to be considered safe for swimming or wading- until more analysis is complete and possibly other precautions established. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has begun asking websites and partners which counted Kelley Point Park as a swimming destination to remove the park from their listings. PP&amp;R will consider longer-term measures in addition to the increased and larger signage now in place. The bureau may consider factors including scientific data on the depth and topography, current, and/or other conditions of the area off Kelley Point Park in order to inform any future decisions involving swimming.</p>

<p><strong>National Eating Disorders Association walk on Sept 17, 2016</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Citywide Teen Services Team are proud to be partnering with the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) for the 2016 NEDA Walk.</p>
<p><strong>What: Portland&rsquo;s National Eating Disorders Walk</strong><br /><strong>Where: Peninsula Park, 700 N Rosa Parks Way</strong><br /><strong>When: Saturday, September 17, 2016</strong><br /><strong>Why: Help PP&amp;R and NEDA support those on the path to recovery!</strong><br /><strong>On social media: #WHYINEDAWALK</strong></p>
<p>The Portland NEDA walk aims to raise both awareness and funds around helping people impacted by eating disorders. National data show that many the people who struggle with the potentially life-threatening conditions are young people.</p>
<p>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 95% of people afflicted by eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and 25.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a retired Registered Nurse, health remains one of my top priorities,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Eating disorders impact people from all walks of life, as well as their loved ones. I hope for a strong showing by neighbors to help PP&amp;R and NEDA support those on the path to recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our mission is &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;&rdquo;, notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We believe that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is in a unique position to connect youth with opportunities to build confidence and self-esteem. We know how very important community, recreation and education are to the growth and health of young people. We are proud to help NEDA build communities of compassionate advocates.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Activities in place now; community celebration set for Thursday, September 15</strong></p>
<p>Grubbin&rsquo;, a food cart pod and arts endeavor created by Portland&rsquo;s Jamal Gardner, is now active at Ankeny Square in the North Park Blocks (SW Ankeny and W Burnside). Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) chose Gardner&rsquo;s proposal out of 15 visionary and competitive ideas to create a welcoming presence at the previously under-utilized park space, and to help enhance the entire area.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=587776"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""640"" /></p>
<p>A community gathering celebrating the area&rsquo;s revitalization is set for Thursday, September 15, from 12pm-1pm. Mayor Charlie Hales, Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, and other city and community leaders will be there; everyone is welcome to attend.</p>
<p>WHAT: Celebrate the revitalization of Ankeny Square in the North Park Blocks!<br />WHERE: Ankeny Square, SW Ankeny and W Burnside<br />WHEN: Thursday, September 15, 2016; 12pm-1pm.<br />Free and open to everyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland has world-class neighborhoods because of the vibrant activity we infuse in them &mdash; we call it &lsquo;placemaking&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s what makes our city so special,&rdquo; says Portland Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;This centrally located square is a tremendous example of a successful public-private partnership creating a perfect place for neighbors and visitors to experience Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grubbin&rsquo; offers daily food carts and regular arts and music offerings at Ankeny Square at the North Park Blocks. The idea for more cool happenings at the square came from neighbors and businesses surrounding the park, and remains fully supported by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Across the PP&amp;R system, programmed activities are found to create a vibrant, engaging, and positive environment for parks and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to see a young entrepreneur&rsquo;s vision come to life, and even better when it dovetails with the needs of our City and parks system,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;When there are desirable, family-friendly activities happening in a park, our experience has clearly shown that the surrounding neighborhood benefits. I look forward to the community celebration around Ankeny Square&rsquo;s renewal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ankeny Square is located between West Burnside and SW Ankeny, and between SW 8th Ave and SW Park Ave on the edge of the Pearl District in downtown Portland. Ankeny Square sits at the southern end of Portland's historic North Park Blocks, and has long been an integral part of downtown life. One of the city&rsquo;s oldest public spaces, the North Park Blocks were dedicated to the City by Captain John Couch in 1869. Ankeny Square at the North Park Blocks now has a BIKETOWN-Portland Bike Share station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grubbin&rsquo; is an exciting new way to activate a historic park site, which is becoming increasingly an important consideration with our parks,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The City has enhanced much of the infrastructure at the Ankeny Square, and Jamal has brought in activities that people want to stop by and enjoy. It&rsquo;s a win-win for the benefit of all Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of Grubbin&rsquo; came from my desire to create a one-stop shop for family-friendly, multicultural food and art,&rdquo; says Gardner. &ldquo;The visitor experience is enhanced by bike parking on site; delicious food, music and art. This is a challenging endeavor, but one I&rsquo;m delighted to undertake. It&rsquo;s my hope this will prove to be a mutually beneficial relationship between Grubbin&rsquo; and our clients, neighbors and businesses, and the City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation continues to work on enhancing the Ankeny Square environment via carpentry painting, electrical and mechanical work. Fencing is expected to be up as work dictates to allow crews to clean, paint, and further spruce up the historic space.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soo&rsquo;s range of experience, her passion for our bureau's mission, and her belief in the power of art and culture will be tremendous assets,&rdquo; says Eileen Argentina, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Services Manager. &ldquo;Her efforts will help to improve and enrich people&rsquo;s lives, and contribute to a better and more inclusive Portland.""</p>
<p>Arts and culture play a vital role in Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s mission. The bureau has four arts facilities, arts programming in several urban parks, and around 250 free annual events in the wildly popular Summer Free For All series.</p>

<p>Pak has dedicated her entire professional life to the nonprofit arts. Prior to moving to Portland, she served in high-ranking positions at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), a large-scale performing arts and cinema center. She also worked at New York&rsquo;s French Institute Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise in marketing and communications, served with the Museum of Fine Arts in film programming in Boston, and at the Boston Center for the Arts in theater management. Pak grew up in northern Virginia; spent her young adulthood in New York and Boston; and moved to Portland in 2014 - where she says she has never felt more at home.</p>
<p>Pak lives in southwest Portland with her husband (an artist) and daughter. They enjoy hiking as a family and spend a lot of time at the nearby Gabriel Park and Southwest Community Center.</p>

2016,585330,Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announces funding for Columbia Children’s Arboretum,2,,2016-08-08 16:18:44 UTC,2016-08-01 15:57:00 UTC,A,"Accessibility improvements to assist neighbors, other future improvements possible","<p><strong><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=585357"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /><br /><br />POSTED AUGUST 1, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility improvements to assist neighbors, other future improvements possible</strong></p>
<p>Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz has designated more than $1.1 million towards improvements at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?propertyid=15&amp;action=ViewPark"">Columbia Children&rsquo;s Arboretum</a>. The funding comes not from tax dollars, but from construction development funds called &ldquo;SDCs&rdquo; or System Development Charges. The investment will allow PP&amp;R to increase circulation and access at the Arboretum&mdash;including the development of a paved multi-use trail, vital for more people to be able to get around the unique northeast Portland destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Columbia Children&rsquo;s Arboretum is a unique park with an environmental education legacy dating to the 1960s,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We also note that the Columbia Children&rsquo;s Arboretum is a part of town where there is not as much access to parks and green spaces as there is in the rest of Portland. Therefore, it is vital we invest in this gem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This property is one of only two arboretums in the entire PP&amp;R system,&rdquo; says Maryhelen Kincaid of the Friends of Columbia Children&rsquo;s Arboretum. &ldquo;And we recognize its unique footprint and value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the $1.135M in funding dedicated by Commissioner Fritz the unique arboretum will be accessible to people with strollers and mobility devices. PP&amp;R will soon begin discussing the upgrades with the community, and plans to finalize the scope of the project in the spring 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City. Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year. PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty. PP&amp;R has additional and unfunded growth needs of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Funding for the improvements at the Columbia Children&rsquo;s Arboretum come not from General Fund Tax dollars, but from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (SDCs). These are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Park SDCs are restricted by law and can only be used to expand capacity (rather than to maintain or repair existing park facilities). SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.</p>
<p>However, SDCs are unfortunately insufficient to fully address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park.&nbsp;That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area&ldquo;, adds Commissioner Fritz.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>POSTED JULY 29, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation tips for a safe summer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay hydrated. Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day - 8 oz. each, and drink more if you are working, playing or exercising.</li>
<li>Sleep well. Rest is important to the daily recovery of muscles and your body and brain function.</li>
<li>Choose food wisely. A sugar rush is usually followed by sugar burnout, about 30 minutes later. Instead, choose whole food proteins, healthy fats and natural sources of carbohydrates. If it wasn&rsquo;t around a thousand years ago or is made by man (and not nature), chances are you don&rsquo;t need it.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t burn! Remember to pack and USE sunscreen. Apply it frequently and reapply after swimming.</li>
<li>Cooling centers - &nbsp;people in need of heat relief are encouraged to visit 211info.org or to call 211 for the locations of cooling centers in your area. Other places to get out of the heat include <a href=""/parks/39839"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Community Centers</a>, libraries, shopping malls, and nonprofit organizations.</li>
<li>Our H20 is NOT too low. The Portland Water Bureau assures us that our City&rsquo;s current water use is normal for this time of year. The Bull Run reservoirs have plenty of water to meet the higher summer demand that comes with hot weather. Anyone with questions can call the Portland Water Bureau Water Line at 503-823-7525.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>POOLS</strong></h2>
<p>Keep cool in a PP&amp;R pool, offering open play swims, water exercise classes, junior lifeguard training, junior swim training, summer swim teams, and special events.&nbsp;A list of pools and schedules is available at <a href=""/parks/38284"">portlandoregon.gov/parks/pools.</a></p>
<h2><strong>SPLASH PADS and FOUNTAINS</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Splash pads and fountains around the city are open to help you stay cool!</strong> Cool off through the end of September. Splash pad hours are 11 am to 9 pm; fountain hours mirror park hours. What&rsquo;s the difference? Fountains have chlorination and recirculate water; while water in splash pads drains away &ndash; like running through the sprinklers.Our list is also available online at <a href=""/parks/splash"">portlandoregon.gov/parks/splash</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bureau issues first Annual Report for the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond</strong></p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=585184"" alt="""" width=""250"" height=""187.5"" /></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has begun work on 26 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a> projects, and has completed the first Bond project with the <a href=""/parks/article/584529"">reopening of Grant Pool</a>. The Bureau presented these and other Bond updates to City Council on Thursday, July 28, 2016, issuing the first <a href=""/parks/71311"">Annual Report</a> for the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond.</p>
<p><em><strong>Photo:</strong> The recently completed Parks Replacement Bond project at Grant Pool, which reopened July 25, 2016. Some of Grant Pool&rsquo;s old inner workings dated from the 1920s before the Bond allowed for much-needed upgrades.</em></p>
<p>The Annual Report shows that design work is underway or complete on 26 of the 33 Parks Replacement Bond projects, one project (Grant Pool) is already complete, and 16 projects are proceeding ahead of schedule.</p>
<p class=""Pa0""><strong>The Bond has been a success in its first year based on stated goals to</strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep projects on or ahead of schedule.</li>
<li>Separate bond fund tracking from other PP&amp;R funds.</li>
<li>Establish effective tracking systems.</li>
<li>Involve the public and create and utilize transparent processes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Parks Replacement Bond projects include</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Playgrounds currently closed, at risk of closure, or deficient,&nbsp;such as Couch, Creston, Kenton, Lents, Lynchview, the North Park Blocks, and Ventura Parks.</li>
<li>Bridge and trail repairs in Forest Park and along the Springwater Corridor Trail.</li>
<li>Repairs at PP&amp;R pools, including Matt Dishman, and Peninsula (Grant Pool was the first Bond project to be completed, it reopened on July 25, 2016).</li>
<li>Restrooms, roofs, other deficient structures and equipment at various PP&amp;R sites.</li>
<li>Repairing Pioneer Courthouse Square&rsquo;s failing structures, leaks, cracks.</li>
<li>Removing barriers to accessibility for people experiencing disabilities, at multiple locations.</li>
<li>Addressing worker safety and efficiency at PP&amp;R maintenance buildings.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;It is crucial to have the Parks Replacement Bond managed effectively, as it is addressing some of the most pressing needs across the PP&amp;R system,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I am particularly happy to report that 32% of the Bond&rsquo;s professional services contracts and 21% of construction contracts have gone to minorities, women, and/or emerging small businesses. We will continue to work alongside the community in the implementation of this bond and look forward to further reports on how projects are progressing&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November 2014, 74 percent of Portland voters elected to implement the Parks Replacement Bond &ndash; the highest percentage ever of votes for a parks-related ballot measure. The Bond calls for up to $68 million in major repair projects, distributed among two project lists (the current list is for the 33 existing projects totaling $48M; the second Bond project list will be developed this autumn).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to Portlanders for not only supporting the Bond but also helping shape the projects,&ldquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The community&rsquo;s input results in a better product.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Annual Report</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are currently 33 Bond projects: 18 ahead of schedule, 12 on schedule, three behind schedule</li>
<li>26 of the 33 Bond projects are now underway, in either design or construction; the remaining seven will begin design work in 2016-17</li>
<li>21 projects will break ground in 2016-17</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The Bond&rsquo;s $68 million in funding will help address some of the most crucial needs of the Parks system,&rdquo; added Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;But unfortunately, it is not enough to close the gap on all of our major maintenance needs. We will continue to look for ways to leverage bond funds with outside grants and private fundraising efforts. And I will continue to look for ways to address the needs of our parks system.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which takes aim at a $248M funding gap for major maintenance needs over the next ten years. Further, PP&amp;R anticipates $472M in unfunded <em>growth</em> needs during that period. That adds up to a $720M funding gap over the next decade, which Commissioner Fritz will continue to work with City Council to address. Currently, 20% of people living in Portland do NOT have access to a park or natural area within a 15 minute walk, and the bureau is working hard to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;.</p>

Without these long-needed repairs, PP&amp;R had been faced with likely not opening Grant Pool for the entire 2016 summer.</p>
<p>Thanks to overwhelming voter support of the <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, PP&amp;R was able to complete the project at Grant Pool, just the first of many other Bond projects citywide. Parks Replacement Bond projects are repairing some of the most critical components of the City&rsquo;s park system.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class=""content-left"" style=""font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 13.2px; ; line-height: 17.16px;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=584526"" alt="""" width=""40%"" /></p>
<p>Much of Grant Pool&rsquo;s crumbling inner workings had been unchanged since the 1920s. The Bond project replaced early 20<sup>th</sup> century infrastructure, including plumbing, pumps, motors, pipes, strainer baskets, chemical controllers, sanitation systems, pool gutters, deck drains, and filters. The work included ADA accessibility improvements including the installation of two new pool lifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to see Grant Pool open earlier than anticipated, and in time for much of this summer,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The pool is a treasured asset for the community, and that is why we prioritized it as the first Parks Bond project to be completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pool will undergo a few more repairs (to the pool floor and concrete decking) after it closes for the season (not until Friday, September 23). However, right now all critical maintenance and safety repairs are completed, and the pool is open again - while kids are still out of school on summer vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grant Pool schedule can be found on PP&amp;R&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/article/579362"">website</a> or by calling (503) 823-3674. Several swim lesson sessions will be held in August and September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the Bond allowed us to undertake these urgent repairs, our staff did the best they could to keep the pool running, season after season,&rdquo; adds PP&amp;R Director Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;But the past solution of patchwork repairs to ancient, leaky equipment was simply no longer viable. This Bond project ensures that future summer seasons will not be impacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There will be a grand reopening celebration on a yet-to-be-determined August date; once it is decided, the Bureau will notify neighbors and key stakeholders, including media.</p>
<p><strong>About the Parks Replacement Bond</strong></p>
<p>The Parks Replacement Bond was passed with the support of over 74% of voters in November 2014. Its primary focus is on repair and replacement of the most critical needs in the parks system. The total bond is for $68 million, and work has begun on the first list of 33 Bond projects citywide.</p>

For young soccer players, teams provide community and valuable social support, encouraging positive choices during the transition to a new life. The soccer tournament itself is a celebration of turning challenges into opportunities, and of building unity.</p>

<p><strong>All results from Charles Jordan Community Center test far below actionable levels</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is continuing testing that began in June 2016 at several of our properties as a voluntary precautionary measure. PP&amp;R is adhering to the guidance put forward by Oregon Health Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency that lead in drinking water at schools and day cares should not exceed 20 parts per billion (ppb).</p>
<p><strong>NEXT SITES FOR TESTING</strong></p>
<p>Working with our partners at Portland Water Bureau, PP&amp;R is moving forward with testing at all PP&amp;R facilities that host preschools, regardless of date of construction. This will total more than 20 sites. Because of the high number of samples to be collected at each facility, testing will likely take most of the summer to complete. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s focus continues to be on any likely prolonged drinking water access by children, as this testing moves forward.</p>
<p>Here is the full list of sites that will be tested this summer:</p>

<p>On Monday, July 18, 2016, PP&amp;R received results from testing at our Charles Jordan Community Center; results are posted <a href=""/omf/article/584253"">here</a>. All water tested below the threshold of 20 parts per billion (ppb).</p>
<p>Consistent with guidance from the Portland Water Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency, samples were taken from fixtures commonly used for drinking or cooking.</p>
<p><strong>ALL TEST RESULTS AVAILABLE ONLINE</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R will continue communicating about the test results directly to site patrons, and results will be posted on this website for all Portlanders to see: <a href=""/LeadInfo"">portlandoregon.gov/LeadInfo</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working to ensure there are no ongoing issues with lead in drinking water at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation facilities,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And that any that we encounter are immediately addressed to protect public health, and then fully remediated. While test results to this point have been encouraging, overall, we strive to provide &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multnomah County health authorities say they have conducted more than 15,000 blood tests over the last three years on children and teens. The County says that of those 15-thousand-plus tests, elevated blood lead levels were found in 190 of those people. No cases were traced to lead in drinking water from any source.&nbsp;</p>

2016,583022,Portland Parks & Recreation completes preliminary review of Multnomah Arts Center lead in water testing history,2,,2016-09-12 17:16:43 UTC,2016-07-07 17:38:00 UTC,A,"Bureau to continue to review materials, documentation, and chronology","<p><strong>POSTED JUNE 7, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><em><strong>Bureau to continue to review materials, documentation, and chronology</strong></em></p>
<p>On June 20, 2016, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) sent out a water quality testing <a href=""/parks/article/581176"">update</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bureau now has preliminary findings (as of July 5, 2016) on the history of testing for lead in water and measures previously taken at the Multnomah Arts Center (MAC). That information is available <a href=""/omf/article/582892"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The review reveals that PP&amp;R management has not historically had in place any policy, protocol or training around drinking water testing. PP&amp;R management did not have any process nor policy in place dictating when to conduct tests, what to do with results, when to escalate environmental and safety test results exceeding guidelines up the chain-of-command nor to the Safety Officer. PP&amp;R management has not had in place any protocols on when or how to communicate with the community about any results.</p>
<p>There is no federal, state or local regulation requiring water testing for parks facilities.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R management accepts the responsibility to create effective protocols and policies around Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) risks.&nbsp; The Bureau&rsquo;s review continues, and Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute; are considering what steps the Bureau will implement going forward.</p>
<p>Recommendations for the PP&amp;R Director to consider include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) Management System, including hiring staff dedicated to and with expertise in this work. In the near-term, procure consultant services to immediately supplement staff for starting up a water quality testing program.</li>
<li>Training of staff around HSE issues and protocols.</li>
<li>Process improvements such as Shop Lead sign-offs on some Work Orders and spot checks, especially of safety-related work.</li>
<li>Better tracking systems for the Minor Improvement Project (MIP) and Capital Improvement Project (CIP) Work Flows.</li>
<li>Management should work with staff to determine appropriate maintenance staffing levels for MAC and other facilities.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;It is my responsibility to work with management and staff to make sure that the needed Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) protocols are in place across our parks system,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also my job to advocate for the needed resources. I support our frontline staff who have been continuously committed to doing their best even when resources have been constrained. In the MAC situation, management did not previously provide clear protocols and training&mdash;but we are doing it now. As I mentioned on June 20, this summer our priority is to test all PP&amp;R sites where preschools are located. We will share further results when we have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will continue to review materials, documentation, and chronology and add to the report as needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are committed to continuing our transparency to the public on these issues,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I will work with Director Abbat&eacute; to move forward on long-term plans for taking care of our aging parks system, with health and safety as the top priorities.&rdquo;</p>

2016,582397,Portland Parks & Recreation Receives Corporate Support for Summer Free For All Program,2,,2016-07-08 00:08:53 UTC,2016-06-30 19:32:00 UTC,A,"Summer Free For All kicks off with check presentations from Comcast, Bank of America, other valued sponsors and helps bring Portland families free summer movies, concerts and more !","<p><strong><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=582470"" alt="""" width=""100%"" />POSTED JUNE&nbsp;30, 2016</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong>Summer Free For All kicks off with check presentations from Comcast, Bank of America, other valued sponsors and helps bring Portland families free summer movies, concerts and more!&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) celebrated Comcast and Bank of America&rsquo;s generous philanthropic support of the <a href=""/parks/61921"">Summer Free For All</a> (SFFA) program during a check presentation on June 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marc Farrar of Comcast, which became the 2016 SFFA Title Sponsor after many years of continued support, presented a $40,000 check at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Dawson Park, and Bank of America&rsquo;s Senior Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility, Monique Barton, presented a check for $26,000. Bank of America is now proudly in its third year of support for the SFFA program. Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbate and Portland Parks Foundation Director Jeff Anderson were all on hand during the celebration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">These sponsors, as well as the continued support of hundreds of other individuals and companies, provide PP&amp;R with the financial backing necessary to keep the program free and expand access to these wildly popular summer events. Summer Free For All continues to bring the best of culturally relevant movies, music and recreation programs to Portland neighborhoods.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">Free lunches are available through Portland Parks &amp; Recreation at 27 <a href=""/parks/69873"">Summer Playgrounds &amp; Lunch</a> sites, and are key to helping close the summer meal gap for low and moderate income school-age children. In Multnomah County alone, nearly 18 percent of families live in poverty and are at risk for food insecurity, poor nutrition and obesity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">""More than half of Portland&rsquo;s school children qualify for free or reduced priced lunches,&rdquo; notes Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;So the Summer Free For All makes a real impact on families &ndash; thanks to our partners, PP&amp;R will serve more than 100,000 lunches at various sites this summer. Our sponsors&rsquo; commitment to the Summer Free For All title sponsorship shows their passion for making our community better and helps deliver dozens of free outdoor movies, concerts, and playground lunch programs to Portlanders.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">&ldquo;Comcast is proud to be the title sponsor of the Summer Free For All program,&rdquo; said Marc Farrar, vice-president of external affairs for Comcast Oregon and Southwest Washington.&#8239; &ldquo;We are pleased to invest in opportunities that enable families to enjoy special programming in Portland&rsquo;s parks and playgrounds all summer long.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">The uniqueness of the Summer Free For All program stems from its broad base of community support. This year, hundreds of donors &mdash; local businesses, community groups, neighborhood associations and individuals &mdash; will give generously to a program that is tailored to offer the best of entertainment comprised of both local and regional talent at Portland&rsquo;s parks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">In addition to free meals, the Summer Playgrounds &amp; Lunch program features sports, games, crafts and family activities, including PP&amp;R&rsquo;s mobile rock climbing wall. Aside from nearly 30 <a href=""/parks/69873"">Summer Playgrounds &amp; Lunch</a> sites, this year&rsquo;s SFFA includes 55 <a href=""/parks/69555"">Concerts in the Park</a>, 41 <a href=""/parks/69554"">Movies in the Park</a>, <a href=""/parks/article/489147"">Free Swim sessions</a> at all of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s indoor and outdoor pools, the Washington Park Summer Festival and a new Children&rsquo;s Concert Series at Unthank Park. In neighborhoods without parks, there are 20 <a href=""/parks/69873"">Mobile Playground sites</a> (marked with a wheel icon) that bring lunch, recreation and health education where the opportunity is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">&ldquo;Our <a href=""/parks/57733"">mission</a> is &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Summer Free For All is a wonderful way many people first engage with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation programs. Partners like Comcast, Bank of America, the Portland Parks Foundation and local school districts help make these connections possible by continuing to invest in Summer Free For All. This support leads to a lifetime of healthier, happier people of all ages, as well as a united community.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ongoing commitment to the Summer Free For All program is important to us since it&rsquo;s addressing the basic needs of local kids and families,&rdquo; said Monique Barton, Bank of America&rsquo;s Senior Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility. &ldquo;Coming together as a community to fight hunger and effectively address summer food insecurity among school-age children is a very worthy cause, and one we are proud to be a part of.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">Summer Free For All schedules are posted on the <a href=""/parks/61921"">PP&amp;R website</a>. A new addition this year in order to better serve Portland&rsquo;s diverse community, PP&amp;R is offering the Summer Free For All schedule in nine different languages: Arabic, Burmese, English, simplified Chinese, Nepalese, Russian, Spanish, Somalian and Vietnamese.&nbsp;</p>

2016,581176,Portland Parks & Recreation water quality testing update,2,,2016-06-28 16:41:19 UTC,2016-06-20 19:30:00 UTC,A,"On Sunday, June 5, Portland Parks & Recreation sent out a press release regarding voluntary testing of water at some of its facilities as well as information on past elevated lead results at one facility, Multnomah Arts Center (MAC).","<p><strong>POSTED JUNE 20, 2016</strong><br /><br />(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>On Sunday, June 5, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sent out a <a href=""/parks/article/579265"">press release</a> regarding voluntary testing of water at some of its facilities as well as information on past elevated lead results at one facility, Multnomah Arts Center (MAC).</p>
<p>At that time PP&amp;R began both precautionary measures and a testing process for priority sites. Please note that for testing results, PP&amp;R is adhering the guidance put forward by <a href=""http://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyEnvironments/HealthyNeighborhoods/LeadPoisoning/ChildCareSchools/Documents/schools-lead-in-drinking-water.pdf"">Oregon Health Authority</a> and the <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-09/documents/toolkit_leadschools_guide_3ts_leadschools.pdf"">Environmental Protection Agency</a> that lead in drinking water at schools and day cares should not exceed 20 parts per billion (ppb). PP&amp;R will fix any plumbing fixture used for drinking and/or cooking that tests over the 20 parts per billion threshold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following update shows that of 180 specific samples taken, 163 (or about 91%) came back with levels lower that 20 parts per billion. 17 of the 180 samples came back with levels higher than 20ppb.</p>
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R began testing at three priority sites during the week of June 6, 2016 (Fulton Community Center, Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, and MAC). PP&amp;R had already implemented precautionary measures at these sites: although there were no previous test results for Fulton and Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, a precautionary flushing protocol was implemented at all water fixtures. At MAC, all fixtures were marked &ldquo;Do not drink&rdquo; and PP&amp;R provided drinking water because previously elevated lead levels were detected at this site.</li>
<li>With precautionary measures already in place, on Tuesday, June 14, PP&amp;R received the water quality test results as follows:</li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Fulton Community Center</span></strong><strong>: </strong>None of the 12 samples taken exceeded 20ppb for lead.&nbsp; One drinking fountain was not sampled because it was out-of-commission at the time of sampling.&nbsp; PP&amp;R will have it tested as soon as possible after repairs are complete.
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R is releasing Fulton from the flushing requirement.</li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Children&rsquo;s Museum</span></strong><strong>: </strong>Of 76 samples taken, 5 exceeded 20ppb lead &ndash; four sinks and one drinking fountain.&nbsp; Those sink faucets which exceed 20ppb lead are all now signed &ldquo;do not drink&rdquo;.&nbsp; The one drinking fountain (located in a staff area) which exceeded 20ppb had already previously been turned off.
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R is releasing Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum from the flushing requirement where test results did not exceed 20ppb</li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Multnomah Arts Center (MAC)</span></strong><strong>: </strong>Of 75 samples taken, 11 exceeded 20ppb lead.&nbsp; Those fixtures which exceeded 20ppb were already signed &ldquo;do not drink&rdquo; or were shut off entirely to the public since June 4. The highest reading at MAC registered 447 ppb, at a fixture located in a storage area, and has not been in use recently. Bottled water is still being provided until PP&amp;R can assure full mitigation and retesting.
<ul>
<li>One brand-new drinking fountain with confirmed results of well below 20 ppb has been reopened for public use at MAC.</li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MAC Cottages</span></strong><strong>: </strong>The Cottages at MAC that are adjacent to the facility have a separate water system. Occupancy for the cottages includes preschool, arts studios, and multipurpose office space. The cottages at MAC were considered at low risk. The June 14 results show that only one sink (in a men&rsquo;s bathroom) in these cottages showed elevated levels of lead. That sink has now been marked &ldquo;do not drink.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upon reviewing operational and engineering data during the week of June 6<sup>th</sup>, 2016, PP&amp;R also decided to add the Mt. Tabor Annex to the top priority sites due to the fact that it hosts a preschool, even though it does not fit the 1970-1985 high-risk building age criteria. It was acquired by PP&amp;R in the 80&rsquo;s, and it is likely that some facility modifications took place at that time which may have included plumbing work.&nbsp; The Mt. Tabor Annex was tested for lead on the week of June 13, 2016, and had the precautionary measure of water fountains taken out of service and drinking water provided during the testing phase.</li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Mt. Tabor Annex:</span></strong> Of 17 samples taken, 1 shows 20ppb lead.&nbsp; This was a drinking fountain on the first floor which had already been turned off.&nbsp; Preschool staff indicated that this fountain had not been frequently used.
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R is releasing all other Mt. Tabor Annex fixtures for use</li>
<li>Mt. Tabor Annex was tested by a Certified Industrial Hygienist due to volume and need for expediency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recent test results completed by the Portland Water Bureau for Fulton Community Center, Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum and Multnomah Arts Center, and Mt. Tabor Annex are available at this site: <a href=""/bibs/LeadInfo"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/bibs/LeadInfo</a></p>
<p>The next step is for an independent Certified Industrial Hygienist to review results and recommend next steps to remedy any fixture over the 20 parts per billion threshold. PP&amp;R will post more information on review results and recommendations when they are available.</p>
<p>Additional and ongoing updates are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PP&amp;R is still reviewing information regarding steps that were taken at Multnomah Arts Center between 2011 and now. We will release any new information on that matter when available. <br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>After a review of records, as of June 17, 2016, the bureau has determined that there have been a small number of PP&amp;R sites previously tested over the past several decades. No sites, beside the previously reported Multnomah Arts Center, had elevated lead test results prior to June 2016.</li>
<li>PP&amp;R has had some customer-requested testing at sinks or fountains at the following facilities: Community Music Center (2001), Pittock Mansion (2005), Buckman Field (office &amp; fieldhouse in 2010), and Mount Tabor Yard (2000 and 2016). All showed lead levels below EPA guidelines.</li>
<li>PP&amp;R found results from an additional test (2003) of a sink at the Multnomah Arts Center &ldquo;cottages&rdquo; located at an adjacent address that confirmed no elevated levels. The occupancy of the cottages includes preschool, arts studios, and multipurpose office space.</li>
<li>PP&amp;R discovered additional previous testing at Multnomah Art Center from 1987 that showed water &ldquo;meets federal standards for drinking water.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Results from previously tested sites (prior to June 2016) are available for review <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/owo1tqw5stcf77j/All%20prior%20to%20June%202016%20PP%26R%20PWB%20Test%20Results.pdf?dl=0"">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We strive to provide &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will continue to work with technical experts and our Commissioner-in-charge to develop protocols for testing of our facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On June 8, 2016, the Oregon Department of Education and the Oregon Health Authority began recommending that all schools, including preschools and day cares, test for lead over the summer. Therefore, the next priority list PP&amp;R will create will include sites where all preschools are located (regardless of age of the building or plumbing).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have taken every step necessary to protect public health,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, a retired Registered Nurse. &ldquo;We will continue to work to fix problems efficiently, and to provide information to our community as more details become available&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Portland Pickles&rsquo; partnership results in stadium improvements which all Portlanders can enjoy.</strong><em><br />Public/private partnership makes Walker Stadium in Lents Park better than new</em></p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><em>Huge community benefit</em></li>
<li><em>Portland Pickles Opening Day is today, Friday, June 10</em></li>
<li><em>Approx 30 home games a year, stadium available for community use the rest of the time</em></li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=580009"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>(above: the renovated Walker Stadium at PP&amp;R's Lents Park in southeast Portland)</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation announces that renovations to Walker Stadium, located in Lents Park (SE 92<sup>nd</sup> and Holgate), are complete, and the field is ready for the Portland Pickles Opening Day (Friday, June 10, 2016).&nbsp; The Walker Stadium renovations were made possible by a public-private partnership between the Pickles (Portland&rsquo;s new college wood-bat team, and part of the Great West League), Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and the Portland Development Commission (PDC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome the improvements to Walker Stadium, which will be open for community recreational use during most of the year,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we wish the Pickles good luck in their inaugural season.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wonderful to have baseball back in the Rose City after five years away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pickles will play 33 home games this year, and are owned and operated by Rose City Baseball, LLC, under the direction of team owners Bill Stewart and Ken Wilson - the latter also acting as Team President and CEO.&nbsp; The Pickles pay rent to the City, clean the stadium, and provide security during games. Outside of the 30 Great West League baseball games annually, the freshly renovated stadium will be available for play by recreational players or anyone else to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were proud to work with both the City and local businesses to help make this happen,&rdquo; says Stewart.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s great that the Pickles and the City of Portland can both be on the same team.&nbsp; Families will be able to enjoy the stadium for delightful summer evenings of baseball, but importantly, it will be open for community use &ndash; recreational leagues for kids and adults &ndash; for much of the year.&nbsp; It makes me proud to have a part in making that possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Walker Stadium has more than 1000 seats, plus group event areas.&nbsp; The stadium in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park was constructed in 1956, and is located within easy reach of mass transit and major freeways.&nbsp; The updated Walker Stadium caters to fans&rsquo; enjoyment of professional-style baseball with amenities including multiple concession stands, a playground and group event areas.</p>
<p>The City, PDC and Rose City Baseball continue to team up on phased improvements to the stadium which include new chair-back seating, the addition of group event areas, a new scoreboard, team offices, a new press box, new concession services, new dugouts, a major league backstop, a new irrigated grass playing surface and a children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Bureau and our City are delighted to partner with the Pickles in bringing baseball back to the Rose City. I know the team will be a source of pride for all of Portland as a whole,&rdquo; says Portland parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp;&ldquo;This partnership has resulted in improved livability for Lents neighbors and for other parts of east Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the partnership, Parks Commissioner Fritz added, the much-needed renovations to Walker Stadium would not be occurring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lents is in a part of town &ndash; east Portland - that deserves an improved parks and recreation experience,&rdquo; added Fritz, &ldquo;and this endeavor is a solid complement to the new parks which PP&amp;R is building in east Portland &ndash; <a href=""/parks/65392"">Luuwit View</a> Park and <a href=""/parks/66064"">Gateway Discovery Park</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Development Commission&rsquo;s investment is consistent with our commitments to the community and neighborhood,&rdquo; says outgoing PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are delighted that Rose City Baseball will hire local youth and develop partnerships with local community-based organizations.&nbsp; Since 1998, PDC has made more than $5 million in investments in parks and open space in the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal Area&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>About the Great West League</strong></p>

</ol>
<p>As of June 4, 2016,&nbsp;PP&amp;R determined priority sites to be Multnomah Arts Center (MAC), Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum and Fulton Community Center.&nbsp;Only&nbsp;one of these sites, MAC, has had test&nbsp;results&nbsp;that cause&nbsp;concerns. Consequently, drinking fountains have been taken out of service and all sinks have been labeled ""Do not drink"" at MAC. At Fulton and Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, we have initiated a flushing protocol prior to opening the facility each day, in partnership with the community operators of those sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?ShowResults=yes&amp;SearchText=multnomah+arts+center"">Multnomah Arts Center&nbsp;</a></strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R leadership learned late&nbsp;in the day on Friday, June 3, 2016, that in 2013,&nbsp;drinking fountains at Multnomah Art Center (MAC) had elevated lead test results,&nbsp;and were&nbsp;replaced or installed with filters on Tuesday, May 31, 2016. The reason for the delayed action is under&nbsp;review.&nbsp;The&nbsp;fountains have not yet been retested to confirm that remediation is complete.&nbsp;PP&amp;R leadership also learned on June 3 that elevated levels of lead were detected in 2011, 2012 and 2013 for some sinks at MAC. Some corrective actions were taken for sinks by 2013, but PP&amp;R is still reviewing those records. As a precautionary measure until&nbsp;all retesting is complete, PP&amp;R&nbsp;has shut down the fountains and marked that sinks are not for drinking, and will provide&nbsp;bottled drinking water for all MAC staff and visitors until retesting is completed and all necessary corrective actions are confirmed. Test results available for viewing by <a href=""/parks/article/579310"">clicking here.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation did not notify the Commissioner in Charge or the MAC community of these test results when they occurred, and that&nbsp;we&nbsp;did not ensure that&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;were&nbsp;in place to ensure immediate and complete remediation,""&nbsp;said PP&amp;R Director Mike&nbsp;Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Over the coming weeks, we will review what happened and institute new safety and reporting protocols. We are retesting the site so that our staff and visitors can be assured that lead levels for drinking water are within EPA guidelines. Working with our partners at the Portland Water Bureau, we will also prioritize testing at Fulton Community Center and the Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, even though&nbsp;we have no previous elevated lead level results at those sites. We will publish testing results as soon as possible.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have directed PP&amp;R to institute immediate testing of the three priority park&nbsp;sites, and to work with technical experts to review the potential need for periodic systematic&nbsp;testing throughout our facilities,&rdquo; said Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I have also requested information&nbsp;on remediation work that has occurred in the past at all Parks facilities, and&nbsp;an&nbsp;explanation of&nbsp;the delay in taking action at Multnomah Arts Center. We know that many Parks buildings have infrastructure such as pipes that needs replacing. I will continue to prioritize public safety and prudent investments to keep working on fixing our aging parks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other priority sites: Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Fulton Community Center</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;have historical testing information for either of these sites, however with all that we understand at this time, PP&amp;R believes the risk of potential lead exposure in drinking water&nbsp;at these sites is very low.&nbsp;Therefore,&nbsp;while testing of all fountains and sinks is being completed in the coming weeks, PP&amp;R is working with&nbsp;staff at the sites to perform&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily &ldquo;flushing&rdquo;&nbsp;protocol every morning.</p>

<p><strong>POSTED JUNE 3, 2016<br /><br /></strong>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<h2>Celebration of Portland&rsquo;s new neighborhood jewel, starting construction in east Portland</h2>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Mayor Charlie Hales, and Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announce the groundbreaking of <a href=""/parks/65392"">Luuwit View Park</a> (pronounced loo-WIT), between NE Fremont St. and NE Shaver St.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT: </strong>Groundbreaking celebration of Luuwit View Park</p>
<p><strong>WHEN: </strong>Saturday, June 4, 2016, 11am-12pm</p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong> Shaver Elementary School, 3701 NE 131<sup>st</sup> Place, Portland</p>
<p>Enjoy cake, a Native American blessing ceremony, and special guest speakers.</p>
<p>Spread on 16 acres adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in northeast Portland&rsquo;s Argay neighborhood, Luuwit View Park will offer expansive views &ndash; including a majestic vista of Luuwit - the name people of the upper Cowlitz have for the iconic Mt. St. Helens. The park&rsquo;s name helps to honor the indigenous people who have lived on the land since time immemorial, and to recognize the overall history of the area. The City also recognizes the significant farming history of the land.</p>
<p><em>The park will serve nearly <strong>1000</strong> new households</em>, ones which currently do not have ready access to a park.</p>
<p>Luuwit View Park is expected to open in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With years of collaboration between the City and community members, this park will be a great asset to nearly 1,000 households once it&rsquo;s completed,&rdquo; says Portland Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to join the community and the Bureau in celebrating the addition of Luuwit View Park to our renowned parks system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The groundbreaking of Luuwit View Park represents another major milestone in my time as the Commissioner for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; says Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Right now only 2 of 5 residents enjoy easy access to a park in this area of east Portland. Luuwit View will allow Argay Terrace neighbors to enjoy new options for play, relaxation and reflection that they have been awaiting for more than 40 years. I commend our neighborhood partners for their vision and tenacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about the new park, one we&rsquo;ve been eagerly anticipating for so long, says Nina Palacios, a member of the Luuwit View naming committee. &ldquo;I volunteer at the adjacent Shaver School, and the kids there are bursting with anticipation!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Fast Facts on </strong><strong>Luuwit View Park:</strong></p>
<p><em>Features</em></p>
<p><em>-</em> Adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in the Parkrose School District, in the Argay neighborhood of NE Portland. Luuwit View Park will feature large, expansive lawns, an accessible playground, a fog garden where water mists out to play in, grand views, a youth sports field, a full-size basketball court and a teen area. The latter will include a climbing structure, two ping pong tables, a group seating area; and a skate park. The entire teen area will be covered, with colorful sports court surfacing.&nbsp; Other park features include accessible picnic areas, a shelter, a restroom, foot and bike paths, parking, community gardens, and a fenced off-leash dog area. A multi-use paved trail will circle around the entire site, and public art and bilingual interpretive signage will be incorporated into key areas.</p>
<p><em>Equity/Equal Access</em></p>
<p>-Luuwit View Park will serve 965 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 49% of these households are racial and ethnic minorities, and 23% are experiencing poverty. The park design meets all accessibility standards.</p>
<p><em>Funding</em></p>
<p><em>-</em> Project construction cost is estimated at $8.4 million, from <a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks System Development Charges</a> (not General Fund tax dollars). This estimate includes a park restroom (added during the design process) and $200,000 for construction contingencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is extremely exciting to see Luuwit View Park begin its long-awaited construction,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The park will have amazing views, which is fitting because we are building the park that the neighbors have long envisioned. It has a prime location in the neighborhood and right next door to Shaver Elementary School. Luuwit View Park will be a special place for current and future generations of park visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Director Abbat&eacute; noted that the park is also close to Parkrose Middle School and Parkrose High School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name &lsquo;Luuwit View Park&rsquo; holds meaning on many different levels&rdquo;, says Cary Watters, a member of the Tlingit Tribe and of the park naming committee. &ldquo;The fact that this park's honors the traditional way in which our people named places, is a huge step forward in healing - not only for the Native community, but for the land and the at-large community.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City. Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/38516""><strong>System Development Charges</strong></a><strong>, </strong>the funding being used to create the two new parks in east Portland (not General Fund tax dollars) are restricted to expanding capacity only. SDCs cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is also insufficient to fully address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area&ldquo;, adds Commissioner Fritz, who designated Luuwit View Park (and Gateway Discovery Park) for development after careful consideration of community input.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Pools are getting ready for summer!</strong></p>
<p>Another summer of swimming and other aquatic activities will kick off this month at the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) pools. Opening day for PP&amp;R&rsquo;s outdoor pools is Tuesday, June 14, 2016. Parents who want to enroll their children in swimming lessons should act now. Please remember that Grant Pool is closed for renovations, expected to be open by August, if not before.</p>
<p>As part of the PP&amp;R <a href=""/parks/61921"">Summer Free For All</a>, free open play swim sessions are offered throughout the summer at pools across the city. <a href=""/parks/article/489147"">Click here</a> for schedules.</p>

<p><strong>More good news! For the first time in several years, all PP&amp;R indoor AND outdoor pools will be open to the public for swimming on Independence Day, Monday, July 4.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is pleased that the City&rsquo;s Adopted Budget includes our requested funding to reopen Montavilla Pool on Sundays this summer,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Funding reductions in recent years had meant we had to cut back the hours at that popular site; but City Council has seen the value of Montavilla Pool being open seven days a week. This expands our recreational offerings during our peak summer season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Director Abbat&eacute; and Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz also note that the City&rsquo;s budget resulted in funding to keep Buckman Pool open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation pools also offer open play swims, water exercise classes, junior lifeguard training, junior swim instructor training, summer swim teams, and special events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swim lessons are available for all age groups and ability levels. Most sessions include 10 lessons for $52.50. There is also a FREE <em>Learn to Swim</em> session from June 14-17.

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announces allocation of $6 million in investments over the next few years for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=501"">Parklane Park</a>, SE 155<sup>th</sup> and Main in east Portland. The funding will go towards the park&rsquo;s first phase of development, and comes from development fees known as <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charge</a> revenue (<em>not</em> General Fund tax dollars).</p>
<p class=""Default"">Commissioner Fritz and PP&amp;R aim to achieve the full vision of the <a href=""/parks/article/469551"">Parklane Park Master Plan</a>, but recognize that the full park development may need to be completed in phases. The park site encompasses 25 acres in far southeast Portland, an area that has fewer parks and green spaces than other parts of Portland. Only five of the park&rsquo;s 25 acres are currently developed. When fully developed, <strong>Parklane Park will serve</strong><strong> 2,119 households</strong>, including <strong>357 new households</strong> not already served by another park or natural area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have worked hard with the community to identify the greatest needs in east Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Compared with other areas of the City, far fewer people in east Portland currently enjoy easy access to a park or natural area. The community has a vision for Parklane Park, and this $6 million investment will be an important step towards realizing the community&rsquo;s goals. The park has 25 acres of land, and a completed Master Plan. Both of these factors make it an ideal site to develop more fully for the benefit of current and future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site of Parklane Park was originally Native American land. More recently, it was used as an airfield, and then a s a gravel quarry which was later filled with remnant debris. Due to the potential required environmental remediation of the land and other site conditions, the first priority for further Phase I park development will be to investigate the condition of undeveloped portion of the park site. This will allow PP&amp;R to understand what park elements are possible to include in the first phase budget.</p>
<p>After site remediation has been addressed, PP&amp;R will engage in an extensive public involvement process. This will allow the community to work with staff to prioritize elements identified in the <a href=""/parks/article/469551"">Parklane Park Master Plan</a>, and determine which of them can be implemented in the next few years. The timing of the public process, and of planning, construction, etc., is being determined. PP&amp;R expects to begin public outreach for the project in 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once completed, Parklane Park will be one of the largest parks in outer southeast Portland, and serve more than 2100 families,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;There is an abundance of open land with views of Mt. Hood and the broad skyscape. Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s funding allocation means we can move forward on realizing the established vision of Parklane as a destination for sports, exercise, contemplation, unstructured play, special events, and much more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class=""Default"">The currently developed portion of Parklane Park includes an accessible play area, drinking fountains, a basketball court, park paths, picnic tables, park benches, a softball field, and a soccer field. Future Parklane Park elements identified in the Master Plan will need to be completed in phases, and are subject to available funds and technical feasibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those of us living in the Centennial neighborhood took a look at the Master Plan for Parklane Park, and instantly recognized the potential for it to become a signature park in east Portland,&rdquo; says neighborhood advocate Tom Lewis, who has lived near the park for more than 60 years. &ldquo;Through these investments, the City is helping to give our youth a constructive place for sports and play, and a site to meet friends from near and far. The Centennial Community Association thanks Commissioner Fritz for helping east Portland move toward greater equity and equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz vows to seek and direct more funding for Parklane Park, above and beyond what it is currently allocated, and as new SDC revenue projections are determined. Over the last two years, Commissioner Fritz and Director Abbat&eacute; have designated tens of millions of dollars to begin to address parks infrastructure inequities in east Portland&mdash;including building the new <a href=""/parks/66064"">Gateway Discovery Park</a> (construction now underway) and <a href=""/parks/luuwitview"">Luuwit View Park</a> (construction starts in June, 2016). There are also now new trails at Clatsop Butte Park, master planning processes for Mill and Midland Parks, and for a future park at SE 150th &amp; Division.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by Portlanders in 2014, some of the changes in east Portland residents will see include five new loos, restored tennis courts at Argay Park, a replacement for the Ventura Park playground, a new playground at Lynchview Park and a variety of ADA upgrades at these sites as well.</p>
<p><br /> <strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>

The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty. PP&amp;R has additional and unfunded growth needs of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Funding for the next step in Parklane Park&rsquo;s development comes not from General Fund Tax dollars, but from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (SDCs).&nbsp; These are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Park SDCs are restricted by law and can only be used to expand capacity (rather than to maintain or repair existing park facilities). SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.</p>
<p>However, SDCs are unfortunately insufficient to fully address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods.</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park.&nbsp;That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area&ldquo;, adds Commissioner Fritz, who designated the $6M in SDC funding for Parklane Park after careful consideration of community input.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong><em>Public/private partnership helps bring Portland free summer movies, concerts and more</em></strong></p>
<p>Building on a multi-year partnership, Comcast announced that it will become the Title Sponsor for <a href=""/parks/35300"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a>&rsquo;s (PP&amp;R) the 2016 <a href=""/parks/61921"">Summer Free For All</a> program. Support from Comcast, the information and entertainment provider to the most homes in Portland, will help PP&amp;R deliver the popular, free summer program series to an audience that topped 320,000 attendees in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=576873"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful to Comcast for their support of the beloved Summer Free For All program,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Comcast&rsquo;s commitment to the Summer Free For All title sponsorship shows their passion for making our community better and helps deliver dozens of free outdoor movies, concerts, and playground and lunch programs to Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comcast is thrilled to be the title sponsor of the Summer Free For All program,&rdquo; said Rodrigo Lopez, Regional Senior Vice-President of Comcast Oregon and Southwest Washington.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are proud to support families, friends and neighbors coming together in parks and playgrounds all over Portland to enjoy live performances and movies under the stars.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program&rsquo;s uniqueness stems in part from its broad base of community support. This year, hundreds of donors, including local businesses, community groups, neighborhood associations, and individuals, will give generously to a program that is tailored to offer the best of entertainment, including local and regional talent, at Portland&rsquo;s parks.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s SFFA includes 55 <a href=""/parks/69555"">Concerts in the Park</a>, 41 <a href=""/parks/69554"">Movies in the Park</a>, 27 <a href=""/parks/69873"">Summer Playgrounds &amp; Lunch</a> sites, 20 Mobile Playgrounds sites, Free Swim sessions at all of PP&amp;R&rsquo;s indoor <em>and</em> outdoor pools, and the Washington Park Summer Festival.&nbsp; In addition, a Children&rsquo;s Concert Series at Unthank Park is new this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our <a href=""/parks/57733"">mission</a> is for &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Summer Free For All is a wonderful way that many people first engage with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation programs.&nbsp; Companies like Comcast help make these connections possible, leading to a lifetime of healthier, happier people of all ages.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Portland Development Commission and partners welcome all to the Gateway Discovery Park Groundbreaking- a celebration of Portland&rsquo;s newest park, starting construction in east Portland</h2>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announce the groundbreaking of <a href=""/parks/66064"">Gateway Discovery Park</a>, set for Saturday, May 7, at 11am. The new park and urban plaza will encompass nearly four acres off NE Halsey St between NE 104<sup>th</sup> and 106<sup>th </sup>avenues, and is being built in partnership with the Portland Development Commission (PDC).&nbsp;<em>Gateway Discovery Park will serve nearly 800 households which do not currently have ready access to a park or natural area.&nbsp;</em>The community groundbreaking celebration includes a Native American blessing of the land, cake, special guest speakers, and is free and open to all.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=575579"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT: Gateway Discovery Park groundbreaking celebration<br /></strong><strong>WHERE: Site of the future Gateway Discovery Park, NE Halsey Street and 106<sup>th </sup>Avenue<br /></strong><strong>WHEN: Saturday, May 7, 2016 - &nbsp;11am-12pm</strong></p>
<p>Special guest speakers include Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Mike Abbat&eacute;, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director, PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton, Harper&rsquo;s Playground Executive Director G Cody QJ Goldberg, and Fred Sanchez, Past President of the Gateway Area Business Association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The groundbreaking of Gateway Discovery Park represents another major milestone in my work with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to increase East Portland residents&rsquo; access to parks,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Now, the park site begins its transformation from a vacant lot to a welcoming, vibrant neighborhood plaza and gathering space for the Hazelwood and Parkrose Heights neighborhoods. I hope it will be a catalyst for economic development in Gateway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gateway Discovery Park will feature an inclusive play area thanks to <a href=""http://harpersplayground.org/pages/coming-soon-a-harpers-playground-project-at-gateway-park"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a> (see below), natural play elements such as a boulder hill and slide, a water play fountain to splash in, a sand and water play area, a skateboarding area, lights, a large open grass area, a performance space, a plaza, seating, and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is extremely exciting to see Gateway Discovery Park begin its long-awaited construction,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Gateway Discovery Park will be a vibrant neighborhood park, as well as an urban plaza, with space for recreation, reflection, <a href=""/parks/61921"">Summer Free For All</a> activities, and special events year-round.&nbsp; It will be a vital part of our city, well into the future&ldquo;.</p>
<p>As the park construction gets under way, programming work is also beginning on the one-acre parcel adjacent to the site, which will be redeveloped into a mixed-use development through a partnership led by PDC and including the Portland Housing Bureau, Gerding-Edlen and Human Solutions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the next five years, PDC and the city will invest more than $25 million throughout Gateway, adding to the area&rsquo;s commercial activity and vibrancy,&rdquo; says PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s groundbreaking marks this multi-year series of significant investments to promote and reinforce Gateway&rsquo;s identity as a family-friendly, multi-generational, and multi-cultural neighborhood that serves all its residents.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>GATEWAY DISCOVERY PARK &ndash; SITE OF PORTLAND&rsquo;S NEWEST ACCESSIBLE PLAY AREA</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://harpersplayground.org/pages/coming-soon-a-harpers-playground-project-at-gateway-park"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a><strong> </strong>committed to raising the funds to make the new Gateway Discovery Park the site of Portland&rsquo;s next inclusive, barrier-free playground: the second in the City of Portland. Their first project is at Arbor Lodge Park in north Portland. The non-profit group participated on the Project Advisory Committee and advised on inclusive design and community engagement. The committee and the community were very receptive and committed to creating a Gateway Discovery Park play area that supported the participation of ALL children. Harper&rsquo;s Playground continues to advocate for inclusive playgrounds citywide and across the country.</p>
<p>""We are extremely honored to be involved with the Gateway Discovery Park project,&rdquo; says G Cody QJ Goldberg, Executive Director of Harper&rsquo;s Playground.&nbsp;&ldquo;The park will be an incredible asset for the immediate neighborhood as well as the entire city. We look forward to playing alongside new friends of all abilities once this special park is open for business.""</p>
<p><strong>Fast Facts on </strong><strong>Gateway Discovery Park:</strong></p>
<p>A partnership project with Portland Development Commission</p>
<p><strong><em>Features<br /></em></strong>The<em> </em>nearly four-acre<em> </em>park will become a &ldquo;living room&rdquo; for the Gateway community, featuring accessible spaces and activities for all ages, including a plaza ready to accommodate a variety of events, festivals, and farmers' markets. As envisioned in the Master Plan, the park will also include flexible green spaces to accommodate picnic areas, accessible playground features and nature play.</p>
<p><strong><em>Equity/Equal Access<br /></em></strong>The park will serve more than 800 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 36% of these households are racial and ethnic minorities, and 28% are experiencing poverty.</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding<br /></strong></em>Project construction cost is estimated at $5.2 million, which includes $4.2 million from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (not General Fund tax dollars) and $1 million from The Portland Development Commission (PDC).</p>
<p>PP&amp;R thanks the valued volunteers and partners who&rsquo;ve committed time and input into the Gateway Discovery Park project. Special thanks to Harper&rsquo;s Playground, Portland Development Commission, Gateway Area Business Association, area neighborhood and community associations, and the community at large for their participation and continued support for the new park.</p>
<p>Gateway Discovery Park is one of two new parks beginning construction in east Portland this year (along with the soon-to-be constructed <a href=""/parks/65392"">Loowit View Park</a>).&nbsp;<strong>Once completed, the two parks will serve nearly 1800 households which do not currently have ready access to a park or natural area. </strong>In 2014, Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz dedicated <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charge</a> funds (revenue from new construction development in Portland) towards these projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain<br /></strong>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City. Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a>, the funding being used to create the Gateway Discovery Park (<em>not</em> General Fund tax dollars), are restricted to expanding capacity only. SDCs cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is also insufficient to fully address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park.&nbsp;That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area&ldquo;, adds Commissioner Fritz, who designated Loowit View and Gateway Discovery Parks for development after careful consideration of community input. Commissioner Fritz considered four worthy park options that were ready to build in east Portland &ndash; those with completed Master Plans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>All are welcome to join community partners and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation at the second annual Cambodian/Lao/Thai/Burmese New Year in the Park. Four vibrant Southeast Asian cultures join together for a day full of food, music, dance and games on Saturday, April 30, 2016. More than 6,000 people from diverse cultural backgrounds attended last year.&nbsp;<strong>Portland Mayor Charlie Hales will be the 2016 keynote speaker.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /><br />WHAT:</strong>&nbsp;Second annual Cambodian/Lao/Thai/Burmese New Year in the Park</p>
<p><strong>WHERE:</strong>&nbsp;Glenhaven Park, NE 82<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;Avenue and Siskiyou Street<span style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;""><br /><br /></span><strong>WHEN:</strong>&nbsp;10am&ndash;6pm on&nbsp;Saturday, April 30, 2016</p>
<p><strong>WHY:</strong>&nbsp;A chance to celebrate with Portland&rsquo;s Cambodian, Lao, Thai, and Burmese communities, each of which celebrate New Year in April.</p>
<p><strong>WHO:</strong>&nbsp;All are welcome to this free and exciting cultural celebration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is increasingly culturally diverse, and much of that has come with the integration of refugees and immigrants into our community,&rdquo; says Mayor Charlie Hales, the event&rsquo;s keynote speaker. &ldquo;From the Jade Night Market, to the Portland Mercado, to the Cambodian/Lao/Thai/Burmese New Year in the Park, Portland is made richer because we&rsquo;ve welcomed new neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many immigrant and refugee families have faced tremendous challenges,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;It is important that Portland parks are inclusive of our diverse communities.This multicultural New Year Celebration is another important step towards the inclusion of all Portlanders in enjoyment of our shared parks.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cambodia, Laotian, Thai and Burmese cultures all celebrate New Year each April, but historically, Portland&rsquo;s communities always held separate celebrations. Now, for the second straight year, the different but equally fascinating languages and cultures are coming together to celebrate.</p>
<p>The list of performers, games and food vendors includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Performances</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cambodian Dance Troupe of Oregon, Cambodian American Community of Oregon, Khana Luke Larn Lao Dance Troupe, Kinnaly Lao Music &amp; Dance Troupe, Thai Bumblebee, Thai Association, Burmese Community of Oregon</li>

<p>&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s parks, natural areas and programs are for <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">everyone</span>,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. We want <em>all </em>Portlanders, regardless of culture, background, ethnicity or gender to know that the parks belong to you. We will continue to work hard to remove or reduce barriers to access and participation for everyone, including communities of color, people with disabilities, or recent immigrants. Welcome to <em>your </em>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our communities are so excited to bring our cultures together, and for another chance to celebrate and share our heritage,&rdquo; says Youthachak Chanthanouvong, the newly-elected merchant vendor Co-Chair for the New Year in the Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>History of New Year in the Park<br /></strong>Saron Khut, the owner of the Cambodian restaurant Mekong Bistro, had the idea to plan a Cambodian New Year celebration at Glenhaven Park, across the street from his restaurant. One day, a few Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) staff came in for lunch, and Saron approached them about the possibility of sponsoring the event. PP&amp;R happily signed on, and the event expanded to include the Lao community with help from Saron&rsquo;s wife, who is Lao, and the Lao Business Association, and then members of the Thai and Burmese communities. The event promises another collaboration by and celebration of a group of relatively recently-arrived immigrants and refugees in their new and shared home state of Oregon.</p>

2016,572136,Park sprinklers running in the rain? Is it still April Fools?,2,,2016-05-10 23:38:40 UTC,2016-04-08 17:41:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>POSTED APRIL 8, 2016</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Starting this month (April 2016), Portland Park &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) staff will be activating irrigation systems across the city. Part of this process will include adjustments and repairs where workers need to have sprinkler and irrigation systems turned on during the day.</p>
<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=572135"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""257.85"" /></p>
<p>Some of this work on more than 150 automatic sprinkler systems across the city may occur <em>during rainy days</em>, which can strike a casual observer as an unusual sight.&nbsp; However, PP&amp;R staff must conduct this work now to ensure that all of the city&rsquo;s park irrigation systems are fully functional for the hot summer months.&nbsp; PP&amp;R irrigation systems are used on grass at parks and athletic fields, and give plants supplemental water.</p>
<p>Though sprinklers running in the rain may cause one to do a double-take, this is in fact a common and effective industry practice.&nbsp; In this case, de-winterizing PP&amp;R sprinkler systems during the month of April (and sometimes during March, too) is indeed a normal operating procedure.</p>
<p>Therefore, park visitors may see water flying at all times of the day, even if it is raining. The importance of getting our irrigation systems ready for the upcoming dryer months is crucial to the overall water conservation efforts put forth at Portland Parks and Recreation.</p>
<p>The irrigation systems in our parks sit idle for many months. During this time, the sprinkler heads may lose their alignment, have turf grow completely over them, or be damaged from the elements. To ensure proper operation, systematically each sprinkler zone is activated and thoroughly inspected. This can range from a few minutes to 10 minutes depending on the type of sprinkler and the extent of the coverage. Items staff will check are:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>That the sprinkler pop-up height clears the surrounding grass.</li>
<li>The alignment is perpendicular to the surrounding grade.</li>
<li>The sprinkler is operating correctly.</li>
<li>The arc and radius are properly adjusted.</li>
<li>There are no leaks or seal damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff are committed to safety, efficiency, and the enjoyment of all park visitors.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks&nbsp;&amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is looking for partners/vendors to help activate (hold activities and events at) Ankeny Square in the North Park Blocks, located at NW Ankeny and W Burnside.<em> </em><em>Successful proposers will pay only $1 a year (for up to two years) to rent the park space.&nbsp; PP&amp;R welcomes creative ideas for</em><em> cultural, </em><em>retail and other possible endeavors at this bustling central city plaza.&nbsp; Proposals are due by April 20, 2016.</em></p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=572019"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""421.096605744"" /></p>
<p>The idea for more cool happenings at the square came from neighbors and businesses surrounding the park, and is fully supported by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. PP&amp;R would like to create positive experiences for the neighborhood and for visitors to the <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=447&amp;subareas=6"">North Park Blocks</a>.&nbsp; Across the PP&amp;R system, programmed activities are found to create a vibrant, engaging, and positive environment for parks and neighborhoods.&nbsp; The bureau also suggests that this opportunity may also provide a way for micro-businesses to generate revenue.</p>
<p>More information on the Ankeny Square endeavor, including instructions on how to apply and the evaluation criteria, can be found on our website <a href=""/parks/article/570208"">here</a>.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R hopes that the <a href=""/parks/article/570575"">Request For Interest (RFI)</a> encourages a competitive environment for this exciting opportunity.&nbsp; The bureau welcomes multiple proposals and is open to accepting several which could work in conjunction with each other (events/activities which could operate on different days, seasons, etc.) The <a href=""/parks/article/570575"">RFI</a> is designed to give all who may be interested an opportunity to suggest public-private partnerships, including those for permits or lease agreements depending on the nature of the response.</p>
<p>Ankeny Square is located&nbsp;between West Burnside and SW Ankeny, and&nbsp;between SW 8th Ave and SW Park Ave on the edge of the Pearl District in downtown Portland. Ankeny Square sits at the southern end of Portland's historic <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;ShowResults=yes&amp;PropertyID=447"">North Park Blocks</a>, and has long been an integral part of downtown life.&nbsp; One of the city&rsquo;s oldest public spaces, the North Park Blocks were dedicated to the City by Captain John Couch (yep, like the street!) in 1869.</p>
<p>This week, several maintenance crews including carpenters, painters, electrical and mechanical workers are sprucing up the PP&amp;R buildings in Ankeny Square. Fencing is expected to be up for around two weeks as crews clean, paint, and shine up this historic space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Construction is now underway to replace the mechanical systems (which date to the 1920s and 1940s, see photo) and improve accessibility at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/69736"">Grant Pool</a>. PP&amp;R expects to reopen the pool in early August 2016, and hopefully even sooner.</p>
<p><img class=""content-center"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=571986"" alt="""" width=""640"" height=""295.04"" /></p>
<p>Thanks to overwhelming voter support of the <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, PP&amp;R is able to begin this important project (and many others citywide) to repair some of the most critical components of the City&rsquo;s park system. Without these much-needed repairs, PP&amp;R had been faced with likely not opening Grant Pool for the entire 2016 summer.</p>
<p>Much of Grant Pool&rsquo;s crumbling inner workings have been unchanged since the 1920s. This infrastructure will be replaced, along with: plumbing, pumps, motors, pipes, strainer baskets, chemical controllers, sanitation systems, pool gutters, deck drains, and filters. The work will also include ADA accessibility improvements: fixing cross slope issues on the deck and the installation of two new pool lifts.</p>
<p>The Grant Pool renovations were delayed for about two months due to a setback with the construction bidding and procurement process. This was a disappointing setback, though one outside of the City&rsquo;s control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that Grant Pool is a treasured asset for the community and in dire need of repair. That is why we have prioritized it as the first Parks Bond project to be completed,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PP&amp;R staff have done the best they could to fix and maintain Grant Pool&rsquo;s rusted, nearly 100 year-old inner workings with the resources they have had. We deeply regret the procurement delays and understand that an August opening is far from ideal. We share the disappointment of all who love Grant Pool. I am thankful for the overwhelming voter support for the Bond that allows this pool to be repaired so that it will be functional for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a perfect world, our summer season would not be impacted,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Our staff has done the best they could to keep the pool running, season after season. But the past solution of patchwork repairs over the years was no longer viable. This project will ensure future seasons will not be impacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What is the Grant Pool construction schedule? </strong></p>
<p>Construction began in early March 2016. Project completion is expected by the end of July 2016, with the pool opening in early August 2016 (or possibly sooner). PP&amp;R has built an incentive for early completion into the contract, and the contractor, <a href=""http://www.2kgcontractors.com/index.html"">2KG</a>, is doing everything they can to finish early and ahead of schedule. PP&amp;R will provide updates as the planned opening date approaches. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why was the project delayed?</strong></p>
<p>The City of Portland bidding process follows a set of standard procurement rules that all City bureaus must follow, and PP&amp;R cannot change the rules or the process. They are designed to protect competitive bidding and ensure transparent business processes. So unfortunately, PP&amp;R had to start the bidding process again, resulting in a delay of two crucial months. Delaying the project until after the 2016 summer swim season was ruled out, as Grant Pool's mechanical condition was so deteriorated that opening it at all was in jeopardy.&nbsp; No one in the Bureau wanted to risk having the pool closed for the entire swim season.</p>
<p><strong>What took place prior to construction?</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R has undertaken extensive planning work for months. Bond funds approved in November 2014 were released to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation on July 1, 2015.&nbsp; Before beginning construction, PP&amp;R had to complete design development, construction documents, permitting, and bidding processes.</p>
<p><strong>Why can&rsquo;t construction be done <em>after</em> the summer season?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Grant Pool&rsquo;s mechanical systems were in such poor condition that PP&amp;R would have be faced with not opening the pool at all this summer if these repairs were not performed this year. Thankfully, rather than going all summer (or even indefinitely) without a pool, the community will instead experience only a temporary hiccup for part of the 2016 summer.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I swim, take lessons, or join a swim team league during the Grant Pool closure?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>We expect that Grant Pool will be open by August 2016 at the latest and hopefully earlier. Other nearby PP&amp;R pools are available for use at Creston Outdoor Pool and the indoor pools at Matt Dishman, Montavilla, and East Portland Community Centers. Swimming lesson registration for the 2016 summer session begins Monday, April 18, 2016, and Grant neighbors are welcome to register for a swim team at another pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grant Pool plans to have two sessions of swim lessons in August, and a couple of swim lesson sessions in September. Grant Pool is scheduled to remain open until October 9, 2016 to accommodate users of Matt Dishman Pool (which is scheduled to be closed for 6-8 weeks starting in mid-August for Bond project work to re-plaster the pool and replace the spa).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is the Parks Replacement Bond?</strong></p>
<p>The Parks Replacement Bond was passed with the support of over 73% of voters in November 2014. Its primary focus is on repair and replacement of the most critical needs in the parks system. The total bond is for $68 million, and work has begun on the first list of 32 Bond projects citywide.</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which takes aim at a $248M funding gap for major maintenance needs over the next ten years. Further, PP&amp;R anticipates $472M in unfunded <em>growth</em> needs during that period. That adds up to a $720M funding gap over the next decade, which Commissioner Fritz will continue to work with Council to address. Currently, 20% of people living in Portland do NOT have access to a park or natural area within a 15 minute walk, and the bureau is working hard to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;. PP&amp;R data show that pools are one of the bureau&rsquo;s most widely utilized features, and we recognize their importance to the community.</p>

The closure impacts the fields at SE Portland's Westmoreland Park, and all PP&amp;R fields west of the Willamette River. All other PP&amp;R athletic fields and ball fields are now reopen for permitted use and drop-in play (pending availability). <br /> <br /> Portland Parks &amp; Recreation originally closed ALL city-owned grass athletic and ballfields two weeks ago, and re-evaluated conditions today. The decision to keep some of PP&amp;R's fields closed is due to safety concerns and saturated conditions related to recent heavy rain. <br /> <br /> This closure impacts grass fields at the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites mentioned above, and events which PP&amp;R had permitted at Portland Public Schools facilities. On Thursday, March 31, 2016, PP&amp;R will re-evaluate conditions at the grass fields and make a determination on if the closures need to be extended, with user safety in mind. The current closures do NOT impact synthetic turf fields, which are designed for all-weather play. <br /> <br /> Sustained rains and wet conditions across the city have left many PP&amp;R athletic fields with standing water, mud, slippery turf, and other poor conditions that may impact athletes' safety. Conditions have also hampered the ability for PP&amp;R maintenance crews to care for the fields. Although precipitation levels are not as heavy as they were earlier in the month, the relatively low temperatures and lack of sun are keeping fields from being able to dry out. The forecast is starting to look more typical in the coming weeks, and PP&amp;R is hopeful that this will be the last week of field closures. <br /> <br /> Portland Parks &amp; Recreation turf experts stressed the importance of preserving the grass at this time of the year, noting that damage inflicted now will be much harder to repair later in the year when more users are expected to use the fields. <br /> <br /> People who secured field permits will receive rainout credits for the closures, determined during PP&amp;R's end of the season assessment. Please note that fields that are closed for permitted use are also be closed for drop-in use. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation makes safety its top priority, though we understand some athletes will be disappointed by the bureau's need to close the fields.</p>

<h1><strong>About the Evans Scholarship</strong></h1>
<p>Famed golfer Charles ""Chick"" Evans, Jr. grew up in the Chicago area in the early 1900s. Evans earned money by caddying at the local country club. Wanting to go to college, he found that he could not afford it, nor was there anyone to help him. In 1916, Evans won both the US Amateur and the US Open golf tournaments, and with the victories came considerable wealth and fame. Determined to help others in his former situation, he started the Evans Scholars Foundation. It is currently one of the country&rsquo;s largest, privately funded scholarship programs.</p>
<p>Supported by the Western Golf Association, the Chick Evans Caddie Scholarship&nbsp;provides full housing and tuition to deserving caddies across the country. Currently,&nbsp;910 caddies are attending college on scholarship; there are more than 10,000 Evans alumni worldwide. Most Evans Scholars attend one of the 14 universities where the Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.</p>

<p>Due to the continued effects of recent heavy rains, all Portland Parks &amp; Recreation grass athletic fields and ballfields will remain closed through at least Friday, March 25, 2016.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) originally closed all city-owned grass athletic and ballfields for one week, and re-evaluated conditions today. The bureau must now extend the closure until at least Friday, March 25, 2016, due to safety concerns and saturated conditions related to recent heavy rain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This closure impacts grass fields at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation sites, and events which PP&amp;R had permitted at Portland Public Schools facilities. On Thursday, March 24, 2016, PP&amp;R will re-evaluate the grass fields and make a determination on if the closures need to be extended, with user safety in mind. The citywide closure does NOT impact synthetic turf fields, which are designed for all-weather play.</p>
<p>Sustained rains and wet conditions across the city have left many PP&amp;R athletic fields with standing water, mud, slippery turf, and other poor conditions that may impact athletes&rsquo; safety. The heavy and seemingly unending rain has also hampered the ability for PP&amp;R maintenance crews to care for the fields. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation turf experts stressed the importance of preserving the grass at this time of the year, noting that damage inflicted now will be much harder to repair later in the year when more users are expected to use the fields.</p>
<p>All people who have been granted permits for events on PP&amp;R athletic and ball fields will have their money refunded. Fields will also be closed for drop-in use. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation makes safety its top priority, though we understand some athletes will be disappointed by the bureau&rsquo;s need to close the fields.</p>

<h2>Portland Loo, plaza improvements and playground funded by Parks Replacement Bond, valued partner donations</h2>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), Friends of Couch Playground, and <a href=""http://harpersplayground.org/pages/harpers-playground-at-couch-park"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a> are pleased to share the final design for the new inclusive playground at Couch Park &ndash; accessible by everyone regardless of ability.&nbsp;The improvements at Couch Park (NW 19<sup>th</sup> Ave &amp; Glisan, adjacent to Portland Public Schools&rsquo; Metropolitan Learning Center School, or MLC) are part of the <a href=""/Parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, overwhelmingly approved by Portland voters in 2014.</p>
<p>Harper&rsquo;s Playground and Friends of Couch Playground have committed to fundraising an additional $500,000 by the fall of 2016 to supplement the project budget - creating a playground design that is as inclusive as possible.&nbsp; The community can get involved in this effort by contacting either of those organizations (contact info below).</p>
<p>The improvements at Couch Park include the playground (which replaces the old play area, removed in 2014 due to safety concerns), ADA accessibility improvements in the plaza, and addition of a Portland Loo to replace the aging, existing restroom (which will be repurposed for staff, maintenance, and storage use).</p>
<p>GreenWorks, PC, the Portland landscape architecture firm leading the design team, and PP&amp;R presented the play area&rsquo;s final design to the community at an open house on February 25, 2016. Community feedback on the design is welcome and may be submitted online through March 8, 2016 via the link at <a href=""http://www.parksreplacementbond.org"">parksreplacementbond.org</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commitment by our valued partners, Harper&rsquo;s Playground and Friends of Couch Playground, and the many businesses and neighbors who have contributed to the effort for inclusive play, shows the power of people coming together,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The partnerships are leveraging this critical Parks Replacement Bond project to stretch the funding even further, for the benefit of both current and future generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Harper's Playground is thrilled with the level of partnership we've experienced from Friends of Couch Playground,&rdquo; says Harper&rsquo;s Playground Executive Director G Cody QJ Goldberg. &ldquo;And the overwhelming support our partnership has generated in the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The total project budget (not-to-exceed allocation, for all three elements of playground, plaza, and new Portland Loo) is $2,210,903 of Parks Replacement Bond funds; not including the $500k commitment from partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends of Couch Playground is glad to be part of the work of rebuilding the Couch Park play area&rdquo;, says Lauren Nathe of Friends of Couch Playground. &ldquo;Partnering with Harper's Playground and PP&amp;R has given us the opportunity to support a play space that is welcoming of everybody and where all of us can play together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lauren Nathe&rsquo;s son, 8<sup>th</sup> grader Max, was one of two students from MLC School (the other in 6<sup>th</sup> grade) to have served on the Project Advisory Committee. Additionally, MLC students in 4<sup>th</sup>-6<sup>th</sup> grades spent the spring of 2015 studying the Couch Park design process, including during an elective class led by teacher Susan Beaird.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a kid who played on the old Couch Park playground for most of my life,&rdquo; says MLC 8<sup>th</sup> grader Max Nathe, who participated in the play area design process, &ldquo;I appreciate being able to represent Portland youth and the MLC students by participating and giving input on the design, for the benefit of current and future kids who will grow up playing on this new playground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As painful as it was to see the old, beloved Couch Park play equipment removed for safety concerns, it is just as gratifying to see neighbors, non-profits and the business community join together,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The new, inclusive play area will allow people of all abilities to enjoy unstructured play, to revel in the outdoors, and to foster a healthy community for all, right in line with our bureau&rsquo;s mission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Couch Park playground design is supported by a 10-member Project Advisory Committee (PAC). The PAC is composed of representatives from Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC) School, Friends of Couch Playground, Harper&rsquo;s Playground, Northwest District Association (NWDA), Portland Parks Board, Urban Forestry Commission, Congregation Beth Israel, Friendly House, and nearby neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>More help is needed to close the play gap.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation remains grateful to Portland voters for the $68 million Parks Replacement Bond, which funds critical needs across the PP&amp;R system. Currently, only four of five people living in Portland have access to a park or natural area within a 15 minute walk. As the bureau strives to close this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo;, it anticipates a $248M funding gap for maintenance over the next ten years, and $472M in unfunded growth needs during that period. That adds up to a $720M funding gap over the next decade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Despite the long-acknowledged challenges to our Parks system, we have made PP&amp;R a nationally-recognized parks bureau thanks to amazing staff, valuable public-private partnerships, friends and partner groups,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;This project illustrates the grave need for more money to maintain our system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

2016,565313,"LiUNA Local 483, Portland Parks & Recreation approve new agreement",2,,2016-02-18 00:28:35 UTC,2016-02-18 00:27:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>After decades of struggle, City recreation staff to receive fair wages</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>After years of accepting wages lower than other City workers, recreation staff working for the City of Portland have a reason to celebrate. The Portland City Council will vote this Wednesday (February 17, 2016) on an agreement between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and LiUNA Local 483 to bring into the union and provide fair pay and benefits to many recreation employees who perform work as &ldquo;casual&rdquo;, part-time, or seasonal employees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many Parks employees struggle with low wages, unable to afford their own housing or transportation. These staff members kept our community centers running even if it meant they couldn&rsquo;t afford to see a doctor or had to go on food stamps,&rdquo; said Will Ziegler, a staff member at Mt. Scott Community Center. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time that everyone who works for the City receives a living wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under this agreement, the City will only use union-represented employees to perform a large body of work now often done by casual employees. It also creates clear lines between staff positions. The bureau has requested in their FY2016-17 budget to fund these positions on an ongoing basis, to ensure recreation service levels aren&rsquo;t reduced.</p>
<p>The City will also recognize the rights of many of the recreation staff currently classified as &ldquo;casual&rdquo; employees to form a union. Once a majority show support for joining a union, an additional classification of Recreation Support Staff will have the ability to collectively bargain their wages, rights, and working conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cities should be in the business of uplifting residents, and building a community and economy that works for everyone,&rdquo; said Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;I am proud that we&rsquo;ve shown that the City of Portland is committed to fair labor practices with this Laborers&rsquo; Local 483 agreement. It will bring $15 an hour wages and job security to around 130 of previously unrepresented low-wage staff in our community centers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a significant achievement by parks management and our labor partners, collaborating to settle a longstanding dispute.&nbsp; It provides great opportunities for more equitable and fair wages for our workers. I look forward to the City Council supporting this agreement,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, a longtime supporter of increased wages for City employees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank our labor partners, management team and our Parks employees for coming together on this defining agreement,&rdquo; says Mike Abbat&eacute;, Parks Director. &ldquo;This shows that by working together, we can be an employer of choice while better serving our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ordinance will come before the City Council at 10:30am on Wednesday, February 17th. Once approved, Council will consider ongoing funding for around 130 positions through the City&rsquo;s budget process. If ongoing funding is approved through that process, this will ensure more Parks employees receive living wages and will create additional opportunities for fulltime work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking to the Council&rsquo;s leadership in the coming budget process to ensure funding for this agreement. All City workers deserve a living wage,&rdquo; said Wesley Buchholz, President of Laborer&rsquo;s Local 483.&nbsp;</p>

2016,562260,"New parks in east Portland to be named Luuwit View Park, Gateway Discovery Park",2,,2016-06-02 21:32:21 UTC,2016-01-28 19:23:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img title=""Rendering of Loowit View Park, courtesy of PP&amp;R and 2.ink Studio"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=562257"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announce the names of the two new east Portland parks which will begin construction this spring. Gateway Discovery Park will be the name of the park encompassing nearly four acres off NE Halsey Street between NE 104<sup>th</sup> &amp; 106<sup>th </sup>avenues, built in partnership with the Portland Development Commission (PDC). The 16-acre neighborhood park at NE 126th Avenue &amp; Beech Street (previously referred to as the Beech property) will be named Luuwit (pronounced loo-WIT) View Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Together, the two parks will serve nearly 1800 households which do not currently have ready access to a park or natural area.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz dedicated <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charge</a> funds (revenue from new construction development in Portland) to the two projects in 2014. In January 2015, PP&amp;R and the community began working together to develop the designs for the parks. The designs for both parks were finalized in the summer of 2015. Construction on the two new green spaces is scheduled to break ground in spring of 2016. <strong></strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R thanks the volunteers who served on park naming committees, comprising area neighbors, community advocates, representatives of traditionally underserved communities, and volunteers recruited and appointed by Commissioner Fritz and PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. Additionally, the Bureau thanks the Argay Terrace Neighborhood Association, Gateway Area Business Association, Hazelwood Neighborhood Association and the Parkrose Heights Neighborhood Associations for their participation and support in the design and naming processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These two new parks represent a significant step in addressing historic inequities in park facilities in east Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;All over Portland, people are telling me, &lsquo;Provide parks for people who don&rsquo;t have one.&rsquo; There are inequities in every neighborhood, and insufficient resources to correct them all. Luuwit View Park and Gateway Discovery Park continue the City&rsquo;s determination to correct the disparities in east Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation solicited park names through October 2015, from neighbors via public meetings, the PP&amp;R website and emails to community stakeholders. Potential names were weighed according to the vision and goals for each park and the guidelines stipulated in the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation <a href=""/parks/article/217384"">naming policy</a>. Both Luuwit View and Gateway Discovery Parks received nine name submissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is extremely exciting to see these park projects continue,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;A key milestone in the development of a new project is the name that the park will be known by for generations to come. We are so grateful to the naming committee, and to the Project Advisory Committee who, along with City staff, are guiding the development of these sites. Luuwit View and Gateway Discovery Parks will be memorable into the future&ldquo;.</p>

<p><strong>GATEWAY DISCOVERY PARK </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://harpersplayground.org/pages/coming-soon-a-harpers-playground-project-at-gateway-park"">Harper&rsquo;s Playground</a><strong> </strong>committed to raising the funds to make the new Gateway Discovery Park the site of Portland&rsquo;s next inclusive, barrier-free playground: the second in the City of Portland. Their first project is at Arbor Lodge Park in north Portland. The non-profit group participated on Project Advisory Committee and advised on inclusive design. The committee and the community were very committed to creating a play area that supported the participation of ALL children. Harper&rsquo;s Playground continues to advocate for inclusive playgrounds citywide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name &lsquo;Gateway Discovery Park&rsquo; invokes the same exciting sense of adventure that awaits in our entire neighborhood,&rdquo; says Linda Sanchez, a member of the park&rsquo;s naming committee. &ldquo;GABA &ndash; the Gateway Area Business Association &ndash; shares the excitement of east Portland neighbors for the amazing new gathering space coming soon. It will really be a gateway into Gateway!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Fast Facts on </strong><strong>Gateway Discovery Park:</strong></p>
<p><em>A partnership project with Portland Development Commission</em></p>
<p><em>Features<br /></em>The<em> </em>nearly four-acre<em> </em>park will become a &ldquo;living room&rdquo; for the Gateway neighborhood, featuring accessible spaces and activities for all ages, including a plaza ready to accommodate a variety of events, festivals, and farmers' markets. As envisioned in the Master Plan, the park will also include flexible green spaces to accommodate picnic areas, accessible playground features and nature play.</p>
<p><em>Equity/Equal Access<br /></em>The park will serve more than 800 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 36% of these households are racial and ethnic minorities, and 28% are experiencing poverty.</p>
<p><em>Funding<br /></em>Project construction cost is estimated at $5.2 million, which includes $4.2 million from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> (not General Fund tax dollars) and $1 million from The Portland Development Commission (PDC).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>LuuWIT VIEW PARK&nbsp;</strong><em>(pronounced loo-WIT)</em></p>
<p>Spread on 16 acres adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in northeast Portland&rsquo;s Argay neighborhood, Luuwit View Park will feature a soccer field and basketball court, accessible play and picnic areas, parking, community gardens, a fenced off-leash dog area, and foot and bike paths with expansive views &ndash; including a majestic vista of Luuwit (the Native American name for the iconic Mt. St. Helens).</p>
<p>The park will serve nearly 1000 new households, ones which currently do not have ready access to a park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recommending an appropriate name was difficult, but ultimately we enjoyed a rewarding outcome,&rdquo; says Nina Palacios, a member of the Luuwit View naming committee. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about the new park, one we&rsquo;ve been eagerly anticipating for so long.&nbsp; I volunteer at the adjacent Shaver School, and the kids there are bursting with anticipation for their new park!&nbsp; I very much appreciate being a part of the naming process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s name helps to honor the indigenous people who first lived on the land, and to recognize the overall history of the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name &lsquo;Luuwit View Park&rsquo; holds meaning on many different levels&rdquo;, says Cary Watters, a member of the Tlingit Tribe and of the park naming committee. &ldquo;The fact that this park's name is a Native [Chinook Wawa] word, and that it honors the traditional way in which our people named places, is a huge step forward in healing - not only for the Native community, but for the land and the at-large community.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Fast Facts on </strong><strong>Luuwit View Park:</strong></p>
<p><em>Features<br /></em>Adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in the Parkrose School District, in the Argay neighborhood of NE Portland. It will feature a playground, grand views, a youth sports field, a full-size basketball court and a teen area. The latter will include a climbing structure, two ping pong tables, a group seating area; and a skate park is under discussion. The entire teen area will be covered, with colorful sports court surfacing. Other features include accessible play and picnic areas, shelters, a restroom, pedestrian and bike paths, parking, community gardens, and a fenced off-leash dog area.</p>
<p><em>Equity/Equal Access<br /></em>The park will serve 965 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 49% of these households are racial and ethnic minorities, and 23% are experiencing poverty.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Funding<br /></em>Project construction cost is estimated at $7.8 million, from <a href=""/parks/38516"">Parks System Development Charges</a> (not General Fund tax dollars).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist - and to expanding other parks - many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, PP&amp;R operating funding has been cut or remained flat, forcing the Bureau to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the City. Despite the 2014 <a href=""/parks/65128"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, passed by voters with overwhelming support, the list of needs across the PP&amp;R system is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. PP&amp;R has anticipated <a href=""/parks/63265"">unfunded maintenance needs</a> totaling nearly $250 million over the next 10 years. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/38516""><strong>System Development Charges</strong></a><strong>, </strong>the funding being used to create the two new parks in east Portland (not General Fund tax dollars) are restricted to expanding capacity only. SDCs cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is also insufficient to fully address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of approximately $472 million over the next ten years.</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area&ldquo;, adds Commissioner Fritz, who designated Luuwit View and Gateway Discovery Parks for development after careful consideration of community input. Commissioner Fritz considered four worthy park options that were ready to build in east Portland &ndash; those with completed Master Plans.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/562260

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will begin erosion control work at the Frank L Knight property (between SW Montgomery and SW Mill St. Terrace) beginning Monday, January 4, 2016. Work is expected to last up to one week, within a window of 7am-5pm. The purpose of this effort is to address the impacts of the recent landslide, plus to make efforts designed to prevent further erosion. The repair work may require the use of heavy equipment, including excavators, dump trucks, and other equipment which is deemed necessary.</p>
<p><strong>How will this affect drivers and neighbors?</strong><br />We are anticipating the use of NW Mill St. Terrace as part of the contractor&rsquo;s staging and work areas for the extent of the repair project. To allow equipment to do work on the narrow Mill St. Terrace, flaggers may be on site to facilitate access and services to the upper part of NW Mill St. Terrace. We hope the job takes 3-5 days, but neighbors and drivers should be prepared for up to a full week of work in this area. Neighbors will be able to access and go to and from their homes, as the work will mostly only require lane closures rather than a full road closure. However, NW Mill St. may experience full closures periodically, up to 20 minutes, to allow for dump truck loading. The Bureau anticipates that a dump truck and trailer may be parked overnight on the shoulder of NW Montgomery, for the duration of the project.</p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong><br />Though the outcomes stated above will have a positive effect on the nearby natural area and the neighborhood, we recognize you may experience some inconvenience during the repair process. Please be prepared for temporary parking, street and sidewalk closures in various places as this work proceeds.</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><br />The Produce for People program (PFP), part of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Community Gardens, announces that Portland Community Gardeners have helped 42,000 pounds of organic, locally grown produce reach 24 hunger relief agencies in Portland. The fresh, nutrititious food was grown in 42 of the 50 Portland Community Garden sites across the Rose City, and harvested during the gardening season spanning November 2014 to October 2015.<br />The Produce for People program first sprouted in 1995 to help neighbors in need. Produce for People allows Portland&rsquo;s community gardeners to use their ability to grow healthy, organic food into an opportunity to fulfill the needs of hungry people in Portland.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;It is uplifting to see this grassroots effort thrive so well,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;PFP is about people helping people, neighbors helping neighbors. I commend all the community gardeners across Portland, as well as our Community Gardens staff, for their continued efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />PFP allows gardeners to cut down on wasting perishable produce they aren&rsquo;t able to immediately consume, and to make new connections with members of their community.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;Our gardeners have so much pride for the food they grow, and love to share the bounty from their gardens with friends, family and people in their community,&rdquo; says Laura Niemi, Portland Community Gardens Program Coordinator.</p>
<p><br />The ability of gardeners to produce a wide variety of vegetables (as well as fresh herbs) is another benefit of the program, as it provides opportunities for access to fresh, culturally appropriate food to members of underprivileged communities.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;And we all need fresh, healthy food, grown as locally as possible,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Produce for People is right in line with our mission for &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;. This is a real community success story.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/558776

<p>The new, air-supported, covered playing surfaces bring the total of indoor courts at the Portland Tennis Center (PTC) to eight.&nbsp; An accessible ramp to the facility has been completed as well, to improve access for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These beautiful indoor courts allow for greater recreational opportunities for everyone,&rdquo; says Parks Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how we achieve our mission of &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;.&nbsp; And with the rainy season coming, it&rsquo;s great to have more indoor play options in our system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The efforts of volunteers and the No Ivy League are essential to the health of our&nbsp;beautiful parks and natural areas,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&nbsp;appreciate the continued engagement of our&nbsp;PP&amp;R staff and our valued community partners to remove this invasive plant&ldquo;.</p>
<p>The non-native English ivy (<em>Hedera hibernica and Hedera helix)</em> is a pervasive and unwelcome guest in our parks and natural areas.&nbsp; The vines overcome native plant species, and mature ivy vines may threaten trees in many of our forests.&nbsp; Ivy removal work parties run from 9:00 AM to 12pm, followed by gatherings for food and celebration from 12:00-1:30 (see above).</p>
<p>The celebration will feature free T-shirts while they last, and a chance to meet with other volunteers.&nbsp; All are welcome to show support for our native ecosystem by joining a volunteer restoration event at one of the many sites throughout the region or by registering to host your own No Ivy Day site.

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation City Nature experts say it is important to remove maturing ivy during the fall to reduce the amount of seed produced through the winter, slowing its spread to unaffected areas.&nbsp; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Terwilliger Wildlands, Marquam Nature Park and Forest Park have seen vast improvements in tree health in places where ivy was recently cleared.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/548973

<p>As originally reported by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation last fall, the canopy over Director Park is in need of maintenance and repair.</p>
<p>R&amp;H Construction, in collaboration with ZGF, KPFF and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, has developed a comprehensive plan to complete the project. Execution of the work is on schedule.&nbsp; The design and permitting is complete.&nbsp; Construction is set to begin on September 23, 2015, and to be completed in early December, 2015.&nbsp; A majority of work will conclude before the holiday street closure moratorium begins.</p>
<p>During construction, Director Park will remain open for use, with the exception of the area directly under and around the canopy, including Elephants Caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>Portland&rsquo;s Park Blocks are some of the oldest parks in the city; they were platted for public use in the late 1840s by Daniel H. Lownsdale and William Williams Chapman. While their original concept to create 25 contiguous public blocks for parks, schools or public markets extending north to south was not fully realized, the existing 18 blocks remain a defining element of our city. As the city developed around them, each block took on its own unique character.</p>
<p>The 19th block, Director Park, was a decade in the making, and was completed in 2009. The iconic downtown public space was made possible through generous donations from the Thomas P. Moyer family and Jordan Director Schnitzer in partnership with the Portland Parks Foundation, as well as funding from the City of Portland and the Portland Development Commission's South Park Blocks Urban Renewal Area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandparents, Simon and Helen Director, were part of a generation of immigrants whose hard work helped build this city,&rdquo; says <em>Jordan Director Schnitzer</em>. &ldquo;Simon Director (1891-1981) was born in the small Russian village of Chartoriysk. He arrived in Portland in 1910 and began work as a butcher. Helen Holtzman (1900-1976) was born in Warsaw, Poland. She arrived in Portland in 1915 and that same year met and married my grandfather. They had three daughters, June, Ruth, and Arlene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simon and Helen Director served their community with distinction, paving the way for their children and grandchildren and for generations to come. This park honors their memory and that of their generation in the hope that those who follow will continue their efforts to make Portland the wonderful city that we call home.&rdquo;&nbsp; <em>~ Jordan Director Schnitzer</em></p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/545353

<p>Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday &amp; Saturday, Oct. 9 &amp; 10, 2015</p>
<p>When:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Times vary by project</p>
<p>Where:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visit the Portland Parks Foundation&rsquo;s <a href=""http://parklandia.org/parkediem"">Parklandia page</a> to see the <em>Parke Diem </em>sites and projects, and to sign up to volunteer.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Portland Parks Foundation (PPF) and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) are pleased to announce the return of <em>Parke Diem</em>: Portland&rsquo;s biggest citywide volunteer work party for the city&rsquo;s beloved parks. More than 1000 volunteers are joining forces at 45 sites &ndash; community gardens, parks, natural areas, and sports fields - across Portland for <em>Parke Diem&rsquo;s </em>third year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation can only do the great work we do because of partnerships with the Foundation, and with our volunteers,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who will once again take part in several <em>Parke Diem </em>events.&nbsp; &ldquo;Parks&rsquo; community gardens staff say that the volunteers at <em>Parke Diem</em> accomplish at least four months of work in just <em>two days</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thank the Portland Parks Foundation for bringing so many volunteers together in one coordinated two day effort.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A half million volunteer hours each year supplement PP&amp;R&rsquo;s dedicated workers with the shared goal of &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;&hellip;for all.&nbsp; <em>Parke</em> <em>Diem</em> is a grass-roots volunteer endeavor to help maintain our City&rsquo;s beloved parks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Parke Diem</em> isn&rsquo;t just about our friends and neighbors getting out to volunteer,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Foundation Board Chair Gina Eiben. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an opportunity for all of us to see the significant needs of the parks that we love so dearly, and to pitch in to make a difference. Portlanders&rsquo; sense of community and generosity is celebrated at <em>Parke Diem</em>&mdash;it highlights our corporate and individual community members&rsquo; ownership of the health of our parks system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neighbors helping neighbors toward our shared goal of Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; <em>&ldquo;Parke Diem </em>is an exciting way to make a real difference in the quality of life in our city,&rdquo; We thank our friends at the Portland Parks Foundation for leading the charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s dozens of community gardens will enjoy numerous <em>Parke Diem</em> work parties.&nbsp; Other exciting <em>Parke Diem</em> projects include the renovation and maintenance of four baseball fields in Pier Park, the building of a set of stairs in Forest Park and the continuation of a project where volunteers will plant 10,000 crocus bulbs in Peninsula Park.</p>
<p><em>Parke Diem</em> is led by a network of community volunteers and park friends groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoyt Arboretum Friends is excited to host <em>Parke Diem</em> for the third year,&rdquo; says Heather Wilkinson, the Volunteer Coordinator of the Hoyt Arboretum Friends group. &ldquo;Each year we bring in over one hundred people, some of whom have never even heard of the Arboretum.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great way to introduce people to this museum of trees as well as getting much needed work accomplished. With 189 acres maintained by a few staff, volunteers are essential to the survival of our 2,000 tree species.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Parke Diem </em>is led by the <a href=""http://www.parklandia.org/"">Portland Parks Foundation</a>, an independent, nonprofit organization formed in 2001, to bring resources for the long-term stewardship of Portland's parks and park programs, and to ensure that they remain publicly supported.&nbsp; The Foundation works hand in hand with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and is committed to building collaborations that strengthen Portland's parks and neighborhoods.&nbsp; <em>Parke Diem</em> is the latest in a long line of initiatives designed to keep our park system among the best in America.</p>

<p>POSTED JULY 16, 2015</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>State Representative <a href=""https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/greenlick"">Mitch Greenlick</a> and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announce that the Oregon Legislature approved $1.5 million in funding towards an official entrance to PP&amp;R&rsquo;s 5,200-acre <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=127"">Forest Park</a>. The entrance, first proposed in the 1995 Forest Park Natural Resource Management Plan, will include a nature center, ADA accessible trail and parking lot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forest Park is a world-class urban treasure,&rdquo; says Rep. Greenlick. &ldquo;The city has been a great steward of the Park for 100 years.&nbsp; This project is the centerpiece of the dream for the next 100 years, keeping the Park alive and accessible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new nature center will be located off Highway 30 and NW Kittridge on a former industrial brownfield adjacent to Forest Park. PP&amp;R finished acquiring the property in 2014, and with support from Metro&rsquo;s voter-approved Parks and Nature program and Parks System Development Charges (<a href=""/parks/38516"">SDCs</a>). The property has since been cleaned up and has DEQ approval for the project to proceed.</p>
<p>The Legislature&rsquo;s significant investment kicks off the next phases of the project, including site planning and design. Upon completion of these phases, the project will be &lsquo;shovel ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The new nature center will have a parking lot big enough for school buses, and will increase field trip opportunities for the region&rsquo;s school children, spurring a lifetime of nature connection and stewardship.&nbsp; The site will also have an ADA-accessible trail with a viewing platform sited to allow great views over the working Willamette River, the St. Johns neighborhood and beyond. Thanks to Legislative leadership, and other generous public and private partnerships that have contributed to this project, opportunities for education and recreation will be available to more Oregonians of all ages and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong>We warmly welcome the state funding for this much anticipated project,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted and thankful that Rep. Greenlick worked so hard to show the Oregon Legislature why they should prioritize an entrance to Forest Park. This proves clearly that our state leaders share our vision, that Forest Park should be more accessible to people of all ages; and one that deserves a nature center, where people from around the globe can learn more about the largest forested urban park in the US.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forest Park is one of the most undiscovered gems in Portland&rsquo;s entire parks system,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;This project will help Forest Park to be more discoverable for all Portlanders.&nbsp; We are building the parks system for the next generation of environmental stewards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project is supplemented by $800,000 in Portland Parks SDC dollars. &nbsp;These are not tax dollars, rather SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of the new development.&nbsp; Park SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Under Armour announce plans to move forward with a significant partnership to enhance recreational opportunities for Portlanders.</p>
<p>The athletic apparel and footwear leader and PP&amp;R will team up to enhance athletic facilities within the PP&amp;R system, likely at east Portland&rsquo;s Lents Park, and at Duniway Park in the southwest part of the city, though project details are being finalized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great neighborhood parks are part of what makes Portland such a fantastic place,&rdquo; said Portland Mayor Charlie Hales.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the participation of Under Armour, with its philanthropic contributions, fits perfectly with the values of our community. We&rsquo;re excited about working with this great company now and in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute; has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that details Under Armour and PP&amp;R&rsquo;s joint goals for enhancing athletic facilities and towards supporting the Portland community.&nbsp; Under Armour&rsquo;s focus is consistent with PP&amp;R&rsquo;s values of equity and for the improved health and quality of life of all Portlanders.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation cares for more than 11,650 acres of land on more than 200 parks and natural areas, representing about 12% of the geographical area within the City of Portland. Not included in this acreage are approximately 238,000 street trees cared for by PP&amp;R staff. The bureau operates 13 swimming pools, 15 community and arts centers, five golf courses, and one motor sports raceway.&nbsp; Portland&rsquo;s parks, public places, natural areas and recreational opportunities give life and beauty to our city. These essential assets connect people to place, self and others.&nbsp; Facing the major maintenance needs of an aging system (estimated at more than $200 million, currently unfunded, over the next 10 years) and more than $400 million, currently unfunded, in growth needs to meet population and density demands over the next 10 years, the community need still exceeds available resources.&nbsp; Public/private partnerships are a key component of helping the Bureau meet the needs of Portlanders and all park visitors.</p>

2015,534821,"Portland Parks & Recreation and partners to provide 111,000 free, healthy lunches to children this summer",2,,2015-06-18 23:21:25 UTC,2015-06-18 23:19:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>The end of the school year should be a time for fun, relaxation, and exploration for children. However, that&rsquo;s not the case for thousands of kids here in the metro area and millions nationwide.&nbsp; <strong>57 percent</strong> of Portland-area children qualify for free and reduced-price meals during the school year.&nbsp; To fill the summertime meal gap, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) joins forces with Partners for a Hunger-free Oregon (PHFO), Bank of America, local school districts and other partners and local businesses to present the <a href=""/parks/article/489143"">Summer Free For All Summer Playgrounds and Free Lunches program</a>.&nbsp; The goal is to reduce what&rsquo;s known as <a href=""https://oregonhunger.org/hunger-rates"">food insecurity</a>.&nbsp; The partners have distributed <strong><em>half a million</em></strong> free meals over the last five summers.&nbsp; For the summer of 2015, PP&amp;R and its partners expect to serve around 111,000 free lunches, and to also provide supervised games and playground activities.</p>
<p><strong>Partnerships are key</strong></p>
<p>Combining efforts means more children will get the healthy lunches they need.&nbsp; PP&amp;R teams up with Partners for a Hunger-Free Oregon (PHFO), Bank of America, Wal-Mart, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the National Recreation and Park Association, the non-profit Portland Parks Foundation and local school districts to help fill the crucial summer meal gap with free, healthy lunches at sites across the city.&nbsp; The need is there, even if it&rsquo;s not always evident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunger is typically not a visible problem, unless you know somebody who&rsquo;s experiencing it,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many of our neighbors continue to consume <em>meals</em>, but not <em>nutrients.</em>&nbsp; So today we see the faces of American hunger as a single mother forced to skip a meal, as children who don&rsquo;t get the needed nutrients for learning and growing, and as obesity and its accompanying spectrum of physical ailments.&rdquo; <em>(See attachment regarding the science behind hunger)</em></p>
<p>It may come as a surprise that such a large effort is needed to keep kids fed in the summer.&nbsp; But food insecurity is all across the region, according to the experts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunger looks different here than it does in many famine-struck countries. Children are not starving, but often the calories they have access to don&rsquo;t provide the nutrients they need,&rdquo; says Annie Kirschner, PHFO.</p>
<p>Andrea Anderson teaches fourth and fifth grade and observes the threat of hunger in her classrooms. ""The difference between the haves and the have-nots is most clear in the month of May at a Title 1 school,&rdquo; Anderson says. &ldquo;Children just fall apart this time of year. It is not summer vacation for many of them; summer brings worry, and fear, and hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anderson attests that an easily accessible summer meal program that provides consistent and healthy meals can make a huge difference in the kids&rsquo; outlook about summer. &ldquo;Not only do their brains and bodies need it, but also when food is in the equation, they get to be like any other kid&hellip; Plus it gets them to try new healthy foods.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The business community is stepping up</strong></p>
<p><em>When you want to go fast, go alone.&nbsp; When you want to go far, go together.</em>--African proverb</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Playgrounds and Free Lunches program is a success story of the power of teamwork.&nbsp; The support of the business community is vital so that PP&amp;R and its partners can provide a high level of life-enhancing lunch services to the Portland community.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bank of America is a leader around the issue of hunger in Oregon, dedicating thousands of volunteer hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars to help community members in need. For the second year in a row, they are the lead financial supporter of the Summer Lunches program, helping to underwrite this important program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunger is a critical need that we need to address to ensure kids have the foundation for successful learning,&rdquo; says Roger Hinshaw, Bank of America President for Oregon and southwest Washington. &ldquo;As a sponsor of Summer Lunches and other programs to combat food insecurity in our community, we&rsquo;re working to encourage other corporate partners to support hunger relief efforts in Multnomah County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hinshaw notes that the investment in summer lunches goes beyond just the summer. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s kids are the future of our community. It&rsquo;s our responsibility as community leaders to give back to ensure Portland&rsquo;s success for generations to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Families have to know, to go</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R and PHFO have found that a lack of awareness among parents about summer lunch programs is one of the biggest reasons that some families do not participate. To find a local site, including the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Summer Free For All Summer Lunches sites and dates, families can go to <a href=""http://www.summerfoodoregon.org"">www.summerfoodoregon.org</a>.&nbsp; Partners for a Hunger-Free Oregon works with hundreds of meal programs across the state, like those run by PP&amp;R, to help make sure families know where and when meals are served, and that they are open to all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all want to live in an Oregon where kids' talents are nurtured, their health is protected, and they have a strong foundation for launching their dreams,&rdquo; says PHFO&rsquo;s Kirschner. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what this partnership is all about.&rdquo;</p>

2015,534349,"Commissioner Fritz, Portland Parks & Recreation propose amendment to smoke and tobacco-free policy",2,,2018-08-02 18:09:51 UTC,2015-06-15 23:06:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s ban on smoking and tobacco use will expand to include the entire PP&amp;R system on July 1, 2015.&nbsp; All City parks, natural areas, community centers, trails, golf courses, recreation areas, and all other sites where PP&amp;R park rules apply will be smoke and tobacco-free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bureau continues to feel that education on this expanded policy is the best way to promote public health and protect Portland&rsquo;s parks and natural areas.&nbsp; PP&amp;R currently prohibits tobacco use at Director Park, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and the portion of the South Park Blocks that is located on Portland State University&rsquo;s campus. Smoking is also prohibited within 25 feet of any play structure, picnic table or designated children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expanding the smoking and tobacco-free policy throughout the entire PP&amp;R system makes the rule consistent,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Portland will join more than 500 cities and towns nationwide which already have laws mandating smoke-free parks.&nbsp; It furthers our mission of Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, June 17, 2015, prior to the expanded policy going into effect, Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz is taking an amendment to City Council clarifying how the policy will be enforced: only by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff who have the authority to enforce park rules (such as Portland Park Rangers), and not law enforcement or other personnel.&nbsp; Those smoking or using tobacco could be asked to leave the park where the violation takes place, for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intent of the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy is to promote public health and protect Portland&rsquo;s parks and natural areas, not to criminalize those who smoke or use tobacco,&rdquo; says Commissioner Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;We expect people to comply with the expanded policy because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do for our parks and for themselves, not solely because they&rsquo;re faced with major penalties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The primary method of enforcement will be education, emphasized Fritz.&nbsp; Voluntary compliance is key in the expanded policy, which is designed to promote public health and to protect Portland&rsquo;s parks and natural areas from litter and fire danger, among other concerns.</p>
<p>Prohibited smoking and tobacco products include, but are not limited to: bidis, cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, clove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine vaporizers, nicotine liquids, hookahs, kreteks, pipes, chew, snuff, smokeless tobacco, and marijuana.&nbsp; The expanded policy will also apply to events held at PP&amp;R properties, with a provision for golf tournaments to allow smoking under permitted and certain conditions.</p>

2015,534154,Portland Parks & Recreation Dedicates new Marshall Park Playground,2,,2015-06-12 23:17:02 UTC,2015-06-12 23:16:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;<strong>Marshall Park Neighborhood Association and other partners welcome all to celebration Saturday, June 13</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Marshall Park Neighborhood Association (MPNA) will hold a free community celebration to dedicate the new playground at southwest Portland&rsquo;s Marshall Park.&nbsp; City leaders, partners and neighbors will gather on Saturday, June 13 from 11am-1pm.</p>
<p>The playground at Marshall Park (9200 SW 12<sup>th</sup> Drive) opened for use on January 23, 2015.&nbsp; It immediately became a valued and extensively used community asset.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT: Marshall Park playground dedication and community celebration</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN: Saturday, June 13, 11am-1pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE: Marshall Park.&nbsp; Take Taylor&rsquo;s Ferry Ct., then first right onto SW 12<sup>th</sup> Drive.</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) thanks the Friends of Marshall and Maricara Parks and the Marshall Park Neighborhood Association for their continued efforts and partnership.&nbsp; The playground replacement was made possible by a grant from Oregon Parks &amp; Recreation Department&ndash; Local Government Grants (State Parks) and System Development Charges, or SDCs.&nbsp;SDCs are one-time fees on new development to provide funding for the City to meet the infrastructure needs created by growth.&nbsp; Additional funds were supplied by the SWNI (Southwest Neighborhoods, Inc.) neighborhood grant program, and donated services by Rob Lennox, Bluedot group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the volunteers who helped in the fundraising and advocacy for this playground grew up playing there,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;They played on the old equipment that had to be removed for safety reasons several years ago.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very gratifying to have this sparkling new playground for current and future generations to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notable guests at the playground dedication include Commissioner Amanda Fritz, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, OPRD Deputy Director MG Devereux, John DeLance of Friends of Marshall Park and Amy Steingrebe of the Marshall Park Neighborhood Association.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our staff and contractors take great pride in the work they do,&rdquo; adds Director Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;They put safety first, but in conjunction with a world-class recreation experience.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s delightful to see the many children and parents enjoying the new Marshall Park playground so much, and I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the formal dedication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marshall Park general contractor was Duke Construction &amp; Excavation, LLC from Damascus, Oregon.&nbsp; The environmental exploration area was created by PP&amp;R&rsquo;s City Nature staff. &nbsp;Greenworks, PC did design work and construction drawings.</p>

2015,533342,Portland Parks & Recreation acquires nearly 3 acres of parkland in St Johns,2,,2015-06-09 16:24:52 UTC,2015-06-09 16:18:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has finalized the purchase of nearly three acres of land adjacent to 7654 N. Crawford in north Portland. The site is currently known as the N Crawford St and N Polk Ave property. City Council had previously approved the purchase, and the deal was completed on May 29, 2015. It is now open for public use for picnics, reading, relaxing and other passive activities. The property provides access to 798 households; including 477 households not currently served by another park within a half mile.</p>
<p>The PP&amp;R process for formally naming the St. Johns-area park will take place once the site has a Master Plan, which is yet to be determined. The land contains two Heritage Trees of Portland, both Oregon white oaks (Quercus garryana).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The St. John&rsquo;s Community has experienced considerable residential growth over the past few years,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz&ldquo;. &ldquo;The opportunity to purchase the N Crawford St and N Polk Ave property with Parks System Development Charge revenue provided a way to increase the parkland in the area to help mitigate the impact of that growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will maintain the property for passive recreational use by mowing, pruning, and trash clean-up, but the bureau won&rsquo;t be making any big changes at this point. When resources permit, the property will undergo a Master Plan to determine its use, features, and future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The addition of this significant north Portland property to PP&amp;R&rsquo;s inventory provides the public with another opportunity for recreation,&rdquo; say PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And a chance to enjoy two Heritage Trees as well as the views of the West Hills and Willamette River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A home adjacent to the property is separate from the land PP&amp;R acquired, and is for sale by its owner.</p>
<p>N Crawford St and N Polk Ave property facts</p>
<p>Acreage: 2.92 acres</p>
<p>Purchase Price: $880,000</p>
<p>Funding Source: Parks System Development Charges (SDCs). SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Park SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.</p>

2015,532724,"Portland Parks & Recreation’s Community Music Center welcomes all to take part in huge performance of ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star""",2,,2015-06-02 20:25:52 UTC,2015-06-02 20:23:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Community Music Center (CMC) presents a free special event: &ldquo;Galactic Twinkle&rdquo;, a giant audience participation performance of &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&rdquo;, as part of CMC&rsquo;s 60th anniversary celebration. The event takes place Sunday afternoon, June 7, 2015, at Reed College. Multnomah County Commissioner Jules Bailey will lead the ensemble of ""twinklers"". CMC expects more than 100 children and adults to participate, mostly on violin, but anyone age 4 or older may bring an instrument, play along and be a 'star'.</p>
<p>What: Galactic Twinkle, part of Community Music Center&rsquo;s 60th Anniversary Performance Festival &amp; Community Event<br />Where: Reed College Kaul Auditorium, SE 28th Ave &amp; Woodstock St, in Portland. Other events in the Reed Performing Arts Complex, and Chapel. Free event parking in any of Reed&rsquo;s three lots on campus.<br />When: Sunday, June 7, 2015; The Galactic Twinkle takes place at the end of the 2 pm free concert (likely between 3:00 and 3:30 pm). All are welcome to the performance festival. running 1pm to 9pm.<br />Cost: Free, with suggested donation of $10 to benefit CMC.<br />Notes: No advance registration is required to participate, however seating may be limited, so early arrival is advised. Auditorium doors open at 1:30 pm, open seating. Media: please check in at the Kaul Auditorium lobby welcome table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Music unites all people and all Portlanders,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;The Community Music Center is a beloved part of the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation system. We expect CMC will continue striking a chord with the community for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the Event<br />The Galactic Twinkle is part of a day-long event that celebrates 60 years of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation music education with a performance festival and community event. More than 300 students, instructors, and CMC alumni perform for the public in seven inspiring concerts throughout the day on Sunday, June 7, 2015.</p>
<p>The event is to thank the community for 60 years of support for Community Music Center and its programs, to demonstrate the breadth and depth of services provided by CMC, and to raise funds that provide equity of access to quality music instruction programs for all ages. It is made possible by the Wintz Family Foundation and sponsored by local area businesses, so that all net proceeds benefit the Community Music Center&rsquo;s music scholarship program for students in need.</p>
<p>About Jules Bailey<br />Multnomah County Commissioner Jules Bailey is an alumnus of PP&amp;R's Community Music Center, taking violin lessons there as a child. CMC asked him to participate as a role model for the young students at the event, to show that the study of music is an important part of a well-rounded education whether one's career path leads to music, public service, or other fields.</p>
<p>Why Twinkle?<br />The June 7th ""Galactic Twinkle"" event is intended to demonstrate the universal value of music education, and may establish a record for number of people playing &ldquo;Twinkle&rdquo; at one time. The melody for ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&rdquo; is used in music education because it is so widely known to young children (it shares the same melody with ""Bah, Bah, Black Sheep"" and the ""ABC Song""). Dr. Sinichi Suzuki created the Suzuki method that has every beginning student play the tune in several variations.</p>
<p>What is the record for largest Twinkle performance?<br />The Suzuki Association of the Americas has no record yet for the largest performance of ""Twinkle"" in Oregon, so the June 7 event will definitely set the bar for them. The Guinness Book of Records does not keep records of individual song participation numbers. According to Guinness, the largest violin ensemble featured 4,645 participants and was achieved by the Changhua County Government (Chinese Taipei) at Changhua Stadium, Chinese Taipei, on 17th of September, 2011. While the June 7 Galactic Twinkle event will probably not make the Guinness Book, it will surely be an impressive assembly worthy of capturing in photos and videos. Basically, you are going to want to Tweet this!</p>
<p>Who wrote Twinkle?<br />According to Wikipedia: ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" lyrics are from an early 19th-century English poem by Jane Taylor, ""The Star"". It is sung to the tune of the French melody Ah! vous dirai-je, maman, which was published in 1761 and later arranged by several composers including Mozart with Twelve Variations on ""Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"".</p>

2015,532400,Portland Parks & Recreation Dedicates New Futsal Court at Colonel Summers Park,2,,2015-05-29 22:36:16 UTC,2015-05-29 22:35:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>Operation Pitch Invasion volunteer effort pays off for neighborhood</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), <a href=""http://www.pitch-invasion.org/"" target=""_blank"">Operation Pitch Invasion</a> (OPI) and the <a href=""http://parklandia.org/"" target=""_blank"">Portland Parks Foundation</a> will dedicate the new Colonel Summers Park futsal court on Saturday, May 30, 2015, with a free celebration, snacks, and informal games.</p>
<p>The futsal court is entirely the result of an impressive OPI volunteer effort to enhance the park, located at SE 17<sup>th</sup> and Taylor.&nbsp; Futsal is a version of soccer played on a smaller scale, and the park is an excellent location for this added recreational amenity.&nbsp; The Portland Parks Foundation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://parklandia.org/parkediem"" target=""_blank""><em>Parke Diem</em></a>, the city&rsquo;s largest annual parks-related volunteer effort, inspired OPI&rsquo;s idea to build the futsal court.</p>
<p><strong>What: </strong>Dedication of the Colonel Summers Park futsal court</p>
<p><strong>When: </strong>Saturday, May 30, 11am-1pm.&nbsp; All are welcome<strong> </strong>to the free celebration<strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong> Where: </strong>Colonel Summers Park, SE 20<sup>th</sup> Ave. &amp; Belmont.&nbsp; Guests include Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, and OPI&rsquo;s Shawn Levy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dedicated volunteers of Operation Pitch Invasion are a key part of why our city has such a high quality of life,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation can only do so much by ourselves.&nbsp; But when you add in nearly half a million volunteer hours a year, the possibilities are amazing &ndash; and evident, as with this court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""I&rsquo;m so very thankful for OPI&rsquo;s passion and efforts in bringing a new park amenity for neighbors to enjoy for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2013, PP&amp;R planning, management and construction staff looked to see what changes (physical and otherwise) the bureau could make to the park, in response to underage drinking and loud unpermitted gatherings taking place there.&nbsp; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation removed damaged benches and picnic tables, trimmed up bushes and trees, and conducted a neighborhood park clean-up.&nbsp; A group of neighborhood volunteers repainted structures, and the City bolstered the presence of Park Rangers and police &ndash; make it clear that illegal activity will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation recognizes that increasing positive uses is an excellent strategy to reduce inappropriate activity,&rdquo; notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;And most fortunately, <a href=""http://www.pitch-invasion.org/"" target=""_blank"">Operation Pitch Invasion</a> was looking for volunteer opportunities they could undertake in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OPI and PP&amp;R built on their partnership, and with the support of the Portland Parks Foundation and <a href=""http://www.buckmanpdx.org/"" target=""_blank"">Buckman Community Association</a> &ndash; the Colonel Summers Park futsal court was proposed and completed. PP&amp;R and the Portland Parks Foundation provided staff support, OPI paid for the work and materials (with help from a grant provided by the Portland Parks Foundation), and a new, welcome neighborhood amenity came to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Operation Pitch Invasion is dedicated to improving and maintaining the existing soccer facilities in the Portland area and in adding to the inventory of quality surfaces for the beautiful game,&rdquo; say OPI&rsquo;s Shawn Levy.&nbsp; &ldquo;A futsal court like the one at Colonel Summers Park brings a healthy, safe, fun, and inclusive sport into a park without significant cost, construction effort, or impact on the surroundings.&nbsp; We feel fortunate that, working with our friends at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, we found just the right spot for the project, and we're extremely gratified to see the use it's already getting from both kids and adults.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole impetus behind this project was the Foundation&rsquo;s <em>Parke Diem</em> event,&rdquo; adds OPI&rsquo;s Josh Barrett.&nbsp; &ldquo;OPI wanted to transform this space and <em>Parke Diem</em>&nbsp;was sort of a triggering event that seemed to give the project some momentum.&rdquo;</p>

2015,532008,Portland Parks & Recreation to Adopt More Equitable Fee Structure for System Development Charges,2,,2015-05-27 23:10:01 UTC,2015-05-27 23:09:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>One-time fees from new development to pay for parks and recreation infrastructure</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Portland City Council voted today to approve a new methodology for how Portland Parks &amp; Recreation calculates System Development Charges (SDCs).&nbsp; SDCs are one-time fees on new development to provide funding for the City to meet the infrastructure needs created by growth.&nbsp; The changes that Council approved more equitably distribute the responsibility for meeting those needs between new residential and non-residential development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The changes will go into effect on July 1, 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;These Parks SDC changes are for new development.&nbsp; They do not impact existing homes,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &rdquo;They provide for a more equitable collection of Parks SDCs which will help ensure that money will be available to provide needed parks and recreation facilities to serve Portland&rsquo;s growing community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parks SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development.&nbsp; They cover a portion of the cost of providing new parks, trails, natural areas and other recreational facilities to keep pace with a growing city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is about the future of Portland&rsquo;s parks,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp; &ldquo;100 years from now, our children&rsquo;s children will be thankful we had the foresight to guarantee their opportunities for vitality, health, and recreation.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;People move to Portland because of our quality of life, and our parks are a big part of that,&rdquo; Fritz added. &ldquo;We have to make sure that our infrastructure keeps pace with that of development.&nbsp; This is a fiscally responsible measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) reviews and updates its SDC methodology every five years.&nbsp; Council decided to delay the changes it adopted today until July 2016, as a way to ensure existing development&nbsp;projects in the pipeline are not affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to her &ldquo;aye&rdquo; vote, Fritz added, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve listened to all the testimony and considered all the amendment requests.&nbsp; New development should pay its way.&nbsp; No more, no less.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposal provides a more equitable distribution of the impact and fees charged. In addition, the new methodology will now charge new businesses in the non-central city for employees&rsquo; impact on neighborhood parks. This is currently the case in the central city, but was&nbsp;not&nbsp;previously done for non-central city commercial development using the 2008 methodology.</p>

<p><strong>FOR THE MOST UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON SHUTTLE SERVICE IN WASHINGTON PARK, PLEASE </strong><strong>VISIT <a href=""http://WWW.EXPLOREWASHINGTONPARK.ORG"">WWW.EXPLOREWASHINGTONPARK.ORG</a></strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><strong><em>Free park-wide shuttle and customer service staff help visitors explore Washington Park</em></strong></p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s amazing Washington Park has a new, FREE park-wide shuttle starting operation 7-days-a-week on Memorial Day weekend.&nbsp; The shuttle reduces car trips to and around the park by allowing visitors to park once - &nbsp;or to take TriMet/MAX - and then explore the entire park by hopping on and off at any of the nine stops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Washington Park Free Shuttle started running on weekends during the first week in May, 2015 and welcomed more than 2,600 riders over just three weekends. The free service now expands from weekends only to everyday summer service on Saturday, May 23.</p>
<p>The shuttle consists of 2015 model-year buses, each with capacity for 24 passengers.&nbsp; Each bus is ADA-accessible and runs continuous loops inside the park.&nbsp; The free shuttle has nine designated stops (see attachment) and runs every day, seven days a week, from 9am to 6pm.&nbsp; The free Washington Park shuttle arrives approximately every 15 minutes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The daily free shuttle is an amazing addition to the park, and allows visitors to explore this beautiful place without having to worry about driving or re-parking to get from one venue to another,&rdquo; says Ruth Shelly, Executive Director of Portland Children's Museum and Chair of the <a href=""http://washingtonparkpdx.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WashingtonPark-TMA-ShuttleStopBoard-FINAL-1.pdf"">Washington Park Transportation Management Association</a> (TMA) Board of Directors.&nbsp; &ldquo;This service fulfills a promise we made to the public to provide a free park-wide shuttle and is a huge step in improving public access to the park, reducing congestion, and lessening environmental impact.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More than three million people visit Washington Park each year.&nbsp; The free park shuttle will help guests access all the park&rsquo;s magnificent attractions while reducing the amount of time they spend moving or riding in a car.</p>
<p>The free shuttle stops at nine sites, including world-renowned park attractions such as the International Rose Test Garden, Portland Japanese Garden, Hoyt Arboretum Visitors Center, and the Washington Park MAX station where guest can access the Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, Oregon Zoo, and World Forestry Center. Other stops include the Vietnam and Holocaust memorials, the huge children&rsquo;s playground, and the archery range.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 minutes on the shuttle to get from one end of the park to the other and about 30 minutes to ride the entire loop.&nbsp; Park visitors can look for the &ldquo;Free Washington Park Shuttle signs&rdquo; located at the park&rsquo;s major attractions.</p>
<p>In addition to the seven-day-a-week free shuttle within Washington Park, the TMA operates a free shuttle to and from the park&rsquo;s overflow parking lots.&nbsp; On the most popular summer days, even these overflow parking lots can fill quickly and park guests are encouraged to take public transit.</p>
<p>The TMA also provides Washington Park Customer Service Staff at information kiosks located at the Washington Park MAX station and the Rose Garden plaza.&nbsp; Staff will be in the park daily from 9:00 am to 5:00 p.m. starting June 3 and will provide information on park attractions and how to use the Washington Park shuttle.&nbsp; TMA Customer Service staff had over 17,000 conversations during the 2014 season and provided over 10,000 Washington Park maps.</p>
<p>The Washington Park free shuttle and the customer service staff are all a part of the TMA&rsquo;s efforts to improve access to, and within, Portland&rsquo;s most visited park. These efforts are paid for entirely from Washington Park parking revenue, 100% of which is used for transportation and parking-related projects in and around Washington Park.</p>

<p><br />All are welcome to the grand opening celebration of K&#688;unamokwst Park, the newest Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) park and the first developed park in the diverse Cully neighborhood. City leaders including Mayor Charlie Hales and Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz will join neighbors and other stakeholders who made K&#688;unamokwst Park a reality. The 2.4 acre park at NE 52nd Ave. and Alberta is the first PP&amp;R park to enjoy a name indigenous to the land it sits on. K&#688;unamokwst Park first opened to the public on Friday, April 24, and was made possible in part by funding from Metro&rsquo;s voter-approved 2006 bond.</p>
<p>The name (pronounced KAHN-ah-mockst), is a Chinook wawa name meaning &ldquo;together&rdquo;. Hear the pronunciation on the attached wave file.</p>
<p>Grand opening is Saturday, May 16, 11am-3pm.</p>
<p>Grand opening activities include:<br />&bull; Native American dancers, drummers, and blessing of the land<br />&bull; Grilled food<br />&bull; Raffle<br />&bull; Live music<br />&bull; Park Rangers lead kids in a pledge to become Junior Rangers<br />&bull; Scavenger hunt with prizes<br />&bull; Puppet parade</p>

<p>&ldquo;K&#688;unamokwst Park brings us one step closer to bringing the kind of access to parks that our Cully neighbors deserve,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The name invokes a sense of community and unity; our values of inclusion, equity, and fun for all ages. And looking at this beautiful new park, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine generations of Portlanders having fun together here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fritz adds that she has been proud to continue former Parks Commissioner Nick Fish&rsquo;s work to provide the newest neighborhood park in a park-deficient area, one built with strong community support and extensive neighborhood involvement. &nbsp;The K&#688;unamokwst project cost is approx. $2.5 million, paid for via SDCs (System Development Charges). SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The new Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) park <strong>serves 1488 families</strong> who until very recently did not have ready access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Native American Community Advisory Council welcomed Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s invitation to help name K&#688;unamokwst Park, along with the Cully neighbors,&rdquo; says Katy Holland of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. &ldquo;We feel our ancestors would be honored to have this name chosen for the park which acknowledges the indigenous peoples of this surrounding area. &ldquo;</p>

<p>&bull; A traditional children&rsquo;s&rsquo; playground AND<br />&bull; An innovative &ldquo;nature play&rdquo; area with boulders to climb on, a slide on a hillside<br />&bull; Water feature &ndash; an interactive water play area<br />&bull; Paths for walking and jogging<br />&bull; Native plants<br />&bull; A large open lawn<br />&bull; Picnic tables<br />&bull; Picnic shelter with an &ldquo;eco-roof&rdquo;, a planted roof which reduces stormwater runoff into city infrastructure and provides for increased sustainability&hellip;<br />&bull; Park benches<br />&bull; Portland Loo (restroom)<br />&bull; Skate dot &ndash; small skateboard park with kids and beginners in mind<br />&bull; Lights<br />&bull; On-street parking<br />&bull; New sidewalks and street improvements (thanks to the Portland Bureau of Transportation)<br />&bull; Rain garden &ndash; where rain water drains</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s South Waterfront Greenway Central District project is complete, and opened to the public this morning (Thursday, May 14, 2015). The Greenway pairs a city park and valuable transportation corridor with wildlife habitat along the river&rsquo;s edge - all on land reclaimed from industrial use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The South Waterfront Greenway Central District improves the quality of life for neighbors, commuters and visitors,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;It increases access to and within downtown and southwest Portland, and the South Waterfront neighborhood- which will be one of the densest in the state when it&rsquo;s fully built out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The park features five river overlooks with benches, a variety of permanent lawn chairs and benches also with river views, extensive lawn areas, public art, and nearly a quarter mile of bike and running/walking trails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognize the importance of parks, transportation, and regional partnership in building a neighborhood,&rdquo; said PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why PDC invested $4 million in this project when the South Waterfront was in its earliest stages of development. I&rsquo;m delighted to see the Greenway join PDC-funded Caruthers Park as another stellar South Waterfront open-space amenity for Portlanders.&rdquo;<br />The site is a brownfield redevelopment that is enrolled in the State of Oregon&rsquo;s Voluntary Cleanup Program. The City used clean materials on top of the remains of past industrial activities such as sawmills, ship building and breaking facilities, a concrete plant and various dump sites. More than 32,000 tons of contaminated soil and debris were removed and disposed of in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>A grand opening celebration for the South Waterfront Greenway &ndash; Central District (the buy-a-vowel acronym is SWGCD) is planned for Saturday, June 27 &ndash; 10am-2pm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TriMet was pleased to partner with the City to enhance the livability of this neighborhood and improve fish habitat, as we built the MAX Orange Line and the Tilikum Crossing, Bridge of the People,&rdquo; said TriMet General Manager Neil McFarlane. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great benefit for the entire community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PDC contributed $4 million toward the project via Urban Renewal funding (via the North Macadam URA). TriMet provided the project a grant of $1.42 million, and the Bureau of Environment Services added $750,000. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation funding, including $9.261 million from Parks&rsquo; System Development Charges (SDCs), covered the majority of the project cost. SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the costs of providing certain types of public capital facilities to address impact created by new development.</p>
<p>The Central District project is the first of three South Waterfront Greenway (SWG) segments to be completed. The SWG North and South segments are in the planning stages.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation takes its responsibility to reconnect Portlanders with their river very seriously. Project designers placed trees so that view corridors to the river are preserved at each overlook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portlanders need to be close to their river, and they need places to play,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Salmon need shallow water for habitat, to escape from larger predator fish. The Greenway delivers all of that, and it is a critical piece of a bike route along the river between the Sellwood Bridge and Downtown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salmon habitat and more<br />At the bottom of the restored riverbank, 25,500 square foot of rocky, shallow water habitat has been created so that juvenile salmon can take refuge from larger predator fish. An innovative series of retaining walls carves out the space for the shallow water habitat while supporting the park on top, at the same time providing beds on the riverbank for the habitat plantings. Project planners called for installation of a variety of native trees and shrubs, such as are found in nearby intact habitats, to provide riparian habitat in support of the fish.</p>
<p>The upland park contains the full range of amenities usual in an urban park: a variety of seating types, lighting, public art, trees and plantings, plus five river overlooks, one at the foot of each street that meets the park (Gibbs, Whitaker, Curry, Pennoyer and Gaines). The trees are placed so that view corridors to the river are preserved at each overlook, and vary elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is also a tall Osprey Nest Pole standing near the Gibbs Street Overlook, a gift from the South Waterfront Community. The South Waterfront neighborhood is expected to be the densest in the state when fully built-out. When all three of its districts are complete, the South Waterfront Greenway will link Downtown with the Sellwood Bridge. The riverbank reconstruction supports endangered fish, while the upland park will provide recreational opportunities for all of those residents, guests and workers. The South Waterfront Greenway &ndash; Central District has set the bar for riverbank park development within the City of Portland.</p>
<p>South Waterfront Greenway &ndash; Central District by the numbers</p>
<p>&bull; Riverbank restoration: 1,050 feet in length<br />&bull; Park: 1,250 feet in length<br />&bull; Total budget: $15,498,100 in funding<br />&bull; Funders: Portland Development Commission (PDC, via North Macadam Urban Renewal Area), TriMet, Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), Portland Parks &amp; Recreation System Development Charges (SDCs)<br />&bull; RACC 2% for public art: &ldquo;Cradle&rdquo; by Buster Simpson, with Peg Butler. RACC is working on a second, interpretive art piece addressing Native American themes. No artist selected yet.</p>

2015,528287,National recognition for restoring Portland’s Crystal Springs Creek in Westmoreland Park,2,,2015-04-24 23:18:32 UTC,2015-04-24 23:18:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland) -</p>
<p>The American Planning Association (APA) has given significant recognition to the joint effort restoring Crystal Springs Creek in Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Westmoreland Park. This week, the APA honored the Crystal Springs Restoration Project as the nation&rsquo;s most sustainable parks and open space restoration project, via the group&rsquo;s prestigious 2015 Excellence in Sustainability Award.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Environmental Services, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other partners finished work last fall to restore Crystal Springs Creek in the park and improve access to trails and the creek. The park&rsquo;s restored duck pond has a more natural stream channel with pools and riffles to improve fish habitat. Native trees and shrubs planted on the bank shade and cool the water and provide wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>The project included adding a boardwalk and overlooks, seating, paths, lighting, and picnic areas. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation renovated the play area as a separate pilot project for its Nature-Based Play Initiative to create settings in developed parks that encourage creative play and interaction with natural features. The Westmoreland Nature Play Area was supported with funding from Metro&rsquo;s voter-approved 2006 natural areas bond measure (Nature in Neighborhoods).</p>
<p>The APA sustainability award recognizes the work the city, its many community partners and other agencies are doing to bring nature into our communities, restore salmon habitat in the city and improve our parks.&emsp;<br />&ldquo;This award is the result of governments working together to improve Portlanders&rsquo; quality of life,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Thanks to the many community partners and other agencies who have worked so hard to bring nature back into the neighborhood. The park looks amazing and the wildlife habitat has benefits that are far-reaching and long-lasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project was a critical part of successful efforts to remove barriers that kept salmon from reaching the best salmon habitat in the city,&rdquo; says City Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;Now, for the first time in 40 years, we are seeing salmon return to those areas to spawn.&rdquo;</p>

2015,528056,"Newest Portland park, Kʰunamokwst Park, Opens on Friday, April 24",2,,2015-04-23 23:31:40 UTC,2015-04-23 23:30:00 UTC,A,,"<p><br /><em>First Developed Park in Cully Neighborhood; Grand Opening Celebration open to all on May 16</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>K&#688;unamokwst Park, the newest Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) park and the first developed park in the diverse Cully neighborhood, will open on Friday, April 24. The 2.4 acre park at NE 52nd Ave. and Alberta will be the first PP&amp;R park to enjoy a name indigenous to the land it sits on. K&#688;unamokwst (pronounced KAHN-ah-mockst) is a Chinook wawa name meaning &ldquo;together&rdquo;. Hear the pronunciation on the attached wave file.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opening K&#688;unamokwst Park brings us one step closer to bringing the kind of access to parks that our Cully neighbors deserve,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The name invokes a sense of community and unity; our values of inclusion, equity, and fun for all ages. And looking at this beautiful new park, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine generations of Portlanders having fun together here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) park will serve 1488 families who currently do not have ready access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Native American Community Advisory Council welcomed Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s invitation to help name K&#688;unamokwst Park, along with the Cully neighbors,&rdquo; says Katy Holland of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians. &ldquo;We feel our ancestors would be honored to have this name chosen for the park which acknowledges the indigenous peoples of this surrounding area. &ldquo;</p>
<p>All are welcome to the Khunamokwst Park Grand Opening Celebration, a community celebration on Saturday, May 16, from 11am-3pm featuring members of the Cully Association of Neighbors (CAN), Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, and other valued guests.</p>
<p>K&#688;unamokwst Park features include:</p>
<p>A traditional children&rsquo;s&rsquo; playground AND<br />An innovative &ldquo;nature play&rdquo; area with boulders to climb on, a slide on a hillside<br />Water feature &ndash; an interactive water play area<br />Paths for walking and jogging<br />Native plants<br />A large open lawn<br />Picnic tables<br />Picnic shelter with an &ldquo;eco-roof&rdquo;, a planted roof which reduces stormwater runoff into city infrastructure and provides for increased sustainability&hellip;<br />Park benches<br />Portland Loo (restroom)<br />Skate dot &ndash; small skateboard park with kids and beginners in mind<br />Lights<br />On-street parking<br />New sidewalks (thanks to the Portland Bureau of Transportation)<br />Rain garden &ndash; where rain water drains</p>
<p>&ldquo;The park makes excellent use of its nearly three acres,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;K&#688;unamokwst is another Portland park demonstrating design excellence, and our Cully neighbors deserve such a gem as their neighborhood gathering place. The long-awaited park will enhance the area as a center of healthy activity through recreation, sports, and reflection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout K&#688;unamokwst Park&rsquo;s planning and design process, care has been taken to include the whole community. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation worked to have Spanish-language translators at open houses, committee meetings, and all other occasions. All park-related documents were translated into Spanish in order to remove longstanding barriers to participation. Planning for the park began in February, 2012, with a 12-member advisory committee. This included focus groups in partnership with the Ortiz Center and Rigler SUN School. Most recently, Hacienda CDC Expresiones worked to involve kids from under-represented communities in helping design some of the exciting park features. The non-profit group Verde and Greenworks, PC, the park&rsquo;s design firm, participated extensively with these endeavors as well.</p>
<p>Fritz adds that she has been proud to continue former Park Commissioner Nick Fish&rsquo;s work to provide the newest neighborhood park in a park-deficient area, one being built with strong community support and extensive neighborhood involvement. Stakeholders in K&#688;unamokwst Park&rsquo;s planning and development include the Cully Association of Neighbors (CAN), Hacienda CDC, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, a consultant team led by Greenworks PC, City Commissioners Amanda Fritz and Nick Fish, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, and other partners, neighbors and PP&amp;R staff. The K&#688;unamokwst project cost is approx. $2.5 million, paid for via SDCs (System Development Charges). SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R purchased the property &ndash; almost two and a half acres - in 2009 to help fulfill the need for park and open space within the Cully Neighborhood.<br />This will be the first developed park in the Cully Neighborhood, an area noted to be park-deficient.</p>
<p>K&#688;unamokwst PARK - PROJECT BACKGROUND<br />https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/61985</p>
<p>The Cully Neighborhood is home to more than 13,000 residents. Cully is a culturally diverse urban neighborhood with a mix of commercial and relatively dense residential development. The northern edge of the neighborhood is the Columbia Slough with its associated lakes and slough extensions. Generally the northern portion of the neighborhood is industrial with a few commercial uses and older homes. The central and southern portions of the neighborhood are residential, with small pockets of commercial development. The major open space landmarks are the 68+ acre Rose City cemetery, Thomas Cully Park, Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, and Colwood Golf Center. The commercial center of the neighborhood is at the intersection of NE Cully, NE 60, and NE Prescott. This five-way intersection is a commercial node with a grocery store and other commercial businesses (1992 Cully Neighborhood Plan).</p>
<p>The K&#688;unamokwst Park Master Plan was a collaborative effort between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the Cully community, and the Project Advisory Committee. The plan is a vision for the project site and a framework to guide the preparation of detailed design documents for the development of the park. Given the amount of public outreach that has occurred on the project as well as acceptance of the master plan by City Council, PP&amp;R will not entertain alternative design concepts. Any significant change in design will require written approval from the Owner&rsquo;s Representative and substantive changes will necessitate public information meeting(s) per the direction of the PP&amp;R Project Manager.</p>

2015,527076,"Portland Parks & Recreation, Verde, Secure Major Federal Grant for Thomas Cully Park",2,,2016-09-08 19:29:56 UTC,2015-04-21 15:46:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>(POSTED APRIL 21, 2014)</strong></p>
<p><br /><em>Project Spearheaded by Verde</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;<br />Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), Verde and the Let Us Build Cully Park! Coalition announce they&rsquo;ve secured a $500,000 grant towards the building of Thomas Cully Park. The half-million dollars comes in the form of a Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) grant from the Department of the Interior, awarded by the National Parks Service, and will go towards developing the future park in Portland&rsquo;s Cully neighborhood, one of the most diverse areas in the state of Oregon.<br />The grant is a significant boost for the unique public-private partnership that is making Thomas Cully Park possible, resulting in a developed, 25-acre park in the Cully neighborhood (on a former brownfield at NE 72nd Avenue, north of Killingsworth) - an area deficient in parks and green spaces.</p>
<p>405 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by Thomas Cully Park.</p>
<p>""This critical investment in the Cully neighborhood of northeast Portland will help build a new playground, walking trail and soccer field, creating spaces for kids and families to get outside and enjoy their community,"" says Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)&nbsp; ""I will continue to fight for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports programs like this, driving community development in places that need it most, improving access to the outdoors and restoring wildlife habitats across the country.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;This grant fits perfectly with the city&rsquo;s philosophy of complete neighborhoods,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said. &ldquo;A complete neighborhood includes good streets, schools, jobs, shopping &hellip; and, of course, parks and recreation. The entire Cully Neighborhood will benefit from this project.&rdquo;<br />The LWCF grant will pay for restoring wildlife habitat, support development of an accessible playground, a walking trail with exercise equipment, scenic overlooks, an off-leash dog area, Intertribal Gathering Garden (open to the public), and a youth soccer field at Thomas Cully Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This grant is a huge boost for Thomas Cully Park, and to the community partners who are so deeply engaged with making the park a reality,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We are so pleased to have great support from our congressional delegation, led by Senator Ron Wyden. With fewer federal funding opportunities we are thankful that he and his staff recognize the immense value of this project and the impact it will have on the Cully community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re tremendously excited and honored that our community&rsquo;s hard work and vision are being realized, &ldquo;says Alan Hip&oacute;lito, Executive Director of Verde, the lead organization in the Let Us Build Cully Park! Coalition. &ldquo;This federal investment in Cully Park is a strong recognition of the power of our community-based model for Park development, and a testament to the continuing partnership and unwavering support we enjoy with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. We are fortunate to do this good, hard work &ndash; with our community, our state, and our many partners and supporters. When Cully Park opens, it is going to make a real difference in the lives of the many diverse people and organizations that call Cully their home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grant, part of a new competitive grant program called the LWCF Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership, is one of eight awarded nationally. According to the Department of the Interior, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has invested revenue from federal offshore oil and gas royalties into more than 40,000 outdoor recreation facilities and conservation projects in every state, for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>""Right now, in Central Northeast Portland, nearly two out of five households are not within a fifteen minute walk of a park or natural area -- standing in contrast to a standard most Portlanders experience,"" says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. ""This grant gets us one step closer to bringing the kind of access to parks that our Cully neighbors deserve. Thomas Cully Park will transform a landfill into a place of healthy activity through sports and recreation. We are honored to work with Verde and the Lets Build Cully Park! Coalition.""</p>
<p>Let Us Build Cully Park! (LUBCP), a coalition of more than 15 community-based organizations, has raised more than $4.85 million dollars for the park&rsquo;s development (including this federal grant of $500,000). An Oregon Parks &amp; Recreation Department (OPRD) grant in 2014 added $473,000 towards building the park. Part of the funds raised came from Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s February 2014 designation of $1.25 million in System Development Charges (SDC) &ndash; money raised from development fees, rather than General Fund tax dollars &ndash; to support Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s construction. SDCs are funds paid by development to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built. The project has set ambitious goals for community participation, target business contracting, workforce diversity and local hiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cully neighborhood is unique; it is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Portland, perhaps the state,&rdquo; notes City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Yet Cully neighbors don&rsquo;t currently have sufficient access to parks or natural areas. The unique public-private partnership between PP&amp;R, Verde and Let Us Build Cully Park shows that this agreement leverages public investment to go even further. The grant provides us with more funds necessary to build the park. Verde and the LUBCP coalition provided have the extensive organizing and economic development to support both the community and the park effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>60% of residents in the future Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s service area are people belonging to traditionally underserved communities, and 45% are people who are experiencing low incomes (annual household income of $40,000 or less). In Central Northeast Portland, nearly two out of five households are not within &frac12; mile of a park or natural area. Data show that Central Northeast is second only to the area east of I-205 in terms of the greatest need for parks and natural areas in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cully is home to some of the most dedicated and motivated community advocates in the City,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;I am proud to work with our partners towards our shared goal of completing Thomas Cully Park.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/527076

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;<br />Mary Anne Cassin has joined Portland Parks &amp; Recreation as the bureau&rsquo;s Parks Bond Program Manager. Cassin oversees the bond team and program that will deliver up to $68 million of much-needed, urgent repairs and improvements to Portland&rsquo;s beloved park system. A group of four project managers, a public involvement specialist and an administrative assistant will round out the bond team in the next couple of months. Once the bonds are sold in late June or early July, the team will begin working on numerous projects all over the city.</p>
<p>Cassin has two degrees in Landscape Architecture, including one from the Harvard Graduate School of Design. She has worked with several private landscape architecture firms and taught at the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Anne brings unparalleled expertise in project management, design work and logistics,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I am excited that someone of her caliber will be leading the effort to fulfilling our promise of meeting some of the most crucial maintenance needs across our parks system, while remaining sensitive to Portlanders&rsquo; ability to pay. We will continue to work with the community throughout this process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she is the newest member of the bond team, Mary Anne is actually a familiar face around Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R). Mary Anne first joined PP&amp;R in 1984 as a landscape architect. During her 22 year career with the bureau, she was the project manager on many notable projects including the Springwater Corridor Trail, both the North and South Park Blocks, and the 2020 Plan, in addition to dozens of neighborhood park renovations. Her role evolved over the 22 years: she not only worked on individual projects, but also did planning, policy work and program development. Mary Anne was instrumental in the Bureau&rsquo;s first memorial policy, formation of the Parks Board and the Parks Foundation.</p>
<p>She left PP&amp;R in 2005 to work briefly at Vancouver / Clark Parks &amp; Recreation and then spent seven years with Metro as the Parks Planning &amp; Development Manager. At Metro, Mary Anne oversaw the design and construction of four new nature parks. Most recently, she was a principal at PLACE, a local design firm that is contracted for work in numerous countries around the world.</p>
<p>When she&rsquo;s not working, Mary Anne enjoys gardening, hiking and reading. She and her husband Ken Meyer have nurtured a half-acre garden in Southwest Portland over the last 26 years. Their son is currently enrolled at the US Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Bond oversight committee named<br />A Community Oversight Committee has been finalized to review the bond implementation performance, and report to Council and the community. The Oversight Committee will track progress on the bond, and ensure that bond promises are kept.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind CLT New Year in the Park?</strong></p>
<p>Saron Khut, the owner of the Cambodian restaurant Mekong Bistro, had the idea to plan a Cambodian New Year celebration at Glenhaven Park, across the street from his restaurant. One day, a few Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) staff came in for lunch, and Saron approached them about the possibility of sponsoring the event. PP&amp;R happily signed on, and the event expanded to include the Lao community with help from Saron&rsquo;s wife, who is Lao, and the Lao Business Association, and then members of the Thai community. The event promises an amazing story of collaboration and hard work from a group of relatively recently-arrived immigrants and refugees who have grown friendships in their new and shared home state of Oregon.</p>
<p><strong>Get involved!</strong></p>
<p>CLA New Year in the Park is a historic, first-time event for Portland, and organizers expect 3,000&ndash;6,000 people from diverse cultural backgrounds to attend.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to support the community and raise awareness of your company or organization.</p>

2015,524103,Portland Parks & Recreation Replacement Bond Measure Moves Forward:,2,,2015-03-27 18:18:32 UTC,2015-03-27 18:17:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>City Council votes April 8 on bond issuance; property tax rates remain the same</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>A crucial component of the City&rsquo;s November 2014 voter-approved ballot initiative moves forward with a Council hearing on Wednesday, April 1, 2015, and an expected vote of April 8, 2015.&nbsp; Portland City Council will consider an ordinance to sell the first issuance of $29 million in general obligation bonds, to fund much-needed repairs to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) sites and facilities.&nbsp; Portland voters overwhelmingly approved the November 2014 parks replacement bond measure, which renews an expiring 1994 bond at the same tax rate.&nbsp; The parks bond measure allows PP&amp;R to raise up to $68 million to meet some of the most critical major maintenance needs across the parks system, including (but not limited to):</p>
<p>-Seven to 15 play areas currently closed, at risk of closure, or deficient, including Couch, Creston, Kenton, Lents, Lynchview, the North Park Blocks, and Ventura Parks</p>
<p>-Bridge and trail repairs, including in Forest Park and along Springwater Corridor</p>
<p>-Repairs at Community pools, including Matt Dishman, Peninsula, Grant</p>
<p>-Sellwood Park buildings, Rieke Field, Multnomah Arts Center, St. Johns Community Center</p>
<p>-Restrooms, roofs, other deficient structures and equipment</p>
<p>-Pioneer Courthouse Square failing structures, leaks, cracks</p>
<p>-Removing barriers to accessibility for people experiencing disabilities, at multiple locations</p>
<p>-Parks maintenance buildings to address worker safety, efficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an exciting time.&nbsp; With approval of the Ordinance, Portlanders will see the highly anticipated project improvements beginning work in our parks, pools and other sites,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up until this point, staff have been working behind the scenes preparing for project implementation.&nbsp; Now our efforts will become more visible. &nbsp;I thank the voters again for their support in enabling us to meet these crucial major maintenance needs.&nbsp; We will continue to work alongside the community throughout this process&ldquo;.</p>
<p>On April 1, City Council will hear the first reading of an ordinance authorizing the first issuance of parks bonds.&nbsp; A subsequent vote is expected on April 8.&nbsp; The ordinance would authorize up to $29 million in voter-approved bonds to finance already-identified parks repair and service projects, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Grant Pool, where pump and filtration systems are in danger of failing</li>
<li>A renovated playground at Lents Park</li>
<li>A Portland Loo at Parklane Park and Wilkes Park</li>
<li>A renovated playground at the North Park Blocks</li>
<li>Forest Park&rsquo;s Maple Trail and Lower Macleay Trail bridges</li>
<li>Matt Dishman Community Center pool repairs</li>
<li>Major maintenance at PP&amp;R buildings including Mt Tabor Yard</li>
<li>ADA improvements at the Washington Park Rose Garden</li>
<li>Summit restroom renovations at Mt Tabor Park</li>
<li>Repairs at Sellwood Pool</li>
<li>Repairs at the Multnomah Arts Center</li>
<li>Repairs to Pioneer Courthouse Square</li>
<li>Seismic and mechanical improvements at St Johns Community Center</li>
<li>Couch Park&rsquo;s playground improvements (note: discussions with the community about the timing and scale of improvements are ongoing.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The major renovations to both Grant Pool and Pioneer Courthouse Square are already underway, with bond project managers assigned. The other projects need to wait until July until the bonds are actually sold.</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz plans to split the bond measure implementation into at least two bond issuances, with the first in June 2015, and a second in 2017. &nbsp;The proceeds from the first bond issuance will cover the first two years of expected project expenditures from the initial, already identified project list.&nbsp; Borrowing the minimum necessary for the first two years minimizes interest paid on money that would otherwise be idle until Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is ready to move forward on the second round of projects.&nbsp; The second issuance, likely in spring or summer of 2017, would fund projects from the initial list which extend beyond the two-year spending window, as well as a second list of projects.&nbsp; The second project list will also focus on urgent major repair and replacement needs, as promised in the ballot measure.&nbsp; Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will conduct a public involvement process in late 2016 to help prioritize the second project list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bureau will also receive public input from a Community Oversight Committee, which will review the bond implementation performance and report to Council and the community.&nbsp; The Oversight Committee will help determine how the approximately $20 million not specifically allocated for the initial project list should be spent.&nbsp; With citywide major parks maintenance needs of over $300 million still unfunded, there will still be many competing needs for these funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this and at every other milestone along the way of implementing the Parks Replacement Bond, we want to thank Portlanders,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &nbsp;&ldquo;Their support of this bond reaffirms their stewardship of our park system and will allow us to meet critical major maintenance needs. Our work strives for better places and parks for all visitors. &nbsp;We will continue to work alongside the community in the implementation of this bond and look forward to reporting back on its progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz has approved supplementing bond funds in a small number of key projects with System Development Charges (SDC) funds as appropriate. SDCs are one-time fees assessed on new development, to cover a portion of the costs of providing capacity-increasing park improvements for our growing community. &nbsp;Parks SDC money can only be spent on capital improvements that increase the capacity of parks and recreation.&nbsp; These projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parklane Park (new Portland Loo)</li>
<li>Ventura Park (new playground and Loo to serve rapidly growing east Portland community, including nearly 1500 youth and a nearby school)</li>
<li>Wilkes Park (new Portland Loo)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;""We will continue to look for ways to leverage bond funds with outside grants and private fundraising efforts,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;Parks staff is fully engaged in planning refinement, staff recruitment and orientation, with the goal to begin construction soon as possible once bond proceeds are available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bonds will be paid off over a period of no more than 15 years.&nbsp; The City expects to sell the first bonds in June, 2015, via competitive bidding.&nbsp; Community members interested in purchasing bonds should contact their investment brokers for information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;This parks replacement bond helps pay for some of the most crucial maintenance needs across our parks system, while remaining sensitive to Portlanders&rsquo; ability to pay,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;These funds will make a major difference, although they won&rsquo;t completely close the gap our parks and facilities face.&nbsp; I will continue to look for ways to address the needs of our parks system.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/524103
2015,524011,"City Council Approves Lents Park Ordinance, Brings Baseball Back to Portland in 2016",2,,2015-03-26 15:55:24 UTC,2015-03-26 15:54:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>New Team Based at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Walker Stadium in Lents</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland City Council today approved and finalized the agreement between Rose City Baseball, LLC, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and the Portland Development Commission (PDC) to bring baseball back to the City of Portland.&nbsp; The partners <a href=""/parks/article/522234"">first announced on the news</a> on March 10, 2015, welcoming a new college wood-bat team based in east Portland.&nbsp; The Great West League&rsquo;s new baseball team (soon-to-be <a href=""http://www.portlandsbaseballteam.com"">named by Portland&rsquo;s fans</a>!) will play home games at Walker Stadium, in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park (SE 92<sup>nd</sup> and Holgate), beginning in the 2016 season.&nbsp; The renovated stadium will also be available for Little League teams, adult recreation leagues, and anyone else who wishes to permit play.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT</strong>: New baseball team comes to Portland, public stadium renovated for all leagues and players</p>
<p><strong>WHERE</strong>: Walker Stadium at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park, SE 92<sup>nd</sup> &amp; Holgate</p>
<p><strong>WHEN</strong>: Team begins play in summer 2016</p>
<p><strong>HOW</strong>: Partnership between Rose City Baseball, Great West League, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Portland Development Commission</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Baseball Team is owned and operated by Rose City Baseball, LLC, under the direction of team President and CEO Ken Wilson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a void in the city since the Portland Beavers left, and having baseball so conveniently located for neighbors in east Portland will be terrific&rdquo;, says Wilson.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to bring affordable family entertainment to Portland and we believe Walker Stadium will be one of the most exciting ball parks in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Walker Stadium will have a capacity of 1,500, including group event areas.&nbsp; The stadium in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park was constructed in 1956.&nbsp; It is located within easy reach of mass transit and major freeways.&nbsp; The updated Walker Stadium will cater to fans&rsquo; enjoyment of professional-style baseball with amenities including multiple concession stands, a playground and group event areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the most exciting entertainment in Portland, and we want the half-million people within 15 minutes of the ballpark to know that this team belongs to them,&rdquo; adds Wilson.</p>
<p>The public/private partnership between Rose City Baseball, LLC, and the City of Portland will also bring gleaming upgrades and needed repairs to Lents Park&rsquo;s centerpiece, Walker Stadium.&nbsp; Outside of the 30 Great West League baseball games annually, the freshly renovated stadium will be available for play by recreational players or anyone else to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finally seeing some real development in Lents,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said. &ldquo;The team and stadium improvements will be great for the east Portland neighborhood.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an advocate for complete neighborhoods, and this plan will help Lents to shine! The city is delighted to partner with Ken and his colleagues in bringing baseball back to the Rose City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baseball has been missed in Portland, and I am excited to have the game returning,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I appreciate that this public/private partnership provides stadium improvements that all Portlanders can enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the partnership, Fritz added, the much-needed renovations to Walker Stadium would not be occurring for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; The stadium will be open for community use for the majority of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lents is in a part of town &ndash; east Portland - that deserves an improved parks and recreation experience,&rdquo; added Fritz, &ldquo;and this endeavor is a solid complement to the new parks which PP&amp;R is building in east Portland &ndash; <a href=""/parks/65392"">Beech Park</a> and <a href=""/parks/66064"">Gateway Park &amp; Urban Plaza</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Team owner Ken Wilson had a similar role in another summer wood-bat league for collegians, serving as president of the West Coast League.&nbsp; He spent more than two decades as a broadcaster for Major League Baseball and the NHL.&nbsp; Wilson, who lives in Portland, spent six seasons with legendary Seattle Mariners play-by-play announcer Dave Niehaus.</p>
<p>Pat Gillick, the Great West League co-founder along with Wilson, is the current president of MLB&rsquo;s Philadelphia Phillies and a National Baseball Hall of Fame member.&nbsp; He has been general manager of four MLB teams, including the Mariners (2000-03).&nbsp; Gillick won two World Series championships with the Toronto Blue Jays and one with the Phillies.</p>
<p>The City and Rose City Baseball are teaming up on $650,000 worth of improvements to the stadium, including new chair-back seating, the addition of group event areas, a new scoreboard, team offices, a new press box, new concession services, new dugouts, a major league backstop, a new irrigated grass playing surface and a children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>The yet-to-be-named baseball team will play 30 home games per 60 game season.&nbsp; The team will pay rent to the City, clean the stadium, and provide security during games. Outside of the dates set aside for the team, the stadium will be open for permitted play by anyone who reserves it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Development Commission&rsquo;s investment is consistent with our commitments to the community and neighborhood association,&rdquo; says PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are delighted that Rose City Baseball will hire local youth and develop partnerships with local community-based organizations, such as Lents Grown and Lents Little League.&nbsp; Since 1998, PDC has made more than $5 million in investments in parks and open space in the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal Area&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Financial contributions for the partnership:</p>
<p>Rose City Baseball: $400,000</p>
<p>Portland Development Commission: $200,000</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation: $50,000</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>About the Great West League</strong></p>
<p>The Great West League is one of the premier summer collegiate wood bat leagues in North America, providing a professional, minor league-like atmosphere for top college players seeking professional baseball careers, while providing affordable family entertainment and enriching the quality of life in its member communities.</p>
<p>The league will begin play with six teams, each playing a 60-game schedule.&nbsp; Portland, OR, Chico and Lodi, California, have each secured teams.&nbsp; The remaining teams will be announced by late summer.</p>

2015,522234,Baseball is Coming Back to Portland in 2016:,2,,2015-03-11 19:12:45 UTC,2015-03-11 19:12:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>New Team Based at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Walker Stadium in Lents</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p><br />Rose City Baseball, LLC, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and the Portland Development Commission (PDC) announce today that baseball is returning to the City of Portland with a new college wood-bat team based in east Portland. The City and the Great West League are partnering to bring Portland&rsquo;s new baseball team (soon-to-be named by Portland&rsquo;s fans!) to Walker Stadium in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park (SE 92nd and Holgate) for the 2016 season.</p>
<p>WHAT: New baseball team comes to Portland, public stadium renovated for all leagues and players<br />WHERE: Walker Stadium at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park, SE 92nd &amp; Holgate<br />WHEN: Team begins play in summer 2016<br />HOW: Partnership between Rose City Baseball, Great West League, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Portland Development Commission</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s Baseball Team is owned and operated by Rose City Baseball, LLC, under the direction of team President and CEO Ken Wilson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a void in the city since the Portland Beavers left, and having baseball so conveniently located for neighbors in east Portland will be terrific&rdquo;, says Wilson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to bring affordable family entertainment to Portland and we believe Walker Stadium will be one of the most exciting ball parks in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Walker Stadium will have a capacity of 1,500, including group event areas. The stadium in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Lents Park was constructed in 1956. It is located within easy reach of mass transit and major freeways. The updated Walker Stadium will cater to fans&rsquo; enjoyment of professional-style baseball with amenities including multiple concession stands, a playground and group event areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the most exciting entertainment in Portland, and we want the half-million people within 15 minutes of the ballpark to know that this team belongs to them,&rdquo; adds Wilson.</p>
<p>The public/private partnership between Rose City Baseball, LLC, and the City of Portland will also bring gleaming upgrades and needed repairs to Lents Park&rsquo;s centerpiece, Walker Stadium. Outside of the 30 Great West League baseball games annually, the freshly renovated stadium will be available for play by recreational players or anyone else to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finally seeing some real development in Lents,&rdquo; Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said. &ldquo;The team and stadium improvements will be great for the east Portland neighborhood. I&rsquo;m an advocate for complete neighborhoods, and this plan will help Lents to shine! The city is delighted to partner with Ken and his colleagues in bringing baseball back to the Rose City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baseball has been missed in Portland, and I am excited to have the game returning,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I appreciate that this public/private partnership provides stadium improvements that all Portlanders can enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without the partnership, Fritz added, the much-needed renovations to Walker Stadium would not be occurring for the foreseeable future. The stadium will be open for community use for the majority of the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lents is in a part of town &ndash; east Portland - that deserves an improved parks and recreation experience,&rdquo; added Fritz, &ldquo;and this endeavor is a solid complement to the new parks which PP&amp;R is building in east Portland &ndash; Beech Park and Gateway Park &amp; Urban Plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Team owner Ken Wilson had a similar role in another summer wood-bat league for collegians, serving as president of the West Coast League. He spent more than two decades as a broadcaster for Major League Baseball and the NHL. Wilson, who lives in Portland, spent six seasons with legendary Seattle Mariners play-by-play announcer Dave Niehaus.<br />Pat Gillick, the Great West League co-founder along with Wilson, is the current president of MLB&rsquo;s Philadelphia Phillies and a National Baseball Hall of Fame member. He has been general manager of four MLB teams, including the Mariners (2000-03). Gillick won two World Series championships with the Toronto Blue Jays and one with the Phillies.</p>
<p>The City and Rose City Baseball are teaming up on $650,000 worth of improvements to the stadium, including new chair-back seating, the addition of group event areas, a new scoreboard, team offices, a new press box, new concession services, new dugouts, a major league backstop, a new irrigated grass playing surface and a children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>The yet-to-be-named baseball team will play 30 home games per 60 game season. The team will pay rent to the City, clean the stadium, and provide security during games. Outside of the dates set aside for the team, the stadium will be open for permitted play by anyone who reserves it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Development Commission&rsquo;s investment is consistent with our commitments to the community and neighborhood association,&rdquo; says PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton. &ldquo;We are delighted that Rose City Baseball will hire local youth and develop partnerships with local community-based organizations, such as Lents Grown and Lents Little League. Since 1998, PDC has made more than $5 million in investments in parks and open space in the Lents Town Center Urban Renewal Area&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Financial contributions for the partnership:<br />Rose City Baseball: $400,000<br />Portland Development Commission: $200,000<br />Portland Parks &amp; Recreation: $50,000</p>
<p>About the Great West League<br />The Great West League is one of the premier summer collegiate wood bat leagues in North America, providing a professional, minor league-like atmosphere for top college players seeking professional baseball careers, while providing affordable family entertainment and enriching the quality of life in its member communities.</p>
<p>The league will begin play with six teams, each playing a 60-game schedule. Portland, OR, Chico and Lodi, California, have each secured teams. The remaining teams will be announced by late summer.</p>
<p>Ken Wilson, who also serves as President of the GWL, is a co-founder of the league along with Pat Gillick, a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and currently President of the Philadelphia Phillies. Gillick is part owner of the Chico Heat.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the team called? That&rsquo;s up to YOU!<br />Portland&rsquo;s Baseball Team has unveiled a website at www.portlandsbaseballteam.com. A &ldquo;Name Your Team&rdquo; contest begins immediately and fans can go to the team website to vote for their choice for the team nickname.</p>

<p>March 3, 2015</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the non-profit Portland Parks Foundation (PPF), is moving on after four years in PPF&rsquo;s top position. Hardigg helped lead the Foundation&rsquo;s lasting alliance with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) as the bureau&rsquo;s valued fundraising partner. He takes over as Executive Director of the Portland Audubon Society beginning March 23.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R and PPF have partnered over the last several years to grow the vaunted Summer Free For All series of free concerts, movies, lunch and playground programs throughout Portland. Under Hardigg&rsquo;s leadership, the Foundation launched Parke Diem (Portland&rsquo;s largest park volunteer event), and Parklandians Unite (a parks friends and partner event). Most recently, Hardigg and the Foundation continue to have the gratitude of PP&amp;R for the role they played in partnering with the Fix Our Parks campaign, and helping shape and pass the vital 2014 Parks Replacement Bond.<br />&ldquo;Nick has been a great partner for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the City of Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;He was a key partner and leader in getting the Parks Bond passed last November. The Audubon Society is very fortunate to have Nick as their next Executive Director. I look forward to working with him in his new role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank Nick for all his far-reaching work,&rdquo; says Elizabeth Whalen, Chair of the Portland Parks Foundation Board. &ldquo;He was a tireless advocate for the Parks Replacement Bond, created the Foundation&rsquo;s fiscal sponsorship program, and Nick has helped establish the Foundation as one of Portland's leading voices for parks and parks access&mdash;raising awareness across the city about park needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick brought energy, enthusiasm and expertise to his role at the Foundation,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We are grateful for his extensive efforts in building grassroots community support for our people, places and programs. He has been a key player in fundraising and awareness efforts, and we thank him very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About Nick Hardigg<br />Before he joined Portland Parks Foundation, Nick led Alaska's largest fundraising foundation for the environment, Alaska Conservation Foundation, where he successfully restructured programs and tripled funds raised to over $4 million annually. He has worked for The Nature Conservancy in Oregon as director of finance and operations, and was in charge of public-private partnerships for the National Park Service at the Grand Canyon and Denali National Park, where he initiated nationally-recognized fundraising programs and contracting reforms.</p>
<p><br />Nick has an MBA from Yale University, and a BA in environmental science from Wesleyan University. He serves on boards of the Association of Partners for Public Lands, Alaska Geographic (the nonprofit partner for Alaska's parks), and the MBA Nonprofit Connection. Past board experience includes Bicycle Commuters of Anchorage (co-founder), the Foraker Group (Alaska's nonprofit association), and the Grand Canyon Community Center. In his free time, Nick can often be found in Portland&rsquo;s parks with his family.</p>
<p>About the Portland Parks Foundation</p>
<p>Portland Parks Foundation is an independent, 501(c) 3 nonprofit organization formed in 2001 to bring resources for the long-term stewardship of Portland's parks and park programs, and to ensure that they remain publicly supported.

2015,519547,"Portland Parks & Recreation Parks and Facilities to Become Smoke, Tobacco-Free",2,,2016-04-20 16:28:50 UTC,2015-02-18 23:01:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>City Council Votes to Expand Smoke &amp; Tobacco Ban System-wide</em></p>
<p>POSTED FEBRUARY 18, 2015</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland City Council approved a policy today expanding Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s smoking and tobacco ban throughout the entire parks system.&nbsp; Starting July 1, 2015, all City parks, natural areas, community centers, trails, golf courses, recreation areas, and all other sites where PP&amp;R park rules apply will be smoke and tobacco-free.&nbsp; Currently, more than 500 cities and towns nationwide have laws mandating smoke-free parks<a title="""" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>, including 64 other cities and counties in Oregon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Expanding PP&amp;R&rsquo;s existing tobacco-free policy across the entire system sends a consistent message,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who brought the policy to Council.&nbsp; &ldquo;It helps to create healthy and safe environments within all of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation &ndash; especially for children and youth. This policy aligns with PP&amp;R&rsquo;s focus of &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Prohibited smoking and tobacco products include, but are not limited to: bidis, cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, clove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine vaporizers, nicotine liquids, hookahs, kreteks, pipes, chew, snuff, smokeless tobacco, and marijuana.&nbsp; The expanded policy will also apply to events held at PP&amp;R properties, with a provision for golf tournaments to allow smoking under permitted and certain conditions.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R currently prohibits tobacco use at Director Park, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and the portion of the South Park Blocks that is located on Portland State University&rsquo;s campus. Smoking is also prohibited within 25 feet of any play structure, picnic table or designated children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>Any person who violates the policy will not be subject to an exclusion or criminal enforcement. Rather, a person in violation of the policy shall be required to leave the Park in which the offense occurred, for the remainder of the day. Enforcement will only be administered by PP&amp;R staff who have the authority to enforce park rules, except that any person providing security services at Pioneer Courthouse Square, Director Park, or that portion of the South Park Blocks adjacent to Portland State University may enforce the prohibitions on tobacco and smoking in that Park, but only in the manner mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Expanded Smoke &amp; Tobacco-Free Parks Policy FAQ</strong></p>
<p>These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) may also be found at https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/534296</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why is Portland Parks &amp; Recreation expanding its smoke and tobacco &ndash; free parks policy to all City parks, natural areas, recreation areas, and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply? </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) currently prohibits smoking at Director Park, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and the portion of the South Park Blocks that is located on Portland State University&rsquo;s campus. Smoking is also prohibited within 25 feet of any play structure, picnic table or designated children&rsquo;s play area. Expanding the smoke-free policy to all City parks, natural areas, recreation areas and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply sends a consistent message that aligns with PP&amp;R&rsquo;s focus: &ldquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of a smoke and tobacco-free parks policy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creates healthy and safe environments for Portland residents and visitors, especially children and youth.</li>
<li>Protects parks and natural areas from potential risk of fires.</li>
<li>Protects parks and natural areas from environmental degradation caused by littering of cigarette butts and other tobacco-related waste.</li>
<li>Supports individuals who are trying to quit smoking or tobacco use or have already quit.</li>
<li>Reduces exposure of children and youth to smoking and tobacco use, protecting their health and discouraging them from starting a habit that is difficult to quit.</li>
<li>Contributes to cost savings: tobacco-related disease is still the leading cause of preventable death in Oregon and costs Multnomah County $223.5 million each year</li>
<li>In medical care and $195.7 million in lost productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>When will this policy take effect?</strong></p>
<p>The policy will be voted on by Portland City Council on February 11th. If City Council approves the policy, it will become effective on July 1st, 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What products will be covered under the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy?</strong></p>
<p>No person shall smoke or use tobacco in any form in any place in any Park. For purposes of this policy, smoking and tobacco are defined to include, but are not limited to: bidis, cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, clove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine vaporizers, nicotine liquids, hookahs, kreteks, pipes, chew, snuff, smokeless tobacco, and marijuana.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why are e-cigarettes prohibited?</strong></p>
<p>While the jury is still out on the effects of e-cigarettes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that they may be an emerging public health issue. More research is needed to understand the health impacts of e-cigarettes, but studies have found carcinogens and toxins contained in e-cigarettes (iii).</p>
<p>The CDC reports a sharp rise in the number of calls to the U.S. Poison Control Center concerning children exposed to liquid nicotine (iv)</p>
<p>Without state or federal age restrictions and flavors like gummi bear and cherry, e-cigarettes are also growing in popularity among youth (v).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will there be designated smoking areas?</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Director, in consultation with the Commissioner in Charge, in a manner consistent with the City&rsquo;s Human Resource Administrative Rules, may establish designated smoking areas for Parks employees for whom there is no reasonably available non-parks property where smoking is allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will the policy apply to events that take place at PP&amp;R properties?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the policy will apply to events held at PP&amp;R properties with a provision for golf tournaments to allow smoking under certain conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What will be/has been done to address cultural issues for groups such as Native Americans?</strong></p>
<p>Smoking of noncommercial tobacco products for ceremonial purposes in spaces designated for traditional ceremonies in accordance with the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. 1996, as well as for similar religious ceremonial uses for other cultural groups is permitted. &ldquo;Noncommercial tobacco products&rdquo; means unprocessed tobacco plants or tobacco by-products used for ceremonial or spiritual purposes by Native Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy a violation of civil and /or Constitutional rights?</strong></p>
<p>No. This policy does not take away individuals&rsquo; rights to choose to smoke or use tobacco, it just asks them to refrain from smoking or using tobacco while visiting</p>
<p>City parks, natural areas, recreation areas, and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply.</p>
<p><strong>How will the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy be enforced?</strong></p>
<p>Following Portland City Council approval, there will be a five-month grace period to educate the public about the policy. Starting July 1, 2015, while any violation of a City Code is a misdemeanor which could lead to citation, the primary method of enforcement will be education. Patrons who refuse to comply with the policy may also be subject to a parks exclusion. Enforcement will be administered by PP&amp;R staff and other park officers who have the authority to enforce park rules.</p>
<p><strong>What resources are available to help people quit smoking?</strong></p>
<p>Quitting smoking and using tobacco can be hard, but there are resources available to help. Some of these resources can be found through Multnomah County and on the Oregon Health Authority&rsquo;s Get Help Quitting webpage.</p>

2015,518358,"Commissioner Fritz asks City Council to make all Portland Parks & Recreation Parks and Facilities Smoke, Tobacco-Free",2,,2015-02-09 17:27:33 UTC,2015-02-09 17:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>Hearing on February 11, Vote on Expanded Tobacco Ban expected on February 18</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, February 11, Portland City Council will consider a measure to expand Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s smoking and tobacco ban throughout the entire parks system.&nbsp; If Council approves the change, then all City parks, natural areas, community centers, trails, golf courses, recreation areas, and all other sites where PP&amp;R park rules apply would be tobacco-free starting on July 1, 2015.&nbsp; Currently, more than 500 cities and towns nationwide have laws mandating smoke-free parks<a title="""" href=""#_ftn1"">[1]</a>, including 64 other cities and counties in Oregon.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R currently prohibits tobacco use at Director Park, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and the portion of the South Park Blocks that is located on Portland State University&rsquo;s campus. Smoking is also prohibited within 25 feet of any play structure, picnic table or designated children&rsquo;s play area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expanding PP&amp;R&rsquo;s existing tobacco-free policy across the entire system sends a consistent message,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who will bring the measure to Council.&nbsp; &ldquo;It helps to create healthy and safe environments within all of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation &ndash; especially for children and youth. This measure aligns with PP&amp;Rs focus of &lsquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prohibited smoking and tobacco products include, but are not limited to: bidis, cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, clove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine vaporizers, nicotine liquids, hookahs, kreteks, pipes, chew, snuff, smokeless tobacco, and marijuana.&nbsp; The expanded policy would also apply to events held at PP&amp;R properties, with a provision for golf tournaments to allow smoking under certain conditions.</p>
<p>If the measure passes, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation would embark on educational outreach to bring awareness to the expanded policy, which would begin on July 1, 2015.&nbsp; Targeted stakeholders would include neighbors and neighborhood associations, all City employees, businesses and business associations, government agencies, and community and partner groups.</p>
<p>While any violation of a City Code is a misdemeanor which could lead to citation, at the outset of the expanded tobacco-free policy, the primary method of enforcement would be education. Patrons who refuse to comply with park rules could also be subject to a parks exclusion. Enforcement would be administered by PP&amp;R staff and other public safety officials who have the authority to enforce park rules.</p>
<p><strong>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Expanded Smoke &amp; Tobacco-Free Parks Policy FAQ</strong></p>
<p>These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) may also be found at <a href=""/parks/article/516005"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/516005</a></p>
<p><strong>Why is Portland Parks &amp; Recreation considering expanding its smoke and tobacco &ndash; free parks policy to all City parks, natural areas, recreation areas, and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply?</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) currently prohibits smoking at Director Park, Pioneer Courthouse Square, and the portion of the South Park Blocks that is located on Portland State University&rsquo;s campus. Smoking is also prohibited within 25 feet of any play structure, picnic table or designated children&rsquo;s play area. Expanding the smoke-free policy to all City parks, natural areas, recreation areas and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply sends a consistent message that aligns with PP&amp;R&rsquo;s focus: &ldquo;Healthy Parks, Healthy Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>What are the benefits of a smoke and tobacco-free parks policy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creates healthy and safe environments for Portland residents and visitors, especially children and youth.</li>
<li>Protects parks and natural areas from potential risk of fires.</li>
<li>Protects parks and natural areas from environmental degradation caused by littering of cigarette butts and other tobacco-related waste.</li>
<li>Supports individuals who are trying to quit smoking or tobacco use or have already quit.</li>
<li>Reduces exposure of children and youth to smoking and tobacco use, protecting their health and discouraging them from starting a habit that is difficult to quit.</li>
<li>Contributes to cost savings: tobacco-related disease is still the leading cause of preventable death in Oregon and costs Multnomah County $223.5 million each year</li>
<li>In medical care and $195.7 million in lost productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When would this policy take effect?</strong></p>
<p>The policy will be voted on by Portland City Council on February 18th. If City Council approves the policy, it will become effective on July 1st, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>What products would be covered under the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy?</strong></p>
<p>No person shall smoke or use tobacco in any form in any place in any Park. For purposes of this policy, smoking and tobacco are defined to include, but are not limited to: bidis, cigarettes, cigarillos, cigars, clove cigarettes, e-cigarettes, nicotine vaporizers, nicotine liquids, hookahs, kreteks, pipes, chew, snuff, smokeless tobacco, and marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>Why would e-cigarettes be prohibited?</strong></p>
<p>While the jury is still out on the effects of e-cigarettes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that they may be an emerging public health issue. More research is needed to understand the health impacts of e-cigarettes, but studies have found carcinogens and toxins contained in e-cigarettes (iii).</p>
<p>The CDC reports a sharp rise in the number of calls to the U.S. Poison Control Center concerning children exposed to liquid nicotine (iv).&nbsp; Without state or federal age restrictions and flavors like gummi bear and cherry, e-cigarettes are also growing in popularity among youth (v).</p>
<p><strong>Would there be designated smoking areas?</strong></p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Director, in consultation with the Commissioner in Charge, in a manner consistent with the City&rsquo;s Human Resource Administrative Rules, may establish designated smoking areas for Parks employees for whom there is no reasonably available non-parks property where smoking is allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Would the policy apply to events that take place at PP&amp;R properties?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the policy would apply to events held at PP&amp;R properties with a provision for golf tournaments to allow smoking under certain conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What will be/has been done to address cultural issues for groups such as Native Americans?</strong></p>
<p>Smoking of noncommercial tobacco products for ceremonial purposes in spaces designated for traditional ceremonies in accordance with the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. 1996, as well as for similar religious ceremonial uses for other cultural groups is permitted. &ldquo;Noncommercial tobacco products&rdquo; means unprocessed tobacco plants or tobacco by-products used for ceremonial or spiritual purposes by Native Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is a smoke and tobacco-free parks policy a violation of civil and /or Constitutional rights?</strong></p>
<p>No. This policy would not take away individuals&rsquo; rights to choose to smoke or use tobacco, it would only ask them to refrain from smoking or using tobacco while visiting City parks, natural areas, recreation areas, and any other areas where PP&amp;R park rules apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How would the smoke and tobacco-free parks policy be enforced?</strong></p>
<p>If Portland City Council approves the tobacco-free expansion, there will be a five-month grace period to educate the public about the policy. Starting July 1, 2015, while any violation of a City Code is a misdemeanor which could lead to citation, the primary method of enforcement would be education. Patrons who refuse to comply with the policy may also be subject to a parks exclusion. Enforcement would be administered by PP&amp;R staff and other public safety officials who have the authority to enforce park rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What resources are available to help people quit smoking?</strong></p>
<p>Quitting smoking and using tobacco can be hard, but there are resources available to help. Some of these resources can be found through Multnomah County and on the Oregon Health Authority (OHA)&rsquo;s Get Help Quitting webpage.</p>

<p><strong>Public Input Welcomed on Potential Park Designs</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will hold a pair of open houses on the potential designs of Beech Park and Gateway Park &amp; Urban Plaza.&nbsp; PP&amp;R staff will present design options to the public at these community forums and solicit input.</p>
<p><strong>Beech Park</strong></p>
<p><strong>What: Community open house for potential designs of Beech Park<br />When: Thursday, February 26, 2015.&nbsp; 5:30pm-7:30pm<br />Where: Shaver Elementary School, 3701 NE 131<sup>st</sup> Place, Portland</strong></p>

<p><strong>What: Community open house for potential designs of Gateway Park &amp; Urban Plaza<br />When: Tuesday, February 17, 2015 5:30 PM-7:30 PM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where: Sacramento Elementary School, 11400 NE Sacramento St. </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Public involvement is a vital component of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s process for planning and design,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are building new parks in areas that desperately need them, and we want to hear from those who will benefit regarding the design and proposed features.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Construction on Beech Park is expected to begin in early 2016, with a potential completion date of mid-2017.&nbsp; Gateway Park&rsquo;s construction is also expected to begin in early 2016, with anticipated completion in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>In January, 2014 Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and Portland Development Commission (PDC) announce plans for building two new parks in east Portland, a traditionally underserved area of the city.&nbsp; PP&amp;R is now in the design process on both Beech Park (approximately 16 acres off NE 126th Ave &amp; Beech St.) and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza (four acres off NE Halsey St between NE 104<sup>th</sup> &amp; 106<sup>th </sup>Aves) with construction on both parks scheduled to begin in early 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In east Portland, <strong>two out of every five households</strong> <strong>do not have easy access to a City park.&nbsp; </strong>That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area,&rdquo; says Fritz, who designated Beech and Gateway Plaza Parks for development after careful consideration of community input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a significant step in correcting historic inequities in parks in east Portland,&rdquo; adds Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.&nbsp; &ldquo;All over Portland, people are telling me, &lsquo;Provide parks for people who don&rsquo;t have one&rsquo;. There are challenges in every neighborhood, and insufficient resources to correct them all. These two projects begin to correct the disparities in east Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Mayor Charlie Hales noted the Portland Development Commission&rsquo;s $1 million contribution towards Gateway Park and Plaza.&nbsp; &ldquo;PDC&rsquo;s partnership will help revitalize the commercial appeal and livability of the Gateway neighborhood&rdquo;, said Hales.</p>
<p><strong>Fast Facts on </strong><a href=""/parks/65392""><strong>Beech Park</strong></a><strong>:</strong></p>
<p><em>Features</em></p>
<p><em>-</em> Adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in the Parkrose School District, in the Argay neighborhood of NE Portland.&nbsp; It will feature grand views, a sports field and basketball court, accessible play and picnic areas, shelters, pedestrian and bike paths, parking, community gardens, and a fenced off-leash dog area.</p>
<p><em>Equity/Equal Access</em></p>
<p>-The park will serve nearly 965 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 49% of these households are ethnic minorities, and 23% are below the poverty level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>WHERE: PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Montavilla Community Center (8219 NE Glisan St).</p>
<p>WHO: This first-ever, FREE event is for youth ages 14-20. Partners include The Audubon Society of Portland, Multnomah ESD Outdoor School, the Oregon Zoo, Saturday Academy, Portland Trackers Earth and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Environmental Education.</p>
<p>The Youth Environmental Job Fair &amp; Teen Night will give teens the resources, information and networking that will help them pursue environmental careers. All of the partner organizations involved in the event are now actively hiring and recruiting staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All organizations involved with this exciting event share a common purpose: to train emerging environmental leaders and prepare them for careers,&rdquo; says Kelly Rosteck, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Environmental Education coordinator. &ldquo;By pooling our resources, PP&amp;R and our partners can all get to know more young people, and more quickly. On December 30, teens can enjoy food and fun, and meet dozens of program graduates who can talk about their jobs and organizations. We feel a first-person account of satisfying work will make an environmental career seem realistic to young folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation believes in the importance of connecting youth with nature to foster a lifelong relationship. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s role consists of a pipeline of environmental education, employment, job skills training and outdoor adventure programs for young adults ages 13&ndash;24. These programs include the Greenspaces Restoration and Urban Naturalist Team (GRUNT), Jr. GRUNT, internships, and the Youth Conservation Crew (YCC). Environmental Education classes, guided walks, camps, volunteer opportunities, and special events focus on the forest, grassland, and water ecosystems available in neighborhoods throughout the city. From young children to older adults, people of all ages can find active involvement with nature close to home.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Environmental Education experiences for youth are geared towards training emerging environmental leaders and preparing them for careers. Fewer than 13% of government environmental agencies employees are people with color (~37% of the population of the US are people of color).</p>
<p>343: the number of graduates from PP&amp;R&rsquo;s environmental education programs.</p>
<p>85: percentage of those graduates who are eligible for the free &amp; reduced lunch program at schools.</p>
<p>53: percentage of graduates who speak English as a second language.</p>

2014,513178,"City of Portland Implements New Tree Program and Regulations – Effective January 2, 2015",2,,2014-12-19 20:27:14 UTC,2014-12-19 20:25:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s Title 11 Tree Code regulations will go into effect on Friday, January 2, 2015.&nbsp; The Tree Project, including the new Code adopted by Portland City Council in 2011, is managed collaboratively by the Bureau of Development Services and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.</p>
<p>The Tree Project provides:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the City's tree regulations adopted by City Council in 2011</li>
<li>Streamlined regulations for more consistency, clarity and ease</li>
<li>Greater protection of trees</li>
<li>Improved enforcement of tree rules</li>
<li>A single starting point for both the general public and contractors seeking information and permits</li>
</ul>
<p>The Tree Code regulations are intended to enhance Portland&rsquo;s urban forest.&nbsp; &nbsp;They are designed to provide consistent and clear tree-related information and permitting processes for both contractors and the general public.&nbsp; The regulations will apply to permitting and construction-related activities, and also to tree removal and pruning on private property and in public right-of-way planting areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s tree canopy is one of the factors that makes our city such a wonderful place to live, work, and play,&rdquo; says City Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who oversees both PP&amp;R and BDS.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Portland Tree project and the new regulations will help increase the number and health of trees, which will reduce air pollution and stormwater runoff, and increase home values while expanding wildlife habitat.&nbsp; The key new information for Portlanders is, &lsquo;Call before you cut!&rsquo;&nbsp; Call 503-823-TREE to find out how the new standards may affect your tree planting, pruning, or removal plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may also call 503-823-TREE or email <a href=""mailto:trees@portlandoregon.gov"">trees@portlandoregon.gov</a> for tree regulation and permitting questions, and to report fallen trees in city streets.</p>

<p>You may inquire about tree permitting at the City Development Service Center (DSC), 1900 SW 4th Avenue.</p>
<p>""Call before you cut!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After January 2, 2015, please remember to &ldquo;call before you cut&rdquo; - 503-823-TREE (8733)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT OUR TREES</strong></p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s trees have many benefits.&nbsp; Trees reduce air pollution and filter stormwater run-off before it enters the wastewater treatment system.&nbsp; Trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere, provide shade, and decrease the amount of summer heat in the urban environment.&nbsp; They provide recreation and wildlife habitat; and make neighborhoods more livable.&nbsp; The new City Tree Regulations help ensure that Portland&rsquo;s urban forest will continue to provide benefits for future generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The new Tree Code regulations are the outcome of the <a href=""/bps/46921"">Citywide Tree Policy Review and Regulatory Improvement Project</a>, approved by City Council in May, 2011.&nbsp; This was a comprehensive and inclusive project that involved multiple community and City bureau stakeholders. Implementation of the new regulations was delayed until now due to the economic recession.</p>

<p>Celebrating 10 Successful Years of Holiday Train Rides with reduced ticket prices</p>
<p>On November 28th as the SP&amp;S 700 pulls out of Oaks Park Station, hissing and billowing steam, it marks the 10th year for the Holiday Express. As the vintage train runs on the Oregon Pacific Railroad along the Willamette River, it doesn&rsquo;t take long for the hypnotic movement of the clickety-clack to transport riders to places once visited or imagined.</p>
<p>In December 2005, a new event bonded generations as families rode beside the WillametteRiveron the Oregon Pacific Railroad in Southeast Portland. For the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation&rsquo;s (ORHF) first annual fundraiser, Holiday Express, two historic steam locomotives launched a new holiday tradition. Now celebrating its tenth year, ORHF is rolling back Holiday Express ticket prices to less than last year for many of its first weekend runs, November 28-30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holiday Express is a special opportunity for families to experience the bygone era of steam power,&rdquo; saidEd Immel, Vice President of ORHF. &ldquo;It is the only holiday train ride inOregon featuring a full-size steam locomotive, the Spokane,Portland &amp; Seattle #700.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The immense scale of the Spokane, Portlandand Seattle700 (SP&amp;S 700) is hard to miss; it weighs 440 tons and is over 100 feet long. The drive wheels dwarf all but the tallest of humans. The SP&amp;S 700 is operated and maintained by the all-volunteer Pacific Railroad Preservation Association.</p>
<p>At the Holiday Express people who rode behind steam locomotives 50 years ago hold their grandchildren&rsquo;s hands as they introduce them to an experience that is so much more than &ldquo;just a way to get from point A to point B&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Community Sponsorships Stoke the Holiday Express</p>
<p>All proceeds from the Holiday Express will go to the Oregon Rail Heritage Foundation. Fred Meyer Inc. is the event&rsquo;s corporate sponsor. The Holiday Express is also made possible through partnerships with the Oregon Pacific Railroad, Oaks Amusement Park and Portland Parks&nbsp;&amp; Recreation.</p>
<p>Train rides start Friday, November 28-30; December 5-7 and run through December 12-14.</p>

Its mission is to provide for the preservation and public enjoyment of Portland&rsquo;s historic steam locomotives, railroad equipment and artifacts; and to educate the public about Oregon&rsquo;s rich and diverse railroad history</p>

2014,509522,Portland Parks & Recreation Seeks Innovative Contractors to Help Build Two New Parks,2,,2014-11-14 19:37:32 UTC,2014-11-14 19:38:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Creative Firms Invited to Submit Proposals</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and the City of Portland are seeking skilled contractors who want to make a difference in the community. The City is issuing Requests for Proposals to help build a pair long-awaited parks in east Portland, Beech Park (approximately 16 acres off NE 126th Ave &amp; Beech St.) and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza (four acres off NE Halsey St between NE 104th &amp; 106th Aves). The goals of these solicitations are to engage firms committed to meeting workforce diversity goals (minorities and women), to hiring east Portland neighbors and businesses for project work, and to engage traditionally underserved communities in building both Beech Park and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza. Construction on both parks is anticipated to begin in early 2016.</p>
<p>The City will soon issue two separate Requests for Proposals (RFP's) for Construction Manager/General Contractor (CM/GC) for Beech Park and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza. All are welcome to submit bids. The City anticipates releasing the RFPs in the near future. Prior to that, a contractor fair will be held on Tuesday, November 18. At the fair, prospective firms will learn more about the park projects, features and scope of work involved, meet the PP&amp;R project managers, and have an opportunity to create partnerships with other contractors.</p>
<p>WHAT: Beech and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza Contractor Fair</p>
<p>WHERE: Oregon Assocation of Minority Entrepreneurs (OAME)&rsquo;s new headquarters</p>
<p>731 N Hayden Meadow Drive, Portland, OR 97217</p>
<p>WHEN: 3pm-5pm</p>
<p>Beech Park will provide a park for 965 east Portland families who do not currently have access to a park or natural area within &frac12; mile of their homes. Gateway Park &amp; Plaza will serve more than 800 new households.</p>
<p>&rdquo;We don&rsquo;t want to just build parks; we want to build community, and that&rsquo;s what we want our contractors to embrace too,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who designated Beech and Gateway Plaza Parks for development after careful consideration of community input. &ldquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park. That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area. Building Beech and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza represents a significant step in addressing historic inequities in parks in east Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we move forward on planning these highly-anticipated parks in east Portland, the City is looking for collaborative contractors who, every step of the way, are dedicated to making the community a part of the spaces they will enjoy,&rdquo; says Kia Selley, PP&amp;R Development and Assets Manager. &ldquo;The parks&rsquo; budget is from development revenue, rather than General Fund tax dollars. We want the contractors who commit to these projects to commit to the community as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The City&rsquo;s preference is for a general contractor to partner with a Minority, Women or Emerging Small Business (MWESB) firm on the park projects. The winning general contractors will be asked to provide a community benefits plan for each of the park projects.</p>
<p>The community benefits plan will include a description of how the contractor will meet:</p>
<p>Workforce Diversity Goals (Minority &amp; Women)East Portland Resident/Business HiringThe desire to engage traditionally underserved communities, including utilizing minority, women and emerging small business (MWESB) firms.</p>
<p>Fast Facts on Beech Park:</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>- Adjacent toShaverElementary School in theParkroseSchool District, in the Argay neighborhood ofNE Portland. It will feature grand views, a sports field and basketball court, accessible play and picnic areas, shelters, pedestrian and bike paths, parking, community gardens, and a fenced off-leash dog area.</p>
<p>Equity/Equal Access</p>
<p>-The park will serve nearly 965 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 49% of these households are ethnic minorities, and 23% are below the poverty level.</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>- Project cost is estimated at $11.8M, from Parks System Development Charges (not General Fund tax dollars). You can learn more about this park plan here.</p>
<p>Fast Facts on Gateway Park &amp; Plaza:</p>
<p>A partnership project with Portland Development Commission</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>-The 3.2-acre park will become a &ldquo;living room&rdquo; for the Gateway neighborhood, featuring accessible spaces and activities for all ages, including a plaza ready to accommodate a variety of events, festivals, and farmers' markets. As envisioned in the Master Plan, the park will also include flexible green spaces to accommodate picnic areas, accessible playground features and nature play. Harper&rsquo;s Playground is raising money to fund a universally-accessible play area at Gateway Park &amp; Plaza. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation supports these efforts and is soliciting public feedback on the design through the Gateway Park &amp; Plaza Project Advisory Committee and community forums. Harper&rsquo;s Playground raised the funds to construct PP&amp;R&rsquo;s first-ever universally-accessible playground in Arbor Lodge Park.</p>
<p>Equity/Equal Access</p>
<p>The park will serve more than 800 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 36% of these households are ethnic minorities, and 28% are below the poverty level.</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>The total project cost is $8.2 million, from System Development Charges (not General Fund tax dollars). The Portland Development Commission (PDC) will be contributing $1 million for the improvements, and is recruiting private investment to develop a building on NE Halsey adjacent to the new park. You can learn more about this park plan here.</p>
<p>Challenges Remain</p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist and to expanding other parks, many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades operating funding has been cut or remained flat forcing PP&amp;R to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the city. PP&amp;R has maintenance needs (http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/63265) totaling over $400 million. From aging playground replacements to leaking roofs, the list of needs is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p>The funding being used to create the two new parks in east Portland (SDC funding) is restricted to expanding capacity only. It cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is insufficient to address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of $480 million.</p>

2014,508602,Voters Overwhelmingly Approve Portland Parks Replacement Bond,2,,2014-11-05 17:28:30 UTC,2014-11-05 17:29:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Measure will raise up to $68 Million for critical park improvements,</em><br /><em>Tax Rates will not go up</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Unofficial preliminary results show that more than 72% of Portland voters approved Measure 26-159, the Parks Replacement Bond on the November 4th ballot. This bond measure replaces a similar bond from 1994 that expires next year, and provides funding for urgent major maintenance repairs across the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation system without increasing property tax rates. The YES vote allows Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) to make repairs and improvements needed citywide, and to prevent more playground and facility closures. Bond projects include (but are not limited to) fixing or improving:</p>
<p>-7 to 15 play areas currently closed, at risk of closure, or deficient, including Couch Creston, Kenton, Lents, Lynchview, the North Park Blocks, and Ventura Parks</p>
<p>-Bridge and trail repairs, including in Forest Park and along Springwater Corridor</p>
<p>-Community pools, including Matt Dishman, Peninsula, Grant</p>
<p>-Sellwood Park buildings, Rieke Field, Multnomah Arts Center, St. Johns Community Center</p>
<p>-Restrooms, roofs, other deficient structures and equipment</p>
<p>-Pioneer Courthouse Square failing structures, leaks, cracks</p>
<p>-Removing barriers to accessibility for people experiencing disabilities at numerous locations</p>
<p>-Park maintenance buildings to address worker safety, efficiency</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to the voters of Portland for approving the bond measure. It will help meet crucial needs across our parks system, while remaining sensitive to Portlanders&rsquo; ability to pay,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The funds from this bond won&rsquo;t completely close the gap our parks and facilities face, but will make a major difference. I will continue looking at ways to address the needs of our parks system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great day for parks, and for Portland,&rdquo; says Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the non-profit Portland Parks Foundation. &ldquo;We had a strong campaign, with financial and volunteer support from Portlanders of all walks of life and every community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bond will be subject to an oversight committee, annual reports, and audits. The measure replaces an expiring bond originally passed by voters in 1994 for park improvements, and will not raise park-related property tax rates. These rates are currently estimated at $0.0877 per $1000 of assessed value. In 2013, a household with a median assessed property value of $152,890 paid approximately $13 for the bond levy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portlanders have historically supported our parks system through bonds, and this is a time when our needs are most critical,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And this voter-approved replacement bond is a strong start to addressing the major maintenance needs across the city. I look forward to working with Commissioner Fritz on other funding options going forward, and to ensuring that our parks are available to all Portlanders, both now and in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) currently receives only $1.5 million annually in General Fund tax dollars for major maintenance across all of the Bureau&rsquo;s 209 city parks and 7800 acres of natural area. The Bureau has identified more than $365 million in major maintenance needs over the next 10 years across the city. The passage of the Parks Replacement Bond ensures that approximately $68 million in funding will pay for 31 of the most urgent capital improvement projects out of an identified list of 797. Additional projects may be added in coming years based on available funds, staff recommendations and community input.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will work with Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, the City&rsquo;s Office of Management &amp; Finance and City Council to put forward the first bond issuance by mid-year 2015. The Council will appoint a five-person oversight commitment responsible for annual reports. The Bureau expects money would be available to begin projects by July, 2015. The current bond project list is available at www.ParksReplacementBond.org.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to add a sincere &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to Portlanders for your vote of confidence in Portland Parks &amp; Recreation,&rdquo; adds Director Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Our work strives for better places and parks for all visitors. We look forward to rolling up our sleeves and delivering these important projects.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/508602
2014,508516,Fitness Enthusiast Designates Portland Parks & Recreation Rx Play Program to benefit from Fitness Milestone,2,,2014-11-04 21:54:21 UTC,2014-11-04 21:55:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Celebration of 1000 Classes</em></p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Rx Play program (for youth aged 6-12) will benefit from donations organized by a dedicated supporter, Susie Desmond. The retired teacher and Northwest Portland fitness enthusiast has chosen Rx Play to benefit from voluntary donations as she closes in on a milestone: her 1000th Barre3 fitness class.</p>
<p>On Saturday, November 15, Barre3 studio (1000 NW Marshall St) will accept donations for the Rx Play program at their 12:45pm drop-in class &ndash; which will mark the 1000th class Desmond has taken at the exercise studio. All donations will go to help children (who receive referrals from a doctor) take advantage of active recreation within PP&amp;R. Advance class registration is available; please contact Barre3 instructor Kelly at kelly.delaney@barre3.com Donations are also welcome without class participation.</p>
<p>WHAT: Donations to benefit Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Rx Play program</p>
<p>WHERE: 1000th Barre3 fitness class for Susie Desmond - 1000 NW Marshall</p>
<p>WHEN: Saturday, November 15, 12:45pm</p>
<p>Please register in advance with kelly.delaney@barre3.com &ndash; only 25 total spots are available, suggested donation of $20. Donations also accepted without class participation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned about Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Rx Play and thought, hey, that&rsquo;s my kind of thing,&rdquo; says Desmond. &ldquo;We need to be active and take care of ourselves, and we need to help kids to become more physically active and all the things the program is doing. I&rsquo;m excited to help Portland Parks &amp; Recreation grow the Rx Play program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desmond says she has improved her physical condition over the four years and is enjoying a much healthier lifestyle as she closes in on completing her 1000th class at Barre3, a combination of yoga, dance and cardio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a person who was left out of team sports, and laughed at because I have two left feet. But I&rsquo;ve had great success at Barre3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many young people have also had success with the Rx Play program, which has been active since 2008. Rx Play works via physician and health care referrals. Doctors, including pediatricians, &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; exercise to patients whom they believe will benefit from regular exercise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rx Play is designed to create a bridge between medical professionals who are encouraging regular physical activity, and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s community-based recreation systems,&rdquo; says Sue Glenn, North Zone Manager for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. &ldquo;Our citywide recreation centers, classes, camps, parks and facilities offer close-to-home physical activity opportunities for youth between the ages of 6-12 years in the Rx Play program&hellip;and, of course, people of any age. The goal is to help close the &lsquo;play gap&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through Kaiser Permanente, OHSU&rsquo;s Doernbecher Children&rsquo;s Hospital, NCNM and several school-based clinics, prescriptions are issued for youth (ages 6-12) to enroll in one of the many active recreation programs that PP&amp;R provides. The prescription is also sent to PP&amp;R to facilitate the transition between referral and action. A Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff member, who is fluent in Spanish, makes an outreach call to the child&rsquo;s family to facilitate registration. There are a wide variety of active recreation options available through Portland Parks &amp; Recreation community centers and programs.</p>
<p>Scholarships are available for those who need assistance, which makes Susie Desmond&rsquo;s help much appreciated as a welcome and tangible gift to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation simply could not do what it does without people like Susie,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;PP&amp;R benefits from nearly half a million hours per year from volunteers. It is community efforts and stewardship - such as what Susie has worked to deliver - that help PP&amp;R make a real difference in people&rsquo;s health and lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The November 15th Barre3 class is limited to 25 drop-in participants. No club membership is required and all donations received will go to the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Rx Play program. Those wishing to take part are asked to consider donating at least $20 - the standard rate for the class.</p>
<p>Registration is limited to 25 people but is open in advance: please contact Barre3 instructor Kelly at kelly.delaney@barre3.com</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I heard about Rx Play, I just thought, &lsquo;they get it&rsquo;&rdquo;, adds Desmond about Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and its partners. &ldquo;My experiences in public schools and in life have taught me it&rsquo;s our responsibility to share knowledge, and to try and make a difference for others in their lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To that end, Rx Play is a perfect fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>History of Rx Play</p>
<p>Planning for the Portland Rx Play project began in the fall of 2008 when the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (ORPD) staff began working in the Portland metropolitan area to develop a project addressing a recommendation in the SCORP report that identified a need for Oregon's recreation providers to work with the medical community to get recreation participation information into medical offices and physicians' physical activity referrals.</p>
<p>The Oregon Parks &amp; Recreation Department (OPRD)'s role in the Portland Rx Play project had been to identify key partners, provide overall project management and fund the pilot project research component. Founding project partners included Portland Parks and Recreation, Kaiser Permanente, Legacy Health System, Clarendon-Portsmouth School Health Center, Multnomah County Health Department, and the Oregon Health and Science University.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/508516

2014,507949,"City of Portland, Park Rangers, Reach Tentative Labor Agreement",2,,2014-10-29 21:55:50 UTC,2014-10-29 21:56:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>The City of Portland and Laborers Local 483 (LL483) have reached a tentative agreement after contract negotiations involving Portland Park Rangers. The parties entered into the recently-concluded negotiations in order to craft a mutually beneficial agreement over wages, hours and working conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Park Rangers serve admirably as the goodwill ambassadors of our parks and natural areas, and I am pleased we have come to this agreement,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We thank our Rangers for continuing to provide a positive presence for all visitors to Portland parks and park facilities, for doing an excellent job in offering social services to those in need, and for keeping their sharp eyes out for any potential problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highlights of the new contract include:</p>
<p>-Both seasonal (those who work up to a maximum of 1400 hours annually) and full-time Rangers will receive a pay raise to keep them on par with competitive salaries.</p>
<p>-Starting Jan 1, 2015, seasonal Rangers will be eligible for health care benefits under the City of Portland&rsquo;s Seasonal Workers Plan.</p>
<p>-Seasonal Rangers who perform satisfactorily will be given priority to return to work in the upcoming year if they wish.</p>
<p>-Full-time Rangers gain seniority rights.</p>
<p>-Seasonal Rangers gain discipline and grievance rights similar to the established system used for the City&rsquo;s seasonal maintenance workers.</p>
<p>&rdquo;Both the City and Rangers have an interest in and commitment to a well-trained work force and safe work environment,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;I want to commend and thank our rangers for continuing to distinguish themselves by their work ethic, dedication, and compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agreement is expected to be formally signed on Friday, October 31, and will run through June 30, 2017.</p>
<p>Rangers serve multiple roles by providing information, helping solve park user conflicts, and enforcing City Code such as dog leash/scoop laws, proper use of park permits, prohibitions against camping, alcohol consumption, and other park rules.</p>
<p>Rangers are non-sworn (law enforcement) officials who are given the authority under City Code to enforce park rules and issue park exclusions, if necessary. All Rangers are trained to assess a given situation and use verbal persuasion and problem-solving skills to gain voluntary compliance. If warranted, they call police or other responders to address the park concern.</p>
<p>In 2012, PP&amp;R expanded the Park Ranger program to provide service in the central business district/downtown area year-round during the day and early evening shifts. The Rangers maintain security in 16 downtown/central city parks and work closely with other partners such as the Portland Police Bureau, Multnomah County, the Office of Neighborhood Involvement, JOIN, and other social service providers to address needs and issues that arise in downtown parks.</p>
<p>For non-emergency park-related problems or special situations, the public may call the Park Ranger hotline at 503-823-1637.</p>

2014,507318,Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz Announces More Improvements to east Portland Properties,2,,2014-10-23 15:58:45 UTC,2014-10-23 15:57:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revenue from Development to Fund Improvements at Leach Botanical Garden and Clatsop Butte Park</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Representatives from City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz&rsquo;s office and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff announced at the East Portland Action Plan meeting tonight (Wednesday, October 22) that Commissioner Fritz has allocated more than $1 million in revenue from System Development Charges to fund improvements at Leach Botanical Garden and Clatsop Butte Park. These Portland Parks &amp; Recreation properties are the latest east Portland park sites designated for improvements by Commissioner Fritz. In 2014, Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Director Mike Abbat&eacute; have announced approximately $22M in investments in east Portland parks (please see attached summary document for details). From 2009 through September 2014, PP&amp;R has dedicated approximately $31.2M in System Development Charges to provide parks facilities in east Portland.</p>
<p>Revenue from System Development Charges (SDCs), which is collected as fees on new construction rather than tax dollars, will fund the major improvements at Leach Botanical Garden as well as modest interim facilities at Clatsop Butte Park. SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased civic infrastructure required when new homes and businesses are built. By state law, SDCs can only be used to expand capacity, not to fix existing parks facilities or to fund operational services.</p>
<p>The SDC investment at Leach Botanical Garden includes approximately $1M in improvements, including Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access, to areas including the upper garden at the regional Leach attraction, located off SE Foster Road in the Pleasant Valley neighborhood. Pedestrian and vehicle access projects will be prioritized. The specific projects will be determined in partnership with the non-profit Leach Garden Friends. Portland Development Commission (PDC) is partnering by contributing additional funds of up to $1.1M towards the upper garden&rsquo;s project design and construction over the next five years. PDC has already contributed approximately $150,000 in schematic design work. On Friday, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation expects to acquire more property for the garden to display plants native to the Northwest, but from remote parts of the region. The additional 1.36 acres will give more people the opportunity to experience botanical treasures, to take classes, and to participate in events in a setting apart from the bustle of urban life, according to Leach Botanical Garden Executive Director David Porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The improvements at Leach Botanical Garden will make significant improvements to a beautiful garden; and will be enjoyed by individuals and families from around the region, and especially those who live in East Portland"", says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. ""Removing barriers that enhance access for people with disabilities in the historic Leach Botanical Garden is another way to make sure all Portlanders can enjoy this amazing garden gem.""</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leach Botanical Garden is a unique botanical and cultural attraction,&rdquo; says Leach Garden Friends&rsquo; board president, Linda Morrow. &ldquo;We represent the character of the Pacific Northwest realized through plants, water, art and discovery. This support from Commissioner Fritz through Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is an important step to carrying on the legacy of east Portland civic leaders, John and Lilla Leach, who were visionary in giving their botanical garden to be a public space of respite and beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Clatsop Butte Park project provides an opportunity to enhance a park site atop a butte in east Portland, at SE 152nd Ave &amp; Belmore St. (also in the Pleasant Valley community), with views of downtown Portland, Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams and Mount St. Helens. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will begin improvements on the 43-acre Clatsop Butte property by developing an interim wood chip trail, benches and signage to encourage neighborhood enjoyment of this important east Portland asset until funds are available to build out the Master Plan developed with the community. Approximately $100,000 in SDC funds will provide improvements primarily benefiting an estimated 178 nearby households. Construction is expected to begin in October 2014, with completion before the end of the year.</p>
<p>About parks in east Portland</p>
<p>East Portland was incorporated into the city of Portland later than many other areas. Two out of every five households in this part of town do not have easy access to a City of Portland park, in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area. The east Portland area has experienced significant population growth, and now 40% of Portland&rsquo;s families with children live in east Portland. Demand for recreational services is high, and closing this &ldquo;play gap&rdquo; is a priority for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Commissioner Fritz.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/507318

<p>&ldquo;The efforts of volunteers and the No Ivy League are essential to the health of our beautiful parks and natural areas,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;As stewards of our parks and natural areas, we appreciate the engagement of our community partners to remove this invasive plant. The grassroots efforts of our neighbors have had a visible, positive effect on our green spaces, and I look forward to these efforts continuing - even bigger and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The non-native English ivy (Hedera hibernica and Hedera helix) is a pervasive and unwelcome guest in our parks and natural areas. The vines overcome native plant species, and mature ivy vines may threaten trees in many of our forests.</p>
<p>Ivy removal work parties run from 9:00 AM to noon, followed by a gathering for food and celebration at Lower Macleay Park, NW 29th &amp; Upshur, from 12:30-2:00 PM. The celebration will feature free T-shirts while they last, words from our civic leaders and a chance to meet with other volunteers</p>
<p>All are welcome to show support for our native ecosystem by joining a work party at one of the many sites throughout the region or by registering to host your own No Ivy Day site. Please check the No Ivy Day link for more information here.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation City Nature experts say it is important to remove maturing ivy during the fall to reduce the amount of seed produced through the winter, slowing its spread to unaffected areas. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Terwilliger Wildlands, Marquam Nature Park and Forest Park have seen vast improvements in tree health in places where ivy was recently cleared.</p>
<p>During last year&rsquo;s No Ivy Day, more than 120 volunteers cleared ivy from nearly 200 trees, and pulled over 48,000 square feet of vines. The hope is to accomplish even more this year.</p>
<p>All volunteers are invited to take part in a celebration after the citywide work parties featuring lunch, free T-shirts and inspiring words from City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.</p>

2014,506640,Portland Parks & Recreation Takes Over Management of Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center,2,,2014-10-15 22:05:34 UTC,2014-10-15 22:05:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>For the past four years, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Ethos, Inc., a non-profit music-focused arts organization, have partnered with other local multi-cultural arts organizations to operate the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center (IFCC), located at 5340 North Interstate Avenue in Portland. Effective December 31, 2014, Ethos will return general management responsibilities of the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center to the City of Portland. Per Ethos&rsquo; mission, Ethos&rsquo; board and staff have agreed to redirect resources to low-income kids living in underserved communities in Oregon. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will assume management responsibilities at IFCC moving forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank Ethos for their four years of partnership at IFCC,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Supporting the arts is a key part of what makes our city so livable. We want to continue the vibrancy and tradition of the historic firehouse and to foster more multicultural, diverse programming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>""Ethos has been honored to partner with some of Portland's most dynamic arts organizations at the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center,&rdquo; says Jedidiah Chavez, Executive Director of Ethos. &ldquo;As we refocus our mission to meet the changing landscape of arts education in Oregon, Ethos&rsquo; board and staff have agreed to redirect resources to low-income kids living in underserved communities including isolated, rural towns in Oregon.""</p>
<p>The Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center is a former firehouse that has been renovated into an arts facility consisting of a dance studio, art galleries, and a theatre, all of which are ADA accessible. Since 1982, the IFCC facility has provided a venue for multicultural arts programming in Portland. Over the years, IFCC has served as an art and cultural center, a theatre, an event space, a summer camp location, a community center, an after-school program facility, a gallery space, a dance studio, a venue for performing artists, and an educational facility for the arts.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is committed to honoring the rich tradition of this historic space and will be working closely with the public to plan programming that celebrates multiculturalism and community access at IFCC. PP&amp;R has begun the process of reaching out to current users, and any interested parties in reserving space after January 1, 2015 at IFCC should contact Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Phil Lewis, <a href=""mailto:Phil.Lewis@portlandoregon.gov"">Phil.Lewis@portlandoregon.gov</a></p>

2014,505495,Portland Parks & Recreation Opens City’s First Permanent Nature Playground at Westmoreland Park,2,,2014-10-07 20:05:57 UTC,2014-10-07 20:04:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s first-ever permanent nature-based play area is now open at Westmoreland Park, SE McLoughlin Blvd and SE Bybee Blvd. The Westmoreland natural play area is the first such permanent playscape across the PP&amp;R system and features play elements made of logs and boulders, sand &amp; water play, plants, hills, and opportunities for building with &ldquo;loose parts&rdquo; such as branches, sticks, pinecones and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A recent US Army Corps of Engineers project (in conjunction with the Bureau of Environmental Serves and PP&amp;R) restored Crystal Springs Creek to its natural flow through Westmoreland Park. This project meant that Westmoreland Park&rsquo;s aging playground had to be moved away from the restored floodplain to a more desirable location on higher ground. The equipment was outdated and needed to be replaced. Community input showed a strong enthusiasm for the idea of nature play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a unique and wonderful project to encourage children to play creatively and connect with nature,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The new Westmoreland play area is a site where people of all ages can spend much-needed time outdoors, and enjoy unstructured play, away from apps and TV screens, to provide valuable and hands-on educational and social experiences. This special place is sure to create treasured memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A celebration of the renovated park, the restoration of Crystal Springs Creek, and the return of salmon to the city will be held on Saturday, October 25, from 11am-4pm. Please see this link</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/article/505279"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/505279</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;for more info on that day&rsquo;s program, which will include a Native American blessing, tours of the rejuvenated park, games, crafts, and inter-tribal activities. The event will be free and open to all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new, nature-based playscape is a pilot project for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Nature-Based Play Initiative, with a goal of creating settings in developed parks that encourage creative play and interaction with nature and natural materials. PP&amp;R continues to explore the concept of nature play, a movement that is building support in the public, with educators and with parents. A natural play environment connects children and families with nature. Natural materials increase environmental awareness and appreciation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s mission includes stewardship of the environment,&rdquo; notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;And we hope that Westmoreland&rsquo;s new play area inspires connection to the environment and environmental stewardship. Children are innately fascinated by nature. We are proud to offer a natural play area that creates opportunities for children to explore, discover, take challenges and risks, and learn. These are the types of play which are essential to healthy development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Westmoreland Park&rsquo;s Natural Play Area features include:</p>
<p>Creek Mound &ndash; a concrete stream channel with willow tunnels, water pumps, mazes where children can manipulate the water&rsquo;s flow, and a large sand play area.</p>
<p>Forest Mound &ndash; features logs tilted at varying inclines for climbing and adventure, a hill slide build on a natural embankment, and boulder scrambles.</p>
<p>Mountain Mound - made of natural boulders and logs featuring varying degrees of difficulty, for climbing, balancing and unstructured play.</p>
<p>Log Climbers &ndash; log segment sculptures for climbing; this feature calls to mind tree climbing.</p>
<p>Creative Building &ndash; building frames for creative play with &ldquo;loose parts&rdquo;, such as branches, pinecones, etc., for building forts, tents, etc.</p>
<p>Crystal Springs Interpretive Markers &ndash; inspired by the recently restored namesake creek that runs through the park. Basalt column stones are engraved with poetic phrases, telling the story of Crystal Springs.</p>
<p>Enchanted Forest - a grove of Giant Sequoia trees serves as the centerpiece of an area for free and imaginative play.</p>
<p>Grassy picnic area - grassy mounds for sitting and picnicking</p>
<p>Park benches - log benches and standard park benches.</p>
<p>Split rail fencing &ndash; low fencing to help keep younger children within the boundaries of the play area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revitalized Crystal Springs Creek inspired the theme of the new Westmoreland Park play area designed by the landscape architecture firm, GreenWorks PC, in conjunction with public artist Adam Kuby. Kuby worked integrally with the design team to develop the concepts of several of the primary play features through the City of Portland Percent for Art program, administered by the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council (RACC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why Westmoreland?</p>
<p>Though PP&amp;R has had many requests to incorporate nature play into park land, the Westmoreland Park play area is the first large-scale natural play area project the bureau has built. Spring Garden Park in southwest Portland has a nature play area, designed to be a temporary site (though some elements of nature play may be incorporated into the playground&rsquo;s design as the park is developed). The Westmoreland Park natural play area came about from a combination of projects, needs, and funding. The Westmoreland Stream Restoration project (funded and facilitated through the US Army Corps of Engineers) was completed in July of 2014. The design for the stream restoration required relocating part of the former, outdated playground away from the stream bank and floodplain and up to higher ground. That opened up the opportunity to provide the park a completely new play area. The themes and goals of nature play fit perfectly with the environmental restoration project. Public outreach and input made it clear that neighbors were supportive of the concept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The research proving the developmental and environmental stewardship benefits of children having a strong connection with nature have grown dramatically over the past 15-20 years,&rdquo; says the PP&amp;R project manager for Westmoreland Park&rsquo;s playground, Sandra Burtzos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that people who work with children have known for decades, but now a growing body of research is documenting it. This nature play area is somewhere on the continuum between learning and playing in actual nature, and a playground. Located within an urban park setting, it is one stepping stone to reconnecting children and families back to nature. I am most excited to see the multi-generational play that natural play areas are so much more conducive to than a typical play structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Metro&rsquo;s voter-approved 2006 natural areas (Nature in Neighborhoods) bond measure provided $150,000 in funding for the Westmoreland Park natural play area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The remaining project cost (approximately $900,000) is being funded by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation General Fund tax dollars and by System Development Charges from new construction in Portland. The project was constructed by three different contractors working closely together: Cascadian Landscapers served as the City&rsquo;s General Contractor, Adam Kuby &amp; Stone Sculptures Inc. installed the log and boulder play features, and Oregon Log Homes fabricated the log play elements out of salvaged trees that had to be removed from other park sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Nature Play</p>
<p>Richard Louv&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Last Child in the Woods: Nature Deficit Disorder&rdquo; was first published in 2005 and helped start a nationwide movement &ldquo;No Child Left Inside&rdquo; and investment into creating nature-based play areas such as what PP&amp;R has just completed at Westmoreland Park.</p>
<p><a href=""http://richardlouv.com/books/last-child/children-nature-movement/"">http://richardlouv.com/books/last-child/children-nature-movement/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is Natural Play? &ndash; Oregon Natural Play Initiative, a group of professionals who have been working together to support and promote natural play in Oregon, says:</p>
<p>Natural Play challenges and fascinates children and teaches them about the wonders and intricacies of the natural world while they explore and play within it. It is intuitive and unstructured, constructive (or deconstructive), and timeless, encouraging interaction with natural materials, features, indigenous vegetation, and creative landforms. Natural Play is often a blend of materials and experiences to create purposely complex interplays of natural and environmental objects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free play, time spent outdoors, artistic expression and socialization opportunities are invaluable to the physical and psychological health of children,&rdquo; says Sandra Burtzos, PP&amp;R project manager for Westmoreland Park&rsquo;s playground. &ldquo;Outdoor play facilitates creativity, fosters social connections, and cultivates children&rsquo;s desire to learn. Nature play areas promote multi-generational play; they are places where parents, grandparents and other caregivers can enjoy interacting with and playing creatively with children - more so than on most manufactured play structures. And many people have fond memories of building things out of sticks, or of playing in and with sand and water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children are innately fascinated by nature. By learning appreciation of nature and natural elements, they develop life-long stewardship of our natural resources. Left with open space and imagination, they&rsquo;ll become more agile, more creative, better at solving problems, better at assessing risks, and better at entertaining themselves.&rdquo;</p>

2014,501592,Portland Parks & Recreation Acquires Gateway Green Property,2,,2014-08-28 19:10:19 UTC,2014-08-27 22:33:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Bureau Plans to Develop 25-Acre Site for Off-Road Biking</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An island of unused land at the confluence of two freeways takes another step towards becoming a new city park in east Portland, and a regional off-road biking destination.</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=501641"" alt=""Cyclist"" width=""400"" height=""266.4"" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has acquired the 25-acre Gateway Green property, with plans, in concert with Friends of Gateway Green, to build an off-road biking facility on the land. Portland City Council unanimously today authorized the land transfer from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) using funds from System Development Charges (SDCs), not tax dollars. SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built. $19,300 in SDCs will fund the land acquisition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful to take the next step on Gateway Green, an open space long envisioned for outdoor recreation,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The location between I-205 and I-84 will boost Portland&rsquo;s visibility as a world-class bike-friendly city, and is a tremendous use of the underutilized land. The driving force on Gateway Green has been the persistent grassroots effort. I admire how neighbors and cyclists have come together to see their vision for Gateway Green move forward. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is committed to partnering with community advocates to make Gateway Green a regional gathering place for families. It will be an important addition to our infrastructure that enhances wildlife habitat and recreation for children, families and seniors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland cycling community has long asked for more recreational opportunities across our system,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Gateway Green will provide a place where bicyclists of all ages can gather, develop their skills and enjoy the outdoors, all while increasing their physical health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brainchild of two dedicated community members, Linda Robinson and Ted Gilbert, Gateway Green has blossomed into a regional project that involves and is supported by multiple partners, including ODOT, PP&amp;R, Oregon State Parks, Metro, the City of Maywood Park, bicycle, environmental, and neighborhood groups, who are working together to realize the original vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously this is a huge step for the Gateway Green project -- and an exciting day for me,&rdquo; says Linda Robinson, a notable park advocate for more than two decades. &ldquo;'Patient persistence' -- that's my personal motto. And this is a perfect example of how patient persistence can pay off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation thanks Linda, and Ted Gilbert, for their years of advocacy towards making Gateway Green a reality,&rdquo; adds PP&amp;R Director Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Developing this site will strengthen our platinum bike city status and extend our reputation as a city that wisely converts 20th century transportation space into 21st century gathering spots that provide and promote health and recreation opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing Gateway Green was included as an Oregon Solutions project in 2009 and includes support from Governor Kitzhaber&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action by Portland City Council successfully transfers 25 acres of ODOT property to the city, for the creation of a world-class recreational facility,&rdquo; said ODOT Region 1 Interim Region Manager Rian Windsheimer. &ldquo;This important milestone follows years of work by the Friends of Gateway Green, ODOT, the Governor&rsquo;s office and the City of Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The non-profit Friends of Gateway Green (FOGG) hopes to raise about $1.6 million by the end of 2015 to validate a Metro &ldquo;Nature in Neighborhoods&rdquo; grant. Donations may be made at <a href=""http://www.gatewaygreenpdx.org/"">http://www.gatewaygreenpdx.org/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background on Gateway Green</p>
<p>In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park. That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area. Constructing a new park on the land at Gateway Green will benefit an area that does not having ready access to parks or natural area. It will provide a much anticipated urban oasis for the community and enhanced wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a significant step in addressing historic inequities in parks in East Portland,&rdquo; says Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who earlier this year also allocated System Development Charges (not tax dollars) to build two new parks in east Portland. Beech Park and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza combined are more than 20 acres, and will serve more than 1800 families who currently do not have easy access to a park or natural area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The acquisition of Gateway Green will add to that access. Its future as a regional off-road biking destination has the potential to transform the Gateway area and to encourage its growth. Gateway Green will become a desirable gathering space and to permanently stamp the larger Portland region on the map as a national destination for bicycling enthusiasts. It will strengthen Portland&rsquo;s Platinum Bike City status in the spirit of when the City removed a highway to build Tom McCall Waterfront Park in the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R is fully participating in the Gateway Green project. In 2010, the City agreed to maintain most of the site, in collaboration with our partner, the Friends of Gateway Green. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is the first major financial contributor to the Friends&rsquo; effort, and will leverage that commitment towards further private and public investment in the project.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chinook wawa is the language commonly used by the original people of this area,&rdquo; says Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;The name fits well with our goal of a name that invokes a sense of community and unity. &lsquo;K&#688;unamokwst&rsquo; reflects the community&rsquo;s &ndash; and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s - values of inclusion, diversity, and fun for all ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;K&#688;unamokwst means &lsquo;together&rsquo;,&rdquo; notes Jon A. George, Tribal Councilman from the Grand Ronde Tribal Council. &ldquo;And that is what this beautiful green space will enable all of us to do, to come together to honor the original people of this place, the Clackamas and Multnomah people - our ancestors. It is a name that honors the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, the Willamette Valley Treaty Tribe, and it is a name that honors our community of Portland. Together we will enjoy the beauty and protect the health of this place, just as our ancestors did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has begun construction on park, with completion expected in the spring of 2015. The new park will serve 1488 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fritz adds that she is proud to continue former Park Commissioner Nick Fish&rsquo;s work to provide the newest neighborhood park in a park-deficient area, one being built with strong community support and extensive neighborhood involvement. She was joined at tonight&rsquo;s community celebration by members of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, Commissioner Fish, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, a consultant team led by Greenworks PC, Cully Association of Neighbors (CAN), Hacienda CDC, and other partners, neighbors and PP&amp;R staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout K&#688;unamokwst Park&rsquo;s planning and design process, care has been taken to include the whole community. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation worked to have Spanish-language translators at open houses, committee meetings, and all other occasions. All park-related documents were translated into Spanish in order to remove longstanding barriers to participation. Planning for the park began in February, 2012, with a 12-member advisory committee. This included focus groups in partnership with the Ortiz Center and Rigler SUN School. Most recently, Hacienda CDC Expresiones worked to involve kids from under-represented communities in designing some of the exciting park features. Verde and Greenworks, PC, have participated extensively with these endeavors as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new K&#688;unamokwst Park will be 2.4 acres in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1488 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by K&#688;unamokwst Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The K&#688;unamokwst project cost is approx. $2.5 million, paid for via SDCs (System Development Charges). SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built.&nbsp; PP&amp;R purchased the property &ndash; almost two and a half acres - in 2009 to help fulfill the need for park and open space within the Cully Neighborhood.&nbsp; This will be the first developed park in the Cully Neighborhood, an area noted to be park-deficient. With construction beginning now, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation expects it to be ready for play in spring 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>K&#688;unamokwst Park features include:</p>
<p>A traditional children&rsquo;s&rsquo; playground AND</p>

<p>K&#688;unamokwst PARK - PROJECT BACKGROUND</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/61985"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/61985</a></p>
<p>The Cully Neighborhood is home to more than 13,000 residents. Cully is a culturally diverse urban neighborhood with a mix of commercial and relatively dense residential development. The northern edge of the neighborhood is the Columbia Slough with its associated lakes and slough extensions. Generally the northern portion of the neighborhood is industrial with a few commercial uses and older homes. The central and southern portions of the neighborhood are residential, with small pockets of commercial development. The major open space landmarks are the 68+ acre Rose City cemetery, Thomas Cully Park, Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, and Colwood Golf Course. The commercial center of the neighborhood is at the intersection of NE Cully, NE 60, and NE Prescott. This five-way intersection is a commercial node with a grocery store and other commercial businesses (1992 Cully Neighborhood Plan).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Werbin Property Master Plan was a collaborative effort between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the Cully community, and the Project Advisory Committee. The plan is a vision for the project site and a framework to guide the preparation of detailed design documents for the development of the park. Given the amount of public outreach that has occurred on the project as well as acceptance of the master plan by City Council, PP&amp;R will not entertain alternative design concepts. Any significant change in design will require written approval from the Owner&rsquo;s Representative and substantive changes will necessitate public information meeting(s) per the direction of the PP&amp;R Project Manager.</p>

2014,498057,"Portland Parks & Recreation, Partners, Secure Major Grant for Cully Park:",2,,2018-05-29 18:56:25 UTC,2014-07-24 22:23:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Project Spearheaded by Verde</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), Verde and the Let Us Build Cully Park! coalition announce they&rsquo;ve secured a major Oregon Parks and Recreation Department (OPRD) grant towards the building of Cully Park. The OPRD has just awarded $473,000 via a Local Government Grant Program (LGGP) grant towards the construction of the future park at NE 72nd Avenue north of Killingsworth. The grant is a significant boost for the unique public-private partnership that is making</p>
<p>Cully Park possible, resulting in a developed, 25-acre park in the Cully neighborhood - an area deficient in parks and green spaces.</p>
<p><strong>405 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by Cully Park.</strong></p>
<p>Let Us Build Cully Park! (LUBCP), a non-profit coalition of more than 15 community-based organizations, has raised more than $3.5 million dollars for the park&rsquo;s construction. The OPRD grant will add an additional $473,000 towards building the park. Part of the $3.5 million came from Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s February 2014 designation of $1.25 million in System Development Charges (SDC) &ndash; money raised from development fees, rather than General Fund tax dollars &ndash; to support Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s construction. SDCs are funds paid by development to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cully neighborhood is unique; it is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Portland, perhaps the state,&rdquo; notes City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Cully neighbors don&rsquo;t currently have sufficient access to parks or natural areas. We are delighted that OPRD saw the need for this major grant, and the benefits it will provide. The unique public-private partnership between PP&amp;R, Verde and Let Us Build Cully Park shows that this agreement leverages public investment to go even further. The grant provides us with the funds necessary to build the park. Verde and the LUBCP coalition provided have the extensive organizing and economic development to support both the community and the park effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is great news for the many diverse people and organizations that call Cully home,&rdquo; says Alan Hip&oacute;lito, Executive Director of Verde, the lead organization in the Let Us Build Cully Park! coalition. &ldquo;With this award, OPRD has made powerful investment in a community-based project. We are excited by the continuing commitment by the State of Oregon to redevelop this former landfill, and are very thankful for our great partnership with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Together with these and other partners, we are bringing the benefits of park-building to the Cully community: open space for our neighborhood, environmental education for our youth, contracts for our local businesses, and dollars into the pockets of low-income people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>60% of residents in the future Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s service area are people belonging to traditionally underserved communities, and 45% are considered low income (annual household income of $40,000 or less). In Central Northeast Portland, nearly two out of five households are not within &frac12; mile of a park or natural area. Data show that Central Northeast is second only to the area east of I-205 in terms of the greatest need for parks and natural areas in Portland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cully is home to some of the most dedicated and motivated community advocates in the City,&rdquo; adds Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;I am proud to work with our partners towards our shared goal of completing Cully Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>History of Cully Park</strong></p>
<p>The Cully Park property was a sand and gravel mine, then a construction landfill, and is now in the process of becoming a park. The City of Portland purchased the 25-acre Thomas Cully Park property in 2002.</p>
<p>Working with the community, in 2008 PP&amp;R created a master plan for Cully Park to guide future developments. This master plan was adopted by City Council. In 2011, PP&amp;R was approached by Verde, in coordination with the &lsquo;Let Us Build Cully Park!&rsquo; coalition (a coalition of more than 15 community-based organizations) to partner with them in a new model to develop Cully Park. In June 2012, Portland City Council approved an agreement between Verde and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for developing the park.&nbsp; Since that time, Verde has successfully raised more than $3.5 million dollars (including in-kind donations) to implement Phase I of the Thomas Cully Master Plan (Thomas Cully Park will be built in multiple phases). Their total estimate for completing Phase I is $6,671,845. The community garden at the site was installed in 2012, and remaining improvements planned by Let Us Build Cully Park! include pathways, dog off-leash area, playgrounds and picnic areas, intertribal gathering garden area, youth soccer field, basketball court, parking lot, restroom, north slope restoration, and improvements to NE 72nd.</p>
<p>Implementation of Phase II of the master plan would include construction of multiple sports fields, improvements to access from NE Killingsworth, and building a parking area off of NE Killingsworth &amp; 75th.&nbsp; Students from nearby Scott School helped design the adjacent NE 72nd Ave. Community Garden, which opened in 2012, and have had input on the park&rsquo;s playground design.&nbsp; A newly proposed feature, the Inter-Tribal Gathering Garden, offers unique opportunities for honoring and educating about indigenous cultural values and ethics through holistic, culturally-significant garden design and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Remain</strong></p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist and to expanding other parks, many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, operating funding has been cut or remained flat forcing PP&amp;R to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the city. PP&amp;R has unfunded maintenance needs totaling about $365 million over a ten-year period. From aging playground replacements to leaking roofs, the list of needs is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p>System Development Charges (SDCs) used to create new parks are restricted to expanding capacity only. They cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. SDCs are insufficient to address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of $480 million.</p>
<p>Today, Commissioner Fritz will ask Portland City Council to refer a Parks Replacement Bond to voters, in order to fund critical system-wide improvements. The current parks bond is expiring; a replacement bond would fund the most severe needs of the park system &ndash; without raising tax rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investing in new parks now is the right thing to do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;For more than a hundred years, Portlanders built our parks system through a series of legacy investments. Now, we don&rsquo;t have funding for the needs in growing neighborhoods, nor for maintenance of existing facilities. It&rsquo;s time for Portland to begin to think about what our legacy will be. Will it be a legacy of increased equity and increased commitment to our region&rsquo;s uniquely beautiful parks and natural areas? I hope so.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/498057

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is proud to present this year&rsquo;s Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament on Thursday, July 3, and Friday July 4, 2014, at Delta Park. The opening ceremonies begin at 9am on July 3, featuring Bhutanese priest Khada Mishra, diversity advocates and special guests including Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT: The 5th Annual Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament</p>
<p>WHERE: Delta Park, N. Denver Ave. &amp; Martin Luther King</p>
<p>WHEN: Thursday, July 3 and Friday, July 4, 2014; 9am-5pm</p>
<p>Opening Ceremonies begin at 9am Thursday. 17 boys&rsquo; teams and six girls&rsquo; teams are taking part in the 2014 tournament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament brings together 350 youth originally from more 22 countries. Many were refugees or are newcomers to both Portland and the US. Crafting a handmade plastic soccer ball is one of the most common ways that youth in refugee camps and poor communities are able enjoy the sport, often in harsh conditions. Eder Mutara, a Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament organizer and player originally from the Congo, recalls his experiences in a Zambian refugee camp known as Mayukwayukwa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living in a refugee camp makes one resourceful. Every day we would play with a ball we crafted from plastic bags and twine,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was just as much a part of my day as mealtime. The best thing about this type of ball is that it can be played in any kind of field such as on dry ground, on the street, on the grass field, and pretty much everywhere. In my native language we call a plastic soccer ball &ldquo;Tshibulundu&rdquo;. By playing with a Tshibulundu, I was able to keep my mind way from thinking of not having enough food and pure water. I was able to stay out of trouble and focus on making the right decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the camp we went without clean water, and often not enough food. People were depressed. I believed that there was hope, and one way I tried to encourage those around me was by getting them involved in sports such as soccer and track. We were without shoes, balls or water to drink. I relied on the spirits of dozens of youth who were able to focus on something other than their immediate situation for a while. Eventually, I moved to America, where I&rsquo;ve tried to use the same leadership skills learned in soccer to build community by organizing this large tournament through Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&ldquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mutara is entering his fifth year as a Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament participant. He spent several years in a refugee camp before moving to Portland with his mother and two brothers. In the fall, he will attend Western Oregon University on a scholarship. Eder speaks seven languages, wrestles, plays football, soccer and plans to study accounting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament will be held on July 3 and 4 at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Delta Park. The tournament and its associated programs engage underserved and underrepresented immigrant and refugee youth who&rsquo;ve come to Portland from all over the world, representing nearly two dozen ethnicities and cultures. This event is an important celebration of diversity, family, partnership, and integration in Portland. There are 16 boys&rsquo; teams and five girls&rsquo; teams taking part in the 2014 tournament. Registration is closed for this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we talk about &lsquo;closing the play gap&rsquo; here in Portland, we mean providing for people who need parks, recreation and play the most,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament and its related activities help foster awareness about what our city offers for people new to Portland &ndash; athletic, educational, career opportunities and more - through the international language of football - also known as soccer here in Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament is about much more than a game,&rdquo; says Polo Catalani of the Office of Equity and Human Rights. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about investing our efforts now to embrace the changing face of our city, about integrating people new to both Portland and the United States into our society and our quality of life, and about showing them how to take part in democracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catalani notes that one in five Portlanders are now foreign-born, and nearly half of area public school students belong to ethnic minority families. In many underserved north and east Portland neighborhoods, these percentages are even higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament helps youth get past the challenges of being a teen, and a newcomer to Portland. It fosters peace, understanding, and the embracing of other cultures.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing could be more American.</p>

<p>WHAT: A Town Hall discussion about how the Parks Replacement Bond will help address urgent maintenance needs with no increased tax rates for Portlanders. Co-hosted by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Portland Parks Foundation</p>

<p>Please join us for a discussion about how the Parks Replacement Bond will help address urgent maintenance needs with no increased tax rates for Portlanders. Get your questions answered and give your input to Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the last century, Portlanders created and have maintained our parks system through a series of capital investments (bonds and levies). However, our park structures and facilities have finite life spans, and require ongoing investment to remain safe and accessible. As Portland&rsquo;s existing parks bond&mdash;approved in 1994&mdash;is paid off in 2015, we have the opportunity to address critical park needs without increasing tax rates, by referring a Parks Replacement Bond to voters now.</p>
<p>A recent survey shows that more than 65 percent of Portlanders are supportive of a Replacement Bond which would not increase tax rates and would fund some of the most critical repairs to our parks system.</p>
<p>Get your questions answered on this unique opportunity at the Parks Replacement Bond Town Hall.</p>
<p>For more info, please visit ParksReplacementBond.org</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>A recent Portland Parks &amp; Recreation survey shows support for Parks Replacement Bond: respondents strongly in favor of funding critical parks repairs without increasing tax rates.In order to assess support for a possible parks replacement bond, Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commissioned DHM Research to conduct a representative telephone survey of Portlanders. The survey shows that, support begins at 48% but once Portlanders find out that a replacement bond would not increase tax rates and would fund some of the most critical repairs to our parks system, more than 65% are supportive. Replacing the expiring bond would generate an estimated $56-$68 million to fund critical repairs, such as:</p>
<p>The replacement of deteriorating playgrounds, including the Couch Park structure serving the Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC) Portland Public school, which recently had to be removed due to potentially catastrophic failureReopening and stabilizing trails such as the closed Maple Trail in Forest ParkRepairing community swimming pools to prevent emergency closures and extend usable lifeEnsuring that more facilities and natural areas are safe and accessible to all, including people with disabilitiesMaking repairs and protecting worker safety at Mount Tabor YardMaking much-needed structural repairs to Pioneer Courthouse SquareMaking other major maintenance repairs like restoring restrooms, fixing leaking roofs, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homeowners currently pay $.0877/$1000 on their assessed property value (AV) for the expiring 1994 parks bond. A replacement bond measure would replace the expiring one &ndash; without increasing property tax rates. If the 1994 bond expires in 2015 and is not replaced, the annual property tax rate paid by a typical homeowner with a home valued at $150,000 would decrease by $13.(1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: (1) The property tax levy rate for the expiring bonds is approximately $0.0877 per $1,000 of assessed value. This is the estimated levy rate for November 2014. The proposed debt service of the new bonds would maintain the same levy rate of approximately $0.0877 beginning in November 2015. As the levy rate would stay approximately the same, the actual amount each taxpayer pays annually may change based upon possible changes in assessed value of individual property. Collection of property taxes to repay the potential new bonds would not happen until after the current bond expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DHM Survey Key Findings:</p>
<p>-With minimal information, Portlanders express support for a parks bond at 48% supporting (26% strong support, 22% somewhat support) and 12% not sure.</p>
<p>Support jumps to 68% (with 40% strong support) when Portlanders learn the bond is a replacement bond and will fund critical parks repairs without increasing tax rates.</p>
<p>-Even after learning that property taxes would go down if voters reject a bond, voters choose to keep tax rates level in order to make critical investments in our parks system.</p>
<p>-Opposition to the measure only grows by a few percentage points (and support drops to 65%) when Portlanders are given opposition rationale about why not to support the replacement bond.</p>
<p>-Among the top projects to support within the replacement bond: replacement of deteriorating playgrounds leads the pack, followed by repairing trails and bridges and conducting major repairs on community swimming pools in order to prevent closures.</p>
<p>Portlanders outline key reasons to support the replacement bond as being:</p>
<p>-because it would not increase the tax rate</p>
<p>-because it would focus on safety and critical repairs, andbecause it would fund removing barriers and making the parks system more accessible to all, including people with disabilities.</p>
<p>-Portlanders love their parks system, with a large majority (87%) ranking the quality of service as very good (32%) or good (55%).</p>

2014,492358,Portland Parks & Recreation Survey Shows Support for Parks Replacement Bond,2,,2014-06-03 21:58:54 UTC,2014-06-02 22:16:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Respondents Strongly in Favor of Funding Critical Parks Repairs without Increasing Tax Rates</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to assess support for a possible parks replacement bond, Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commissioned DHM Research to conduct a representative telephone survey of Portlanders. The survey shows that, once Portlanders find out that a replacement bond would not increase tax rates and would fund some of the most critical repairs to our parks system, more than 65% are supportive.</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz will now open this dialogue to the larger community and parks stakeholders. Meetings and additional survey exercises, including a Town Hall (TBA), will take place during the month of June culminating in an expanded Parks Budget Advisory Committee and Portland Parks Foundation Board meeting in early July.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am cautiously optimistic that the survey indicates Portlanders may be willing to invest in crucial repairs to our Parks facilities,&rdquo; said Commissioner Fritz. &ldquo;I find it heartening that Portlanders recognize the need for investment. Still, we need to do more work to finalize our recommendation on whether to proceed with a bond replacement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""We have a nationally recognized parks system because of a 150 year legacy of public stewardship,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. ""I am pleased that the commissioner is having serious discussions on the critical maintenance needs across our parks system, including replacing aging playgrounds, fixing unsafe trails, and other major repairs which currently lack funding.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey was conducted from May 21-23, 2014, and interviewed 800 likely voters. Some questions were split sampled to compare alternative versions. The survey&rsquo;s margin of error ranges from &plusmn;3.5% (N=800) to &plusmn;4.9% (N=400). DHM Research has produced the following key findings and attached detailed results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Portlanders have preserved and built our incredible parks system through a series of capital investments (bonds, levies) over the last century. Portlanders last passed a parks bond in 1994. Portlanders will soon fully repay that bond and it expires next year. Also, over the next ten years, Portland's parks will need more than $365 million in replacement and maintenance projects. This provides a unique opportunity &ndash; if Portlanders continue to make the same rate of payments on property taxes over the next 20 years, it can generate an estimated $56-$68 million in bond revenue to pay for critical repairs to our parks system. Commissioner Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation are looking into whether we should replace the bond without increasing tax rates. Conducting this representative telephone survey is the first step in this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Replacing the expiring bond would generate an estimated $56-$68 million to fund critical repairs, such as:</p>
<p>-The replacement of deteriorating playgrounds, including the Couch Park structure serving the Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC) Portland Public school, which recently had to be removed due to potentially catastrophic failure</p>
<p>-Reopening and stabilizing trails such as the closed Maple Trail in Forest Park</p>
<p>-Repairing community swimming pools to prevent emergency closures and extend usable life</p>
<p>-Ensuring that more facilities and natural areas are safe and accessible to all, including people with disabilities</p>
<p>-Making repairs and protecting worker safety at Mount Tabor YardMaking much-needed structural repairs to Pioneer Courthouse Square</p>
<p>-Making other major maintenance repairs like restoring restrooms, fixing leaking roofs, and more</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homeowners currently pay $.0877/$1000 on their assessed property value (AV) for the expiring 1994 parks bond. A replacement bond measure would replace the expiring one &ndash; without increasing property tax rates. If the 1994 bond expires in 2015 and is not replaced, the annual property tax rate paid by a typical homeowner with a home valued at $150,000 would decrease by $13.(1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: (1) The property tax levy rate for the expiring bonds is approximately $0.0877 per $1,000 of assessed value. This is the estimated levy rate for November 2014. The proposed debt service of the new bonds would maintain the same levy rate of approximately $0.0877 beginning in November 2015. As the levy rate would stay approximately the same, the actual amount each taxpayer pays annually may change based upon possible changes in assessed value of individual property. Collection of property taxes to repay the potential new bonds would not happen until after the current bond expires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DHM Survey Key Findings:</p>
<p>With minimal information, Portlanders express support for a parks bond at 48% supporting (26% strong support, 22% somewhat support) and 12% not sure.</p>
<p>Support jumps to 68% (with 40% strong support) when Portlanders learn the bond is a replacement bond and will fund critical parks repairs without increasing tax rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even after learning that property taxes would go down if voters reject a bond, voters choose to keep tax rates level in order to make critical investments in our parks system. Opposition to the measure only grows by a few percentage points (and support drops to 65%) when Portlanders are given opposition rationale about why not to support the replacement bond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the top projects to support within the replacement bond: replacement of deteriorating playgrounds leads the pack, followed by repairing trails and bridges and conducting major repairs on community swimming pools in order to prevent closures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portlanders outline key reasons to support the replacement bond:</p>
<ul>
<li>because it would not increase the tax rate</li>
<li>because it would focus on safety and critical repairs, and</li>
<li>because it would fund removing barriers and making parks system more accessible to all, including people with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Portlanders love their parks systems, with a large majority (87%) ranking the quality of service as very good (32%) or good (55%).</p>

2014,492093,Portland Parks & Recreation to Honor the late Charles Jordan this Saturday,2,,2014-05-29 20:11:33 UTC,2014-05-29 19:41:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Free Community Celebration to Remember the Legacy of a Portland Legend</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will hold a free, public remembrance event for the late Charles Jordan this Saturday, beginning at 2pm. The celebration of the life of a Portland icon will include brief remarks by Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Earl Blumenauer, a proclamation from Mayor Charlie Hales, remarks from City Commissioners Amanda Fritz and Nick Fish, Portland Fire and Rescue Chief Erin Janssens, stories from Jordan&rsquo;s close friends and former colleagues - and the two were far from mutually exclusive - closing remarks from Bishop A.A. Wells of Emmanuel Temple, live music, and a reception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WHAT: A celebration of the late former Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director and City Commissioner Charles Jordan.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHEN: Saturday, May 31, 2pm-4pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE: Charles Jordan Community Center, 9009 N. Foss Ave., Portland</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charles Jordan died on April 4 after a long illness. Jordan&rsquo;s son Dion, a Portland Parks Board member, recalled a conversation with his father from a few years ago, when Charles Jordan reflected on his life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I never set out to do all this. I never set out to accompli</p>
<p>sh the things I've done&rsquo;,&rdquo; recalled Dion. &ldquo;He said he only wanted to do one thing, and that was the right thing. That he wanted to treat everybody right, love everyone unconditionally, and then he felt like his life would be meaningful. And it has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan helped bring more than 40 new properties into the now nationally-recognized and widely admired PP&amp;R system, including Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, Delta Park, East Portland Community Center (the most utilized in our system) and Southwest Community Center. He was instrumental in obtaining the funding for several large, key renovation projects through the major and much-needed 1994 Parks bond. And he secured the funding to revitalize the center that now bears his name, Charles Jordan Community Center - which serves an area of town that benefits greatly from the center&rsquo;s huge variety of low-cost, high quality health and recreation offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles transformed us from a bureau into a family,&rdquo; current PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute; said at the proclamation ceremony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen and heard the word &lsquo;inspiring&rsquo; associated with Charles perhaps more than any other. It is more than appropriate. One of the amazing things about Charles was his ability to bring people along with him. He had deep compassion for others, especially those who had been marginalized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Jordan is established in history as one of the heroes of Portland,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;At the recent 30th birthday celebration for Pioneer Courthouse Square, I asked for both a moment of silence and a round of applause for Charles. Both were deafening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won't soon forget what we've learned from your father, Dion,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Nick Fish, a former Parks commissioner. &ldquo;The best way to remember your father is to remember what he taught us. And we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other elements of the Charles Jordan remembrance event include a Native blessing from the Bow and Arrow Culture Club, a video presentation, remarks from former City Commissioner Mike Lindberg, Evan Smith, vice-president of a local conservation fund, Michelle Harper and David Judd, both formerly, of PP&amp;R, and David Leslie, Executive Director of Ecumenical Ministries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notable Charles Jordan quotes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t understand, they won&rsquo;t value; what they don&rsquo;t value, they won&rsquo;t protect; and what they don&rsquo;t protect, they will lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today you follow, but tomorrow you will be expected to lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If change is to be, it&rsquo;s up to you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams are simply goals with wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone steal your joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take good care of yourself and you can care for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than just fun and games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Develop a passion for something and do it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Model the way &ndash; you never know who is watching and wanting to be just like you.&rdquo;</p>

2014,488286,Portland Parks & Recreation to Close a Popular Playground Attraction at Couch Park,2,,2014-04-23 00:41:11 UTC,2014-04-22 21:43:00 UTC,A,,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to safety concerns and after years of close monitoring, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is closing the popular wooden play structure and wooden stage at the Couch Park playground (NW 19th Ave &amp; Glisan, adjacent to Portland Public Schools&rsquo; Metropolitan Learning Center school) effective immediately. The closure comes after PP&amp;R staff and an engineering firm&rsquo;s determination that the structural stability of the wood playground structure (approximately 40 years old) and stage are at risk. Other, newer play equipment at Couch Park is not affected and will remain open. Though PP&amp;R has stated we want to replace the play structure, no time frame nor funding are available at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We simply will not take any chances when it comes to the safety of the children who play at our playgrounds,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Our staff has been evaluating the wooden structure at Couch Park for years. We&rsquo;ve had to remove several pieces of play equipment in that time frame, bit by bit; it&rsquo;s the reality of decades-old, wooden playground attractions in a rainy climate. We know the wooden play structure has been a beloved, popular attraction for children and families. I know people will be disappointed, but I hope they&rsquo;ll all agree that safety is, and should be, our bureau&rsquo;s top priority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation crews have been monitoring the structure carefully over several years. PP&amp;R recently asked an independent engineering firm, G2 Consultants, for an analysis of the play structure to help us understand any risks, and to determine appropriate next steps. Based on the engineers&rsquo; findings and our own staff&rsquo;s assessment, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation must fence nearly 40 year-old the wooden structure to take it out of use immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that we need to close a showpiece element in a playground where hundreds of children play illustrates the grave need for more money to maintain our system,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is grossly underfunded. Despite the long-acknowledged challenges to our system, we have made PP&amp;R a nationally-recognized parks bureau thanks to amazing staff, valuable public-private partnerships, friends and partner groups. But such efforts can only go so far. This playground structure closure shows that we&rsquo;ve reached our limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wooden play structure at Couch Park is now cordoned off. PP&amp;R will be installing construction fencing around the structure this afternoon. A wooden stage near the playground will also be fenced off due to safety concerns. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation owns and manages the playground itself; the land on which the playground sits is PPS property, specifically the adjacent Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has long been testing the wooden play structure at Couch; with an eye on the deteriorating wooden beams that make up the structure. The report from G2 Consultants, Inc. lists several concerns, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Poor overall structural condition; some structural elements are coming apart, others contain dry rot</li>
<li>Severe rotting of wood in parts of the structure&rsquo;s flooring</li>
<li>Presence of termites</li>
<li>Wood and steel railings severely deteriorated due to weather</li>
</ul>
<p>PP&amp;R crews have been monitoring the structure carefully over several years. On several occasions staff have needed to remove pieces and portions of the wood structure &ndash; as well as other play equipment in the Couch Park playground - as they fell into disrepair. Most recently crews removed the monkey bars and several other features in October, 2012. Our crews have done our best to repair and maintain the structure, but it is no longer possible to consider it a safe place to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is disappointing news, especially for the young students of MLC,&rdquo; says Trent Thelen, a Couch Park advocate and parent of an MLC student. &ldquo;The play area is valuable for all visitors &ndash; kids and parents alike - to engage in free, unfettered play. However, we look forward to working with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and hopefully, neighborhood partners, on efforts to revitalize the playground. We look with optimism towards a revitalized Couch Park as an improved open space for the next generation of park users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The closest playgrounds to Couch Park are Wallace Park, NW 25th and Raleigh, and The Fields Park, NW 10th &amp; Overton. Though PP&amp;R has stated we want to replace the play structure, no time frame nor funding are available at this point. Building a new playground will require community involvement and input. In the immediate future, it could require a fundraising campaign since funds for a new structure are not available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major repairs and equipment replacement must come out of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s General Fund, allocated by the City, rather than System Development Charges (SDCs). SDCs are revenue from construction development. SDC revenue is restricted to expanding capacity only; SDCs cannot be used for other purposes such as the Couch Park playground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on PP&amp;R&rsquo;s current Capital Improvement Plan (CIP), the annual funding gap for repairing/renovation of existing assets is $36.5M. This means that we have $36.5M of unfunded maintenance projects planned each year for the next ten years; a ten-year total of$365M of unfunded maintenance projects. The Couch Park play structure has been and remains on PP&amp;R&rsquo;s capital improvements list because we want neighbors to have a safe, accessible and enjoyable play structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if funding becomes available to potentially replace the playground, please note that no project will go forward without community input.&nbsp;</p>

2014,486940,"Mayor, City Commissioners Honor the Late Charles Jordan with Formal Proclamation, Day of Remembrance",2,,2014-04-09 18:14:35 UTC,2014-04-09 18:12:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Mayor Charlie Hales issued a mayoral proclamation this morning honoring the late, beloved Charles Jordan. Hales proclaimed today, April 9, 2014, as a day of remembrance for the former Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) director and City Commissioner, who died last Friday at the age of 77.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friends and former colleagues - and the two were far from mutually exclusive - offered thoughts prior to this morning&rsquo;s formal City Council session on Jordan&rsquo;s impressive and lasting legacy, and how he will be remembered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loved every color in the rainbow of humanity,&rdquo; said retired PP&amp;R Director Zari Santner, who succeeded Jordan as head of the bureau. &ldquo;Because he knew that diversity would increase vitality for all. His most enduring gift was to inspire&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s son Dion, a Portland Parks board member, was on hand to accept the Mayor&rsquo;s proclamation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for all the love, condolences and support you all have shared with me and my family,&rdquo; said an emotional Dion Jordan as he addressed the Mayor and City Commissioners. &ldquo;My father&hellip;was something special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recalling a conversation with his father from a few years ago, Dion remembered Charles Jordan reflecting on his life&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I never set out to do all this. I never set out to accomplish the things I've done&rsquo;,&rdquo; recalled Dion. &ldquo;He said he only wanted to do one thing, and that was the right thing. That he wanted to treat everybody right, love everyone unconditionally, and then he felt like his life would be meaningful. And it has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan helped bring more than 40 new properties into the now nationally-recognized and widely admired PP&amp;R system, including Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade, Delta Park, East Portland Community Center (the most utilized in our system) and Southwest Community Center. He was instrumental in obtaining the funding for several large, key renovation projects through the major and much-needed 1994 Parks bond. And he secured the funding to revitalize the center that now bears his name, Charles Jordan Community Center - which serves an area of town that benefits greatly from the center&rsquo;s huge variety of low-cost, high quality health and recreation offerings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles transformed us from a bureau into a family,&rdquo; current PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute; said at the proclamation ceremony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen and heard the word &lsquo;inspiring&rsquo; associated with Charles perhaps more than any other. It is more than appropriate. One of the amazing things about Charles was his ability to bring people along with him. He had deep compassion for others, especially those who had been marginalized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Jordan is established in history as one of the heroes of Portland,&rdquo; said Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;At last Sunday&rsquo;s 30th birthday celebration for Pioneer Courthouse Square, I asked for both a moment of silence and a round of applause for Charles. Both were deafening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won't soon forget what we've learned from your father, Dion,&rdquo; said City Commissioner Nick Fish, a former Parks commissioner. &ldquo;The best way to remember your father is to remember what he taught us. And we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have our ways to remember Charles,&rdquo; said Mayor Hales. &ldquo;For me personally, I think on a nice spring day like this, I'm going to go walk around a park or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s memorial service will be private, for family only. The Mayor ordered all City flags to fly at half-mast from April 4 (the day of Jordan&rsquo;s death) through Saturday, April 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Charles Jordan</p>
<p>Charles Jordan&rsquo;s leadership, commitment to Portland, and innovative policies are anchors of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s mission and philosophy now and going forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan was a former Portland City Commissioner, and former Director of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation whose leadership over more than three decades will be felt indefinitely. In June, 2012, the Portland City Council voted unanimously to rename Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s University Park Community Center in honor of Charles Jordan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never has, and there never will be, someone more deserving of this honor,&rdquo; said Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish at the time. &ldquo;He was the person who took Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to the next level. Charles Jordan is a champion for the environment and conservation nationwide. His commitment to children, families, and to building community is extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renamed Charles Jordan Community Center &ndash; a building made possible by his efforts &ndash; was dedicated on Sunday, July 22, 2012 with a free public celebration.</p>
<p>After spending his early life in rural Texas, Jordan served as an officer in the U.S. Army. He received his B.S. fromGonzagaUniversityin Education, Sociology, and Philosophy. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Law degree by theUniversityofVermont.</p>
<p>Jordanspent 10 years as Portland&rsquo;s first African-American City Commissioner beginning in 1974. He served 14 years as Director of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and retired in 2003. Jordan literally changed Portland&rsquo;s landscape by overseeing 44 new parks and natural areas during his tenure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan was the force behind Portland landmarks such as Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center,Delta Park,Southwest Community &nbsp;Center, renovations to Tom McCall Waterfront Park and Matt Dishman Community Center, and many more public projects and successes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As City Commissioner, Charles Jordan was noted for his innovative and unconventional approaches to problem solving. He developed the Community Juvenile Officer Program that put Portland Police officers in local schools to engage youth through positive interaction and activities. As Fire Commissioner, he developed an outreach training program to recruit people of color to the Fire Bureau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the national stage, Charles Jordan broadened the agenda of the environmental movement and land conservation to make it more inclusive. He is known for his groundbreaking approach to putting people &ndash; particularly people of color &ndash; at the heart of the American Conservation Movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His great saying was &lsquo;Parks are more than just fun and games,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Michelle Harper, who worked with Jordan for years in several capacities. &ldquo;He is a spiritual person with a strong connection to his church, and he saw us all as being connected.Portland&rsquo;s parks were where we could come together to build community and family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notable Charles Jordan quotes</p>
<p>&ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t understand, they won&rsquo;t value; what they don&rsquo;t value, they won&rsquo;t protect; and what they don&rsquo;t protect, they will lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today you follow, but tomorrow you will be expected to lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If change is to be, it&rsquo;s up to you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreams are simply goals with wings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let anyone steal your joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take good care of yourself and you can care for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re more than just fun and games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Develop a passion for something and do it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Model the way &ndash; you never know who is watching and wanting to be just like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Celebration on April 10 with City Leaders, Portland Timbers&rsquo; Steven Evans</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament is proud to invite prospective players, coaches, and sponsors to David Douglas High School this Thursday for a special Soccer Day. Soccer Day is the kick-off/sign-up event for this year&rsquo;s Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament. Portland Timbers midfielder Steven Evans will be a special guest. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Creative Youth Soccer Leaders encourage teens to come out to meet Evans, and to learn more about the upcoming 5th annual tournament, to be held July 3 &amp; 4, 2014, at Delta Park. Teams, coaches, and volunteers may register at this Thursday&rsquo;s event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT: Soccer Day: The 5th Annual Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament info and registration celebration</p>
<p>WHEN: Thursday, April 10, 4pm-5:30pm</p>
<p>WHERE: David Douglas High School cafeteria, 1001 SE 135th Ave.</p>
<p>WHO: Join Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Portland Fire &amp; Rescue Chief Erin Janssens, Portland Police Assistant Chief Michael Crebs, Portland Timbers midfielder Steven Evans, coaches, PP&amp;R staff, and tournament volunteers. Hosted by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Creative Youth Soccer Leaders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament engages underserved and underrepresented immigrant and refugee youth who&rsquo;ve come to Portland from all over the world, representing nearly two dozen ethnicities and cultures. This event is an important celebration of diversity, family, partnership, and integration in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we talk about &lsquo;closing the play gap&rsquo; here in Portland, we mean providing for people who need parks, recreation and play the most,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament and its related activities help foster awareness about what our city offers for people new to Portland &ndash; athletic, educational, career opportunities and more - through the international language of football - also known as soccer here in Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz will be joined by Portland Timbers midfielder Steven Evans at the kick-off celebration. The kick-off is just one part of the Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament, which is part of a year-round educational and life skills program put on by City of Portland staff, partners, and volunteers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament is about much more than a game,&rdquo; says Polo Catalani of the Office of Equity and Human Rights. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about investing our efforts now to embrace the changing face of our city, about integrating people new to both Portland and the United States into our society and our quality of life, and about showing them how to take part in democracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catalani notes that one in five Portlanders are now foreign-born, and nearly half of area public school students belong to ethnic minority families. In many underserved north and east Portland neighborhoods, these percentages are even higher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Fire &amp; Rescue (PFR) Chief Erin Janssens will be on hand at Thursday&rsquo;s kick-off event. PFR sponsors and coaches teams in the Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament, and will host teens at a firefighter training session. The Portland Police Bureau also sponsors and coaches teams, and PPB Assistant Chief Michael&nbsp; Crebs will share info on police programs and motivating stories with guests at the celebration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the Portland World Cup of Soccer</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation first developed the Portland World Cup in 2010. The tournament brings to the pitch a celebration of cultural traditions and diversity - an enrichment event that links the culturally diverse communities, the Portland community, and the City of Portland. This event is a gathering for Portland&rsquo;s youth to kick for a common purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than two dozen local community organizations join together with the City of Portland to host the annual tournament at Delta Park. The 2013 tournament included 14 teams and more than 200 athletes, representing more than a dozen countries. The players&rsquo; ages range from 16-19 years old.</p>
<p>But the Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament is about much more than soccer. Ongoing community efforts for players help athletes secure summer jobs and career training. This mission fits well with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the primary force behind the tournament as well as the largest employer of teens in the City of Portland. Players new to the Rose City also learn about the wide variety of services offered by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and other city entities, and how to take part in them. Players tour city offices including the fire bureau training academy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We help youth get past the challenges of being a teen, and a newcomer to Portland. We foster peace, understanding, and embracing other cultures.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing could be more American.</p>

<p>-Charles Jordan, on Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;POSTED APRIL 4, 2014</p>
<p>Beloved former Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Director and City Commissioner Charles Jordan passed away in his home this morning after a long illness.</p>
<p>Charles Jordan was a pioneer for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and implemented lasting and landmark programs for all Portlanders. Jordan&rsquo;s legacy has and continues to enhance the lives of current and future generations. Just a few hallmarks of Jordan&rsquo;s tenure include popular PP&amp;R programs such as the free annual series of Movies in the Park, plus innumerable youth initiatives. Jordan gained public support for critical parks bond and levy measures. He oversaw 44 new Portland parks and natural areas during his tenure. Charles Jordan&rsquo;s leadership, commitment to Portland, and innovative policies are anchors of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s mission and philosophy now and going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Jordan is established in history as one of the heroes of Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;His many contributions to our community live on, and his memory will inspire others to reach beyond ordinary goals to achieve greatness. &ldquo;Charles JOrdan epitomized the best in community-building leadership in Portland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Jordan was one of my heroes,&rdquo; says City Commissioner Nick Fish, a former Parks Commissioner. &ldquo;One of the greatest moments in my public service was honoring Charles at the dedication of the Charles Jordan Community Center in the Portsmouth neighborhood. He was a national leader in the parks movement. Today is a sad day for the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation family.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Mayor Charlie Hales has ordered all City flags to fly at half-mast from today through Saturday, April 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As Portland&rsquo;s first African-American City Commissioner and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director, Charles was the champion for much of what we love about Portland's parks,&rdquo; says Mayor Hales. &ldquo;Charles Jordan was most of all about access to parks and recreation programs for everyone. He was passionate about that principle, and the rest of us caught the inspiration from him.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Jordan inspired us all,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;His energy and positive attitude were contagious; he drew people to him and motivated people to help themselves, and their community. At Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Charles transformed us from a bureau to a family. We continue that tradition even today among all &ldquo;Parkies&rdquo;. His loss leaves a hole in our hearts, but Charles&rsquo; legacy lives on.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan&rsquo;s memorial service will be private, for family only.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Charles Jordan<img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=486039"" alt=""Charles Jordan"" width=""250"" height=""187.5"" /><br /></strong>Charles Jordan is a former Portland City Commissioner, and former Director of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation whose leadership over more than three decades will be felt indefinitely.&nbsp;In June, 2012, the Portland City Council voted unanimously to rename Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s University Park Community Center in honor of Charles Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There never has, and there never will be, someone more deserving of this honor,&rdquo; said Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;He was the person who took Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to the next level. Charles Jordan is a champion for the environment and conservation nationwide. His commitment to children, families, and to building community is extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The renamed Charles Jordan Community Center &ndash; a building made possible by his efforts &ndash; was dedicated on Sunday, July 22, 2012 with a free public celebration.</p>
<p>After spending his early life in rural Texas, Jordan served as an officer in the U.S. Army. He received his B.S. from Gonzaga University in Education, Sociology, and Philosophy. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Law degree by the University of Vermont.</p>
<p>Jordan spent 10 years as Portland&rsquo;s first African-American City Commissioner beginning in 1974. He served 14 years as Director of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and retired in 2003. Jordan literally changed Portland&rsquo;s landscape by overseeing 44 new parks and natural areas during his tenure.<br />Jordan was the force behind Portland landmarks such as Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, Delta Park, Southwest Community Center, renovations to Tom McCall Waterfront Park and Matt Dishman Community Center, and many more public projects and successes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As City Commissioner, Charles Jordan was noted for his innovative and unconventional approaches to problem solving. He developed the Community Juvenile Officer Program that put Portland Police officers in local schools to engage youth through positive interaction and activities. As Fire Commissioner, he developed an outreach training program to recruit people of color to the Fire Bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the national stage, Charles Jordan broadened the agenda of the environmental movement and land conservation to make it more inclusive. He is known for his groundbreaking approach to putting people &ndash; particularly people of color &ndash; at the heart of the American Conservation Movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His great saying was &lsquo;Parks are more than just fun and games,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Michelle Harper, who worked with Jordan for years in several capacities. &ldquo;He is a spiritual person with a strong connection to his church, and he saw us all as being connected. Portland&rsquo;s parks were where we could come together to build community and family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2014,484755,Portland Parks & Recreation to add 85 Acres of Open Space in Cully Neighborhood,2,,2014-03-20 17:15:24 UTC,2014-03-20 17:12:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz are pleased to announce that on March 19, 2014, Portland City Council unanimously approved the City&rsquo;s acquisition of 85 acres of natural area and the Colwood Golf Course. The land will be acquired and managed through a partnership with the Bureau of Environmental Services and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to bring a large portion of the Colwood Golf Course and natural area into public ownership,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;It is land which represents significant environmental and recreational opportunities for the entire City of Portland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The property includes the golf course, along with open parkland and forested and wetland areas that protect the Columbia Slough. The City&rsquo;s acquisition of the Colwood property is part of a long-term project that will reshape the existing property into the Cully neighborhood&rsquo;s most important public natural area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As our city grows, and fills in, there are fewer and fewer opportunities to protect nature in the city,&rdquo; said Environmental Services Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;The</p>
<p>acquisition of Colwood is a wonderful example of providing industrial land while preserving a watershed for future generations of Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will manage more than one-third of the restored land as a natural area, protecting wildlife and water quality, creating a rare opportunity for Portlanders to access nature in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a win-win property for the City of Portland,&rdquo; said Don Goldberg, Senior Project Manager for The Trust for Public Land, the national non-profit that managed this complex deal. &ldquo;We will add much-needed public open space along with natural areas in the densely-populated Cully neighborhood that generations of families will be able to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Significant restoration and enhancement of wetlands and forest will be undertaken by the owner of the industrial portion of the property. 48 acres at the north of the property was rezoned for commercial/industrial use in October 2013.</p>
<p>During the transition, as PP&amp;R finalizes plans for the land in consultation with the local community, we will continue to operate a portion of the property as a 9-hole golf facility with other amenities. Ultimately, the aim is to give local people close-to-home access to a lifetime of outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FINANCES</p>
<p>The City&rsquo;s cost to acquire the entire Colwood property is $5 million:</p>
<p>$4.5 million of the cost comes from&nbsp;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation's investment of System Development Charges (SDCs), reimbursement from golf revenue over time, and potential grants/partnerships.&nbsp; The Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) is contributing $500,000 to the acquisition cost, as clean water is part of their mission.</p>

2014,484600,"Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Portland Parks & Recreation Announce Dawson Park Improvement Milestone",2,,2014-03-19 16:58:19 UTC,2014-03-19 16:57:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Upgraded Playground Equipment and Surfacing Assured, Will Benefit Children of All Abilities</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announces that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has identified added funding to upgrade the new playground surfacing and equipment at the soon-to-be revitalized Dawson Park, at N. Stanton St &amp; Williams Ave. Fritz delivered the news first to the Northeast Coalition of Neighborhoods (NECN).&nbsp; In addition to a playground surface designed to be universally accessible, several pieces of play equipment were specifically chosen for their ability to be enjoyed by children of all abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are exciting changes to a park that is widely treasured and has a significant history,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I am thrilled that Dawson Park is being re-energized, and proud to see our City working with neighbors to make it a vibrant part of the community once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important that the playground will accommodate children and adults of all abilities,&rdquo; she adds, noting that Dawson Park is located directly across from the Randall Children&rsquo;s Hospital at Legacy Emanuel. Several other organizations that serve and mentor children are also located near the park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new type of play surfacing is a sustainable and permeable system that utilizes shredded vehicle tires (one recycled tire for each square foot of play surface). This type of surfacing allows greater accessibility for people with disabilities, as compared to the typical ""engineered wood fiber"" play surfacing found in most of Portland's playgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enhanced turf and playground equipment are part of the larger Portland Development Commission (PDC) /PP&amp;R construction effort to restore the park as a key community gathering space while honoring its rich African-American history. The $2.7 million renovation project will make the park more welcoming and attractive, with a central lawn, an improved playground, interactive water play feature, barbeques, flowering plants, bike racks, picnic tables and benches, and lighted pathways and better accessibility. Construction began in October of 2013 and is expected to be completed in June of 2014. PDC&rsquo;s Interstate Corridor Urban Renewal Area is providing $2.3 million to fund the park improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawson Park is more than just a park&mdash;it&rsquo;s a symbol of this neighborhood, North-Northeast Portland and our constant vision for a better city,&rdquo; says PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton. &ldquo;These improvements are truly community-driven and we are honored to play a role in the revitalization of this community asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The redesigned Dawson Park stands as a testament to Portland&rsquo;s commitment to a community open and available to everyone and to a better and brighter future for all its children,&rdquo; says Paul Anthony, Parks Budget Advisory Committee liaison and NECN Parks Subcommittee member.</p>
<p>The park will also benefit from a $200,000 Legacy Emanuel Medical Center donation via the non-profit Portland Parks Foundation. The funds are dedicated to a new water feature at the soon-to-be-renovated park, which encompasses just over two acres. Legacy Emanuel Medical Center&rsquo;s generous contribution provides two-thirds of the needed funding for this exciting park element.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The water feature is one of several opportunities offered in Dawson Park&rsquo;s upcoming redesign, which was shaped through extensive community input and aims to celebrate the park&rsquo;s history. The multimillion dollar makeover will encompass numerous improvements, including interpretive panels which tell the history of the neighborhood and the park, important centers of Portland&rsquo;s African-American community. The interactive water feature is seen as a vital and unique play element for the community. It was originally suggested by neighbors during extensive public involvement, and heavily supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gratifying to see these dramatic and tangible park improvements,&rdquo; says Michael Alexander, president and CEO of the Urban League of Portland and longtime Portland Parks Board member. &ldquo;It is important to deeply understand the history here, while still focusing on the future. We look forward to a tremendous new park and appreciate the commitment by the City and its partners to increase the quality of life for all here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historic Dawson Park has served as an integral social, political and economic center for many communities &ndash; most notably, Portland&rsquo;s African-American community. The neighborhood around Dawson once was the heart of Portland&rsquo;s African-American population, and the new park design will recognize that heritage with double-sided cast-stone medallions designed by artist Isaka Shamsud-Din to be placed in a decorative fence surrounding the playground. One side will be inspired by traditional African Ndebele patterns; the other side will contain historic neighborhood remembrances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is a partnership between the Portland Development Commission (PDC) and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. The Interstate Corridor Urban Renewal Area will provide $2.3 million in funding, with remaining support for the water play feature from Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Portland Parks Foundation and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Support for the public artwork comes from the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council. R&amp;R General Contractors has been selected to construct the park improvements; 87% of the construction work will be performed by MWDESB-certified contractors.</p>

<p>Construction began in October of 2013 and is expected to be completed in June of 2014. For current project information, visit <a href=""/parks/54478"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/54478</a></p>

The amount of Portland&rsquo;s land covered by trees, known as the urban canopy, has increased by nearly 3% during the past nine years. The success is due to efforts undertaken by successful public-private partnerships including the Tree Stewardship Coalition, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Friends of Trees and the Bureau of Environmental Services. Currently, 30% of Portland&rsquo;s surface area is covered in urban forest, with a goal of 33% (per the Urban Forest Management Plan, completed in 2004).</p>

<p><em>Partners Join Forces on Further Projects</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and the Halprin Landscape Conservancy (HLC) announce a major milestone in the restoration project at internationally-recognized Lovejoy Fountain. PP&amp;R and HLC have completed the structural stabilization of Lovejoy Fountain&rsquo;s architecturally dynamic shelter, through a public-private partnership. PP&amp;R and HLC are laying the groundwork to perform further restoration work on the plaza and fountain in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Designed by the renowned architect Charles Moore in collaboration with Lawrence Halprin and Associates, the shelter is an important and integral part of the plaza,&rdquo; says Halprin Conservancy president Randy Gragg. &ldquo;It calls to mind an abstract sense of a high mountain backdrop to the cascading fountain plaza. The Halprin Landscape Conservancy is delighted to help in revitalizing the structurally unique and innovative shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lovejoy Fountain is part of the Portland Open Space Sequence, an interconnected series of urban plazas designed by Halprin to evoke a metaphorical watershed. The HLC spearheaded the effort and worked with PP&amp;R to stabilize the structure and refurbish the fountain shelter&rsquo;s pillars. The HLC worked to find private funding through the CH2M Hill Foundation to help make the fountain restoration possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very thankful to the Halprin Landscape Conservancy, and to HLC board member David Knowles,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;David secured a pivotal $20,000 contribution from the CH2M Hill Foundation to make up a shortfall and extend the restoration to the beautiful, tile drinking fountain and benches. His efforts allowed this project to move forward. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation extends our sincere thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us for a celebration of the important first-phase restoration of the architecturally dynamic shelter at the internationally recognized Lovejoy Fountain, completed through the partnership of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Halprin Landscape Conservancy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT: Celebrate a major milestone of the restoration of Lovejoy Fountain&rsquo;s shelter, a Portland gem, with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Halprin Landscape Conservancy. Brief remarks from partners and a ribbon-cutting.</p>
<p>WHERE: Lovejoy Fountain, SW 3rd Ave &amp; Harrison St.</p>
<p>WHEN: Wednesday, March 12, at 3pm</p>
<p>WHO: Join friends and partners, including Portland City Commissioner Amanda Fritz (invited), PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, and Halprin Conservancy President Randy Gragg to applaud the restoration of a seminal work of design and an important public-private partnership.</p>
<p>Halprin Landscape Conservancy shares PP&amp;R&rsquo;s goal of creating and maintaining safe places for rest, reflection and play across our city. Both groups promote our natural landscape as inspiration for park design, and celebrate the parks and squares in our urban environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovejoy Fountain and Lawrence Halprin&rsquo;s other Portland works inspired a whole new way of looking at the city,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, a Fellow with the American Society of Landscape Architects. &ldquo;And our public-private partnership with the Halprin Landscape Conservancy is a model for how government and private advocates can work together for the good of our city. Many, many thanks to the HLC and to David Knowles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HLC Board recently approved a three-year business plan to complete full restoration of Lovejoy Fountain Portland and the Open Space Sequence&rsquo;s other plazas&mdash;Pettygrove Park, Keller Fountain, and the Source Fountain&mdash;by June, 2016, the 50th anniversary of the opening of Lovejoy Fountain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

2014,481492,Portland Park Rangers Recover Stolen Specialty Bicycle,2,,2016-05-17 18:41:23 UTC,2014-02-18 20:56:00 UTC,A,,"<p><em>Theft Victim Lauds Rangers for Helpfulness, Contributions to Parks</em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Park Rangers recovered a stolen, unique bicycle and returned it to its rightful owner. Seth Burke reported his bike, a Surly Pugsley, popular on snow or sand, as stolen in front of a business on SW Taylor last Monday, February 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was dismayed,&rdquo; says Burke. &ldquo;I filed a police report, contacted every resource I could; put it on Craigslist, and went around town with a photo of my bike asking people if they&rsquo;d seen it. I got reports of people trying to sell it around town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Thursday (February 13), Burke flagged down Portland Park Ranger Ray Turner on the Eastbank Esplanade. Burke provided the ranger with the stolen bike&rsquo;s description and a photo. Ranger Turner passed the information on to other Park Rangers.</p>
<p>Later that day, Ranger Turner and his partner, Karras Kalivas, spotted a man with a bike which matched the stolen cycle&rsquo;s description in Director Park - around 100 feet from where the bicycle disappeared. They notified the man with the cycle that the bike had been reported stolen. The man took off on foot, after saying he wanted &ldquo;no part of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burke, the bike&rsquo;s owner, provided an accurate description of his cycle and produced a key to a lock that was still attached to the specialty bike. While he now has his bike back, he says the Park Rangers have his thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rangers Ray Turner and Karras Kalivas were very professional, very thorough, extremely helpful, and a huge benefit to this situation and to the public safety and health of our parks and city,&rdquo; says Burke. &ldquo;A lot of us may not even know what Park Rangers do, and how beneficial they are to our parks. I can&rsquo;t thank them enough.&rdquo;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/481492

2014,480939,Portland Parks & Recreation Contributes $1.25 Million towards Thomas Cully Park Construction,2,,2014-02-12 17:29:23 UTC,2014-02-12 17:27:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Project Spearheaded by Verde</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz announces that Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will contribute $1.25 million towards the building of Thomas Cully Park. The 25-acre future park at Northeast 72nd Avenue north of Killingsworth will be built in multiple phases. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s contribution will go towards the first construction phase, and will address the lack of parks and natural areas in the Cully neighborhood.&nbsp; 405 families who currently do not have easy access to a park or natural area (defined a half-mile walk) will benefit from Thomas Cully Park. This announcement comes a week after Fritz earmarked a significant investment for two new parks in east Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cully neighborhood is unique; it is one of the most diverse neighborhood in Portland, perhaps the state,&rdquo; notes Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;And, perhaps because of this diversity, Cully is home to some of the most dedicated and motivated community advocates in the City. I am proud to work towards our shared goal of completing Thomas Cully Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>60% of residents in the future Thomas Cully Park&rsquo;s service area are people belonging to traditionally underserved communities, and 45% are considered low income (annual household income of $40,000 or less). The $1.25 million earmarked for Thomas Cully Park comes from System Development Charges (SDC) &ndash; money raised from construction development, rather than General Fund tax dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Central Northeast Portland, nearly two out of five households are not within &frac12; mile of a park or natural area. Data show that Central Northeast is second only to the area east of I-205 in terms of the greatest need for parks and natural areas in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commissioner Fritz and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s investment in Thomas Cully Park will produce multiple benefits for low-income people and people of color,&rdquo; says Alan Hip&oacute;lito, Executive Director of Verde. &ldquo;This new park in a park-deprived neighborhood shows a deep commitment to hundreds of our neighbors. People benefit through community engagement and community-based park design. New jobs will result, youth education opportunities are created, and health is improved with a safe place to recreate. Verde thanks the continued and significant support that Let Us Build Cully Park, PP&amp;R, and our other partners have raised from many contributors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>History of Thomas Cully Park</p>
<p>The Thomas Cully Park property was a sand and gravel mine, then a construction landfill, and is now in the process of becoming a park. The City of Portland purchased the 25-acre Thomas Cully Park property in 2002.&nbsp; Working with the community, in 2008 PP&amp;R created a master plan for Thomas Cully Park to guide future developments. This master plan was then adopted by City Council in February of 2013. In 2011, PP&amp;R was approached by Verde, in coordination with the &lsquo;Let Us Build Cully Park!&rsquo; coalition (a coalition of more than 17 community-based organizations) to partner with them in a new model to develop Cully Park. In June 2012, Portland City Council approved an agreement between Verde and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for developing the park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that time, Verde has successfully raised over $2.4M thus far (including in-kind donations) to implement Phase I of the Thomas Cully Master Plan. Their total estimate for beginning Phase I work is $3,790,766. The community garden at the site was installed in 2012, and remaining improvements planned by Let Us Build Cully Park! include pathways, dog off-leash area, playgrounds and picnic areas, tribal gathering area, youth soccer field, basketball court, parking lot, restroom, north slope restoration, and improvements to NE 72nd. Implementation of Phase II of the master plan would include construction of multiple sports fields, improvements to access from NE Killingsworth, and building a parking area off of NE Killingsworth &amp; 75th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students from nearby Scott School helped design the adjacent NE 72nd Ave. Community Garden, which opened in 2012, and have had input on the park&rsquo;s</p>
<p>playground design.&nbsp; A newly proposed feature, the Inter-Tribal Gathering Garden, offers unique opportunities for honoring and educating about indigenous cultural values and ethics through holistic, culturally-significant garden design and maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenges Remain</p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist and to expanding other parks, many existing parks are at a crossroads. For decades, operating funding has been cut or remained flat forcing PP&amp;R to postpone rehabilitation and maintenance in every neighborhood throughout the city. PP&amp;R has maintenance needs totaling over $400 million. From aging playground replacements to leaking roofs, the list of needs is huge, and grows every year that we don&rsquo;t address it. The beautiful parks we love to visit are being held together by thousands of volunteers and wonderful employees going above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funding being used to create new parks is restricted to expanding capacity only. It cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is insufficient to address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of $450 million.&nbsp; Commissioner Fritz adds more context to this endeavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investing in new parks now is the right thing to do,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;For more than a hundred years, Portlanders built our parks system through a series of legacy investments. Now, we don&rsquo;t have funding for the needs in growing neighborhoods, nor for maintenance of existing facilities. It&rsquo;s time for Portland to begin to think about what our legacy will be. Will it be a legacy of increased equity and increased commitment to our region&rsquo;s uniquely beautiful parks and natural areas? I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

2014,480574,Portland City Council Approves Funding for South Waterfront Greenway – Central District,2,,2014-02-06 17:30:07 UTC,2014-02-06 17:28:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;<em>Construction to Proceed with Pathways, Overlooks, Lighting, Greenspaces</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, February 05, 2014, Portland City Council unanimously passed a measure to fund Phase 2 of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s South Waterfront Greenway &ndash; Central District project. The vote steers $4.7 million in System Development Charges (SDC&rsquo;s) &ndash; revenue from construction development in the city &ndash; to the South Waterfront Greenway Central District for construction of a park, which will contain river overlooks, bike and pedestrian pathways, lighting and seating, trees, lawns and plantings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The South Waterfront Greenway is a significant investment for the City of Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Not only is it a way to connect to nature in the heart of our city, it is a vital link for commuters, an improvement for our quality of life, and a promise kept to the people of Portland living in what will be the state&rsquo;s most densely populated neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The South Waterfront Greenway is a 1.2-mile long strip of parks and riverbank restoration that, when completed, will make an important bike and pedestrian connection between Downtown Portland and the Sellwood Bridge. Design and permitting work began 12 years ago, and construction of the Central District segment, which runs between SW Gibbs and SW Lane streets, has been underway since 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no easy feat to fit fish habitat creation, riverbank reconstruction, and an urban park into a 100-foot-wide strip of land,&rdquo; notes PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;But this project accomplishes this and more. This commitment by City Council is welcomed by PP&amp;R and neighbors. The South Waterfront Greenway will become another landmark recreation facility for all Portlanders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Financials</strong></p>
<p>The total cost of the Greenway&rsquo;s Phase 2 is estimated at $4.7 million. The contractor, JW Fowler Company, expects to begin preliminary tasks immediately, with heavy construction getting underway in early April. Work is expected to be complete by November 2014.</p>
<p>Phase 1 of the project, in partnership with TriMet, restored the riverbank to a more natural vegetation condition and installed a shallow water refuge important for juvenile salmon. TriMet joined the project because the shallow water habitat mitigates for construction impacts to the river associated with their new Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Bridge.&nbsp; Because the entire site is composed of landfill from former industrial activities, the Phase 1 earthwork and construction was conducted under the close observation of and collaboration with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, Oregon Division of State Lands, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the National Marine Fisheries Services. The total cost of Phase 1 is estimated at $10,798,100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is funded by a variety of sources: $9.26 million of Parks Systems Development Charges, $4 million of Tax Increment Funding from the North Macadam Urban Renewal Area, $1.42 million from TriMet, $750,000 in Environmental Remediation funding from the City&rsquo;s Bureau of Environmental Services; and $68,000 in miscellaneous PPR funding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Project Background</strong><br />The South Waterfront Greenway Development Plan, accepted by City Council in 2004, provided a vision and concept plan for the entire South Waterfront Greenway. The Greenway, which stretches from the Marquam Bridge south to the River Forum Building, will strive to balance the needs of the public and the health of the Willamette River.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City of Portland's South Waterfront Plan envisioned a system of parks working together to enliven the neighborhood, stimulate development activity in the area, and to provide for the recreational needs of area residents. These projects are important because they set the tone for the quality of open space in the district. For many years now, PP&amp;R has been looking at how to implement the design that the City and the community developed for the Central District portion of the Greenway.</p>
<p>Environmental Requirements: At the direction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Oregon Division of State Lands (DSL) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the design for the riverbank restoration includes habitat in the form of a shallow water bench that will provide shelter for juvenile fish and adjacent riparian plantings. Working jointly with the Corps of Engineers, Oregon DSL, NMFS, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, and the City&rsquo;s Bureau of Environmental Services, a hybrid concept was developed in summer 2010 that met public and agency needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Permitting</strong>: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued their Joint Permit for the construction in June 2012, after 20 months of review. This permit incorporated the approvals of all of the other State and Federal agencies. Local permits were also received in June 2012, allowing the project move into construction after nearly 10 years of planning and design.</p>

2014,480448,Portland Parks & Recreation Urban Forestry Announces New List of Street Trees Approved for Planting,2,,2014-02-05 20:27:01 UTC,2014-02-05 20:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Now More than 150 Tree Species to Choose From</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Urban Forestry is excited to announce a newly updated list of approved street trees for planting in the City of Portland. The selection of trees has been greatly expanded, with more than 150 tree species approved for planting in City rights-of-way. The impressive diversity of trees offers something for everyone, from brilliant fall color to showy flowers, and native species such as evergreens. The species of approved trees was determined through a collaborative process with input from PP&amp;R and Bureau of Environmental Services staff, the Urban Forestry Commission, the advocacy group Friends of Trees, local tree experts, and interested citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Property Owners</p>
<p>The City of Portland&rsquo;s approved street tree planting list guide property owners in selecting trees that are appropriate for individual sites and which contribute to the quality of the city&rsquo;s overall tree canopy. Species are approved for planting based on several criteria, including: the space available for planting, status on the nuisance plant list, threats of pests and disease, how the species has fared in the urban environment in the past, current canopy diversity, climate considerations, and desirable tree characteristics. Different trees will be approved for planting depending on the surrounding environment, with considerations such as ground space and overhead power lines taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Species Diversity</p>
<p>The new approved street tree planting list does not include maple trees, due to Portland&rsquo;s overabundance of maples. This is a big step towards increasing the resilience and health of Portland&rsquo;s tree canopy now and in the future. Maple trees make up almost 28% of Portland&rsquo;s street tree population, according to inventory data. This creates a real risk that pests affecting maples will catastrophically reduce the City&rsquo;s street tree canopy. The new approved street tree list address this risk by introducing more diverse planting options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before You Plant</p>
<p>Before planting a tree on a City street (right-of-way), you need to obtain a planting permit. The permit is free and includes an on-site inspection. Before purchasing your tree, call Urban Forestry at 503-823-4489 to request your planting permit and schedule a free on-site inspection. An Urban Forestry Tree Inspector will make sure the tree you choose is the right tree for the location and will answer any questions you may have. This will ensure that the tree provides the maximum benefit and requires minimal maintenance in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planting the Right Tree in the Right Place</p>
<p>The best street tree is one that fits well in the available space. To help property owners choose the right tree, the City maintains lists of approved street trees based on the width of the planting strip and the presence/absence of overhead high voltage power lines. Generally only primary lines (the power lines usually located above transformers) affect tree selection because trees must not come into contact with these high voltage carriers.</p>
<p>View the Street Tree Planting and Establishment Guidelines for tips on how to purchase, plant, and maintain a tree. When purchasing street trees, the required standard size is 2"" caliper for residential lots and 3.5"" caliper for commercial and industrial lots. If you are planting a conifer, it must be at least 6' tall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions?</p>
<p>The planting list website has a Frequently Asked Questions page to help answer your questions about planting in the City right-of-way. For more information on street trees, the approved street tree planting lists, and urban forest management in Portland, visit the Urban Forestry website or call Urban Forestry at 503-823-4489.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/480448

<p><em>Beech Park, Gateway Park &amp; Plaza to Enhance Underserved Area, Families; Even More Parks Coming Soon; Challenges Remain</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), and Portland Development Commission (PDC) announce plans for building two new parks in east Portland, a traditionally underserved area of the city. PP&amp;R will begin final design this year on both Beech Park (approximately 16 acres off NE 126th Ave &amp; Beech St.) and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza (four acres off NE Halsey St between NE 104th &amp; 106th Aves) with construction on both parks scheduled to begin in early 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz delivered the news to&nbsp;other city and community leaders&nbsp;on Thursday, January 30, at the future site of Gateway Park &amp; Plaza. The celebration continued at&nbsp;Shaver Elementary School (Parkrose school district), where Fritz&nbsp;told jubilant&nbsp;students that their school will soon be next to a sparkling new park. Portland Park Rangers&nbsp;were on hand to &ldquo;deputize&rdquo; kids as Youth Rangers and to distribute stickers. (Video here! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zExIaKfkqk"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zExIaKfkqk</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rdquo;In east Portland, two out of every five households do not have easy access to a City park. That is in stark contrast to the rest of Portland where four out of every five households live within a half-mile of a park or natural area,&ldquo; says Fritz, who designated Beech and Gateway Park &amp; Plaza&nbsp;for development after careful consideration of community input. Commissioner Fritz considered four worthy park options that were ready to build in east Portland &ndash; those with completed master plans.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a significant step in addressing historic inequities in parks in east Portland,&rdquo;&nbsp;adds Fritz. ""All over Portland, people are telling me, 'provide parks for people who don&rsquo;t have one'. There are inequities in every neighborhood, and insufficient resources to correct them all. These two projects begin to correct the disparities in east Portland.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of these much-needed new parks will open access to vital public green spaces for families who need and deserve them,&rdquo; says Portland Mayor Charlie Hales, who along with Commissioners Fritz, Fish, and Novick attended the announcement&nbsp;ceremony. &ldquo;I laud Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s leadership on these important projects, and I want to single out in particular the Portland Development Commission&rsquo;s $1 million contribution towards Gateway Park and Plaza. PDC&rsquo;s partnership will help revitalize the commercial appeal and livability of the Gateway neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast Facts on Beech Park:</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>- Adjacent to Shaver Elementary School in the Parkrose School District, in the Argay neighborhood of NE Portland. It will feature grand views, a sports field and basketball court, accessible play and picnic areas, shelters, pedestrian and bike paths, parking, community gardens, and a fenced off-leash dog area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equity/Equal Access</p>
<p>-The park will serve nearly 965 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 49% of these households are ethnic minorities, and 23% are below the poverty level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>- Project cost is estimated at $7.7 million ($4.2 million, phase 1; $3.5 million, phase 2), from Parks System Development Charges (not General Fund tax dollars). You can learn more about this park plan here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast Facts on Gateway Park &amp; Plaza:</p>
<p>A partnership project with Portland Development Commission</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>-The four-acre park will become a &ldquo;living room&rdquo; for the Gateway neighborhood, featuring accessible spaces and activities for all ages, including a plaza ready to accommodate a variety of events, festivals, and farmers' markets. As envisioned in the Master Plan, the park will also include flexible green spaces to accommodate picnic areas, accessible playground features and nature play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equity/Equal Access</p>
<p>The park will serve more than 800 new households which currently do not have ready access to a park. Data show that 36% of these households are ethnic minorities, and 28% are below the poverty level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>Project cost is estimated at $4.7 million, from System Development Charges (not General Fund tax dollars). The Portland Development Commission (PDC) will be contributing $1 million for the improvements, and is recruiting private investment to develop a building on NE Halsey adjacent to the new park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;news on new parks in east Portland is the first in a series of events in which Commissioner Fritz (and her fellow Commissioners), Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and its Board, Portland Parks Foundation, neighborhood leaders and members of the Portland community share in the announcements of upcoming improvements throughout our parks system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fritz will be continuing to work with neighborhood parks committees in each one of Portland&rsquo;s neighborhood coalitions and districts to get input on priorities.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is able to invest in these new parks now because of dedicated funding from fees connected with new developments, known as System Development Charges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Challenges Remain</p>
<p>As Portland Parks &amp; Recreation commits to new parks in communities where none currently exist and to expanding other parks, many existing parks are at a crossroads.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funding being used to create the two new parks in east Portland is restricted to expanding capacity only. It cannot be used to maintain or repair existing facilities. It is insufficient to address the hundreds of park projects needed by our rapidly growing neighborhoods &ndash; an additional need of $480 million.</p>
<p>Commissioner Fritz will close the event by saying &ldquo;Investing in new parks now is the right thing to do. For more than a hundred years, Portlanders built our parks system through a series of legacy investments. Now, we don&rsquo;t have funding for the needs in growing neighborhoods, nor for maintenance of existing facilities. It&rsquo;s time for Portland to begin to think about what our legacy will be. Will it be a legacy of increased equity and increased commitment to our region&rsquo;s uniquely beautiful parks and natural areas? I hope so.&rdquo;</p>

2014,477434,Portland Parks & Recreation and ODOT Announce Opening of Columbia Slough Trail,2,,2014-01-10 20:34:07 UTC,2014-01-10 20:32:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>New Biking and Walking Path Now Open</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) announce a major new biking and walking path along the Columbia Slough in north Portland. The Columbia Slough Trail, between N. Denver and Vancouver avenues, is now open for use. The paved path, more than a mile in length, is a major part of the 40 mile loop trail. It offers bicyclists and pedestrians an off-street alternative while providing amazing views of surrounding scenery, birds and wildlife from the shore of the slough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Columbia Slough Trail project cost an estimated $610,000. PP&amp;R staff completed the project design and construction management. ODOT contributed $460,000 via ODOT Community Enhancement funding. PP&amp;R provided the balance. The project is the final of ODOT&rsquo;s seven I-5 Delta Park Community Enhancements. These projects were funded with the Community Enhancement funds, based on the recommendations of the Community Enhancement Advisory Board convened by ODOT. Seven projects were selected to receive funding, most of them City of Portland projects focused on bicycle, pedestrian and livability improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear this valuable project is complete and can begin further enhancing Portlanders&rsquo; quality of life,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I appreciate the extensive work of both our PP&amp;R staff and ODOT to provide these improvements with enhanced bike and transportation options for everyone to enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among the benefits of the trail are safe passage for bikes and pedestrians under I-5, mountain views and access through habitat for birds and other wildlife. Bicyclists, runners and walkers can access the trail at entry points at Vancouver and Denver Aves. PP&amp;R also created a connection from the trail to N. Schmeer at Whitaker Road for additional access. Future improvements include a trail extension to Delta Park.</p>
<p><br />&ldquo;ODOT was pleased to provide funding to make this project possible,&rdquo; said Jason Tell, ODOT Region 1 Manager. &ldquo;ODOT is now designing another project that will connect the Columbia Slough Trail across Denver Avenue to complete this section of the 40-mile Loop. This new connection will serve recreational riders and commuters traveling to jobs in the industrial area. We continue to enjoy a great partnership with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em><strong>Program Funds Park-wide Changes to Improve Washington Park</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As park-wide improvements continue in Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Washington Park, the new and universal Pay to Park system throughout the park will go into effect on Friday, January 10, 2014.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to use the new Pay to Park system. Learn more in this video to see how: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRAg2KgCN0M"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRAg2KgCN0M</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, non-members of the Oregon Zoo, Portland Children Museum, and World Forestry Center pay $4 per vehicle at the gates of those attractions. This cost is consistent with the new universal Pay to Park system. The new system will be utilized in Washington Park&rsquo;s 1400 parking spaces during certain hours only, and many trail heads will remain free at all times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pay to Park system will allow PP&amp;R and our partner organizations to establish the stable funding necessary to make significant improvements in and around the park, to manage parking more effectively and to better address visitors&rsquo; transportation needs. 100% of all parking fees will support improvements in and around Washington Park to provide:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Funding of the WashingtonPark Transportation Management Association (TMA)</p>
<p>-Completion of theWashingtonPark Transportation Management Plan</p>
<p>-Operation of a free park-wide shuttle within Washington Park</p>
<p>-Development of a Washington Park Master Plan to guide park improvements</p>
<p>-Assessment of parking, gateway, and access needs at the north and south ends of the park</p>
<p>-Completion of initial south entrance improvements, generally consisting of a new gateway feature, way-finding signage, enhancements and landscaping, bio-filters, and an improved stormwater system</p>
<p>-Enhanced maintenance of transportation-related infrastructure in the park</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Pay to Park system is easy to use. Watch this short, entertaining video to see how:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRAg2KgCN0M"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRAg2KgCN0M</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the Pay to Park system:</p>
<p>- Currently, non-members of the Oregon Zoo, Portland Children's Museum, and World Forestry Center already pay $4 per vehicle at the gates of those attractions. This rate has been in effect for a number of years, and is consistent with the new universal (park-wide) Pay to Park system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The biggest difference between the paid parking system utilized downtown and the Pay to Park system coming at Washington Park is the pay-by-space method in the park. The Pay to Park system begins January 10, 2014.</p>
<p>-Visitors will enter their parking space number and payment at any pay station in Washington Park. They should then take their receipt with them, rather than leaving it in their vehicle.</p>
<p>-There are 30 minutes free on every transaction; though visitors must still enter your space number.</p>
<p>-Visitors can extend their stay if needed at any pay station in the park, by entering their parking space number and payment.</p>
<p>-You can choose to pay a flat daily rate or use the hourly option.</p>
<p>In December 2012, Portland City Council unanimously directed Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) to establish the new Pay to Park system to provide for safer and better service to park visitors, and to address long-standing deferred maintenance issues. Metro Council also authorized the measure. PP&amp;R has worked closely with all the attractions in the park to make the transition to this new Pay to Park system as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>As the population of the Portland metro area has grown over the past few decades, the numbers of visitors to Washington Park and its paid attractions have steadily increased, too. Today, an estimated 3 million people visit the park each year. Yet its transportation system hasn&rsquo;t kept pace and the city&rsquo;s dwindling park funds can&rsquo;t begin to cover the investment needed to make improvements, or even to cover maintenance costs. The park needed an infusion of attention and stable funding to accommodate the large number of visitors and to avoid impacts on adjacent neighborhoods. The 1981 Washington Park Master Plan highlighted the need to address parking, circulation and transportation concerns in the park. It is only now, with funding from the new Pay to Park system, that the resources will be available to address these long-standing challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How it works: The Pay to Park system will be similar to the parking system in place downtown with one important difference &ndash; it will be a &ldquo;pay-by-space&rdquo; system. Drivers will note their parking space number (all parking spaces in the park are now numbered) and enter that number and payment at any of the pay stations located throughout Washington Park. Pay stations can be found in the parking lots, near the attractions, and at other conveniently located spots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rates: Hourly rate is $1.60 with a $4 daily maximum during the non-peak season, and $6.40 daily maximum during peak season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seasons: Peak season is April 1st &ndash; September 30th, and non-peak season will run from October 1st &ndash; March 31st.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hours: Pay to Park hours for the southern end of Washington Park (the Vietnam Veterans of Oregon Memorial lot, the West and South lots near the Oregon Zoo area) are 9:30 AM to 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pay to Park hours for the northern end of the park (Hoyt Arboretum, Rose Garden, to northern entrances of park) 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>30 minutes free on every transaction. All pay stations will grant 30 minutes FREE on each transaction, to allow for short visits and drop-off in the park and at attractions. There is no charge to park for 30 minutes or less; though everyone will still need to enter their space number at a pay station. The free 30 minutes are automatically added to every transaction. So if you pay for an hour, you get an hour and a half.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where: The Pay to Park system will be installed in most parking space clusters throughout the park, which are:</p>
<p>The south parking lots that serve the Vietnam Veterans of Oregon Memorial, the Oregon Zoo, the Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, the World Forestry Center; and some trails into the Hoyt Arboretum;The Hoyt Arboretum parking lots;The north parking lots associated with the Japanese Garden, the International Test Rose Garden; striped parking on park roads throughout the park; and the Archery Range along SW Kingston Drive</p>

2014,499156,Portland Parks & Recreation Begins Construction of New Park in Cully Neighborhood,2,,2014-08-06 19:05:41 UTC,2014-08-06 19:04:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Groundbreaking Celebration, Park Name Revealed on Thursday, August 7</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has begun construction on the first developed park in the Cully neighborhood. Completion is expected in spring of 2015. All are welcome to a celebration of the groundbreaking on Thursday, August 7, 2014. Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz will reveal the name of the future 2.4 acre park, now being built at NE 52nd Ave. and Alberta. 1488 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by this new park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What: New park groundbreaking ceremony and name announcement<br />Where: NE 52nd Ave. &amp; Alberta<br />When: Thursday, August 7, 2014, 6:30pm &ndash; 7:30pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz will reveal the park&rsquo;s name, chosen by the project advisory committee. The event is free and all are welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to continue Commissioner Fish&rsquo;s work to provide the newest neighborhood park in a park-deficient neighborhood, one being built with strong community support and extensive neighborhood involvement,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to reveal the name. The advisory committee&rsquo;s goal in choosing the park&rsquo;s name was to find one which reflects the community&rsquo;s values of inclusion, diversity, and fun for all ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event will include Commissioner Amanda Fritz, past Parks Commissioner Nick Fish, PP&amp;R Director Mike Abbat&eacute;, a consultant team led by Greenworks PC, Cully Association of Neighbors (CAN), Hacienda CDC, elders and other members of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz, the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, Verde, partners, advocates and neighbors, PP&amp;R staff, stakeholders, and neighbors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Throughout the planning and design process, care has been taken to include the whole community. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation worked to have Spanish-language translators at open houses, committee meetings, and all other occasions. All park-related documents were translated into Spanish in order to remove longstanding barriers to participation. Planning for the park began in February, 2012, with a 12-member advisory committee. This included focus groups in partnership with the Ortiz Center and Rigler SUN School. Most recently, Hacienda CDC Expresiones worked to involve kids from under-represented communities in designing some of the exciting park features. Verde and Greenworks, PC, have participated extensively with these endeavors as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new park will be 2.4 acres. 1488 families who currently do not have access to a park or natural area (defined as a half-mile walk) will be served by this new park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project cost is approx. $2.5 million, paid for via SDCs (System Development Charges). SDCs are fees paid by developers to support the increased infrastructure required when homes and businesses are built.&nbsp; PP&amp;R purchased this property &ndash; almost two and a half acres - in 2009 to help fulfill the need for park and open space within the Cully Neighborhood. This will be the first developed park in the Cully Neighborhood, an area noted to be park-deficient. With construction beginning now, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation expects it to be ready for play in spring 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Park features include:</p>
<p>A traditional children&rsquo;s&rsquo; playground AND</p>
<p>An innovative &ldquo;nature play&rdquo; area with boulders to climb on, a slide on a hillside</p>
<p>Water feature &ndash; an interactive water play area</p>
<p>Paths for walking and jogging</p>
<p>Native plants</p>
<p>A large open lawn</p>

2013,473566,2013 Street Tree Inventory Empowers Neighbors to Care for Street Trees,2,,2013-12-13 20:41:40 UTC,2013-12-13 20:40:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong><em>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Urban Forestry Welcomes Neighborhood Applications for the 2014 Inventory</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In November, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) Urban Forestry&rsquo;s Street Tree Inventory Project wrapped up its fourth year, our biggest one yet for identifying, measuring and mapping neighborhood street trees. The program has seen tremendous growth since it began, with the 2013 efforts nearly doubling the work of all previous seasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, 30,000 street trees were identified, measured, and mapped in eight participating neighborhoods, including Arbor Lodge, Brooklyn, Cathedral Park, Downtown, Piedmont, Portsmouth, Richmond, and Woodstock. In total, 70,000 street trees have been inventoried in 17 neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Since 2009, PP&amp;R Urban Forestry has organized street tree inventories to provide neighborhoods with information and tools to better care for their street trees. Data from the inventory help neighborhoods prioritize and implement efforts for street tree management in partnership with Urban Forestry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Street trees are a vital public asset, and their care requires the active engagement of the communities that they benefit,&rdquo; says Jenn Cairo,Portland&rsquo;s City Forester. &ldquo;We want to empower neighborhoods to manage their street trees from the ground up. This inventory is a powerful tool for that. We&rsquo;re collecting important data for management and forming community tree teams in the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIGHLIGHTS OF 2013 INVENTORY FINDINGS:</p>
<p>Total annual benefits provided by street trees range from $108,000 to $651,000 for each neighborhood. Benefits include energy savings, stormwater processing, and property value increases.Replacement values for neighborhood street tree populations range from $4 -$20 million.Norwayand red maple, pear, cherry, and plum are the most common trees across all neighborhoods.Only two neighborhoods met recommended guidelines for species diversity: Ports&shy;mouth and Woodstock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planting a diversity of species reduces risk from pests and diseases. Maples are widely overrepresented at the species, genus, and family level. The rose family (Rosaceae) is also overrepresented, particularly in neighborhoods where many small planting sites exist.Half of all street trees are young (less than 6&rdquo; in diameter).Over 12,000 spaces have been identified for tree planting across all neighborhoods. No neighborhood (excluding Downtown) is stocked more than 69%.</p>
<p>The street tree inventory program is largely volunteer-driven, and 250 volunteers donated over 4,000 hours to the project this year. Volunteers organized neighborhood tree teams, collected street tree data at neighborhood workdays, offered professional expertise as arborists, and entered data at the Urban Forestry office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complete inventory results, recommendations, and maps for each neighborhood are available at <a href=""/parks/treeinventory"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/treeinventory</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEXT STEPS:</p>
<p>On November 9, 2013, 100 participants convened at an annual Tree Summit at St. John&rsquo;s Community Center to hear inventory findings, discuss results, and begin creating neighborhood tree management plans. Over the next year, Urban Forestry will support neighborhoods in implementing their plans. Possible management action items include pruning workshops, increased planting efforts, and homeowner education and outreach around topics such as species diversity and young tree care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peninsula Park and Peninsula Park Community Center recently celebrated 100 years of serving our city. The all-volunteer Friends of Peninsula Park Rose Garden (FOPPRG) and our valued non-profit partner Portland Parks Foundation are proud partners in the centennial celebration and projects.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Theatre's support of the Portland Parks &amp; Recreation documentary project has given young people the chance to learn filmmaking skills while celebrating 100 years of Portland&rsquo;s first community center and public rose gardens at Peninsula Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""The class, held through Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and using cameras and sound equipment provided by The Hollywood Theatre, began with lectures and experiments in film techniques. Instructors Billy Miller and Carlos Lasuncet taught the boys the best way to frame a shot. They coached them to position interview subjects at an angle so their scenes won't look flat. And they taught them how to ask questions that will yield stories, not yes or no answers.""</p>
<p>-OregonLive, March 3, 2013</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students spent weeks interviewing Portland Parks &amp; Recreation experts and filming video of the city's oldest rose garden with guidance from the pros. Miller is a professional filmmaker who teaches film at da Vinci Arts Middle School. Lasunce is a science, music and film teacher at Open Meadow School.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admission is free at the December 29 screening. PeninsulaParkCommunity Center staffers are holding a canned food drive to benefit the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s Sunshine Division, as well as a coat drive for Trillium Family Services. Moviegoers will enjoy a panel discussion featuring the teen filmmakers, and light refreshments will be served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Parks Foundation and Friends of Peninsula Park Rose Garden (FOPPRG) are teaming up for a raffle on site. The Friends group, made up solely of volunteers dedicated to caring for Portland&rsquo;s oldest public rose garden, will also graciously accept donations.</p>

<p>About the Pay to Park system:</p>
<p>- Currently, non-members of the Oregon Zoo,Portland ChildrenMuseum, andWorldForestryCenteralready pay $4 per vehicle at the gates of those attractions. This rate has been in effect for a number of years, and is consistent with the new universal (park-wide) Pay to Park system.</p>
<p>-The biggest difference between the paid parking system utilized downtown and the Pay to Park system coming at Washington Park is the pay-by-space method in the park. The Pay to Park system begins January 10, 2014.</p>
<p>-Visitors will enter their parking space number and payment at any pay station in Washington Park.</p>
<p>-There are 30 minutes free on every transaction; though visitors must still enter your space number.</p>
<p>-Visitors can extend their stay if needed at any pay station in the park, by entering their parking space number and payment.</p>
<p>-You can choose to pay a flat daily rate or use the hourly option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2012, Portland City Council unanimously directed Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) to establish the new Pay to Park system to provide for safer and better service to park visitors, and to address long-standing deferred maintenance issues. Metro Council also authorized the measure. PP&amp;R has worked closely with all the attractions in the park to make the transition to this new Pay to Park system as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>As the population of the Portland metro area has grown over the past few decades, the numbers of visitors to Washington Park and its paid attractions have steadily increased, too. Today, an estimated 3 million people visit the park each year. Yet its transportation system hasn&rsquo;t kept pace and the city&rsquo;s dwindling park funds can&rsquo;t begin to cover the investment needed to make improvements, or even to cover maintenance costs. The park needed an infusion of attention and stable funding to accommodate the large number of visitors and to avoid impacts on adjacent neighborhoods. The 1981 Washington Park Master Plan highlighted the need to address parking, circulation and transportation concerns in the park. It is only now, with funding from the new Pay to Park system, that the resources will be available to address these long-standing challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How it works: The Pay to Park system will be similar to the parking system in place downtown with one important difference &ndash; it will be a &ldquo;pay-by-space&rdquo; system. Drivers will note their parking space number (all parking spaces in the park are now numbered) and enter that number and payment at any of the pay stations located throughout Washington Park. Pay stations can be found in the parking lots, near the attractions, and at other conveniently located spots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rates: Hourly rate is $1.60 with a $4 daily maximum during the non-peak season, and $6.40 daily maximum during peak season.</p>
<p>Seasons: Peak season is April 1st &ndash; September 30th, and non-peak season will run from October 1st &ndash; March 31st.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hours: Pay to Park hours for the southern end of Washington Park (the Vietnam Veterans of Oregon Memorial lot, the West and South lots near the Oregon Zoo area) are 9:30 AM to 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>Pay to Park hours for the northern end of the park (Hoyt Arboretum, Rose Garden, to northern entrances of park) 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>30 minutes free on every transaction. All pay stations will grant 30 minutes FREE on each transaction, to allow for short visits and drop-off in the park and at attractions. There is no charge to park for 30 minutes or less; though everyone will still need to enter their space number at a pay station. The free 30 minutes are automatically added to every transaction. So if you pay for an hour, you get an hour and a half.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where: The Pay to Park system will be installed in most parking space clusters throughout the park, which are:</p>
<p>The south parking lots that serve the Vietnam Veterans of Oregon Memorial, the Oregon Zoo, the Portland Children&rsquo;s Museum, the World Forestry Center; and some trails into the Hoyt Arboretum; the Hoyt Arboretum parking lots; the park's north parking lots associated with the Japanese Garden, the International Test Rose Garden; striped parking on park roads throughout the park; and the Archery Range along SW Kingston Drive</p>

<p><strong><em>Construction Scheduled to Finish in the summer of 2014</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland) -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of the Portland community gathered at Dawson Park on Thursday, November 14, at 11:00 a.m. to celebrate the start of construction to restore the park as a key community gathering space while honoring its rich African-American history. The $2.6 million renovation project will make the park more welcoming and attractive, with an improved playground, interactive water play feature, barbeques, picnic tables and benches, and better lighting and accessibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dawson Park, located between N. Vancouver and Williams avenues and N. Stanton and Morris streets, has served as an integral social, political and economic center for many communities &ndash; most notably, Portland&rsquo;s African-American community. The neighborhood around Dawson once was the heart of Portland&rsquo;s African-American population, and the new park design will recognize that heritage with double-sided cast-stone medallions designed by artist Isaka Shamsud-Din to be placed in a decorative fence surrounding the playground. One side will be inspired by traditional African Ndebele patterns; the other side will contain historic neighborhood remembrances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PDC Executive Director Patrick Quinton said, &ldquo;Dawson Park is more than just a park&mdash;it&rsquo;s a symbol of this neighborhood, North-Northeast Portland and our constant vision for a better city. These improvements are truly community-driven and we are honored to play a role in the revitalization of this community asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is gratifying to see the beginning of dramatic and tangible park improvements,&rdquo; says Michael Alexander, President and CEO of the Urban League of Portland. &ldquo;It is important to deeply understand the history here, while still focusing on the future. We look forward to a tremendous new park and appreciate the commitment by the City and its partners to increase the quality of life here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dawson Park is widely treasured and has a deep history,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;And what we are doing today is about making more history. I am thrilled that Dawson Park is being re-energized, and proud to see our City working to make it a vibrant part of the community once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legacy Emanuel was founded more than 100 years ago, just across the street from Dawson Park, on the concept of caring for the people in this neighborhood,&rdquo; says Dr. Lori Morgan, Chief Administrative Officer, Legacy Emanuel Medical Center. &ldquo;We are proud to have contributed to Dawson Park&rsquo;s new water play feature where children and adults alike can appreciate the outdoors and be active. Our staff, patients and their families are looking forward to enjoying Dawson Park once again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is a partnership between the Portland Development Commission (PDC) and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. The Interstate Corridor Urban Renewal Area will provide $2.3 million in funding, with remaining support for the water play feature from Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, Portland Parks Foundation and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Support for the public artwork comes from the Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council. R&amp;R General Contractors has been selected to construct the park improvements; 87% of the construction work will be performed by MWDESB-certified contractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction is expected to run from October 2013 through June 2014.</p>

2013,470042,Portland Parks & Recreation Announces Improved Access to USS Oregon,2,,2013-11-08 23:59:23 UTC,2013-11-08 23:58:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>World War II Battleship Memorial Benefits from Enhancements improving Accessibility for All</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has completed a project to enhance access to the USS Oregon Memorial in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Waterfront Park. The mast of the historic battleship USS Oregon is showcased in this popular and visible park to commemorate those who served during World War II. PP&amp;R has improved access to and throughout the memorial with an ADA-accessible ramp and walkways, which can be easily used by people in wheelchairs and therefore increase access for visitors with limited mobility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without the ramp and accessibility improvements that have been made to the USS Oregon memorial, I was restricted to seeing it from a distance,&rdquo; says Travis Herseim, an Army veteran. &ldquo;That forced me to be one of the outside looking in people. Now I - and any other individuals with disabilities - can get right up to the memorial and be part of regular society. Being included in the things that society takes for granted means a lot to those who can&rsquo;t take movement and mobility for granted anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Commission on Disability asked Commissioner Amanda Fritz to address the accessibility issues at the memorial when she was assigned to lead PP&amp;R in June. &ldquo;It was highly meaningful to me that one of my first actions as Parks Commissioner carried on my previous work with the Office of Equity and Human Rights and the Commission on Disability,&rdquo; said Commissioner Fritz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thankful for Commissioner Fritz&rsquo;s strong support for this project and pleased with the speed and attention given to this project by the Parks Bureau,&rdquo; said Joe VanderVeer, Chair of the Commission on Disability. &ldquo;We appreciate the participation of the veteran community, as well, in moving this project forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project work includes an ADA-accessible ramp and walkways on the north and south sides of the memorial, as well as some new landscaping features. Additional signage to improve accessibility for people experiencing visual disabilities will be added before the project is deemed complete. The USS Oregon Memorial is located inPortlandParks &amp; RecreationWaterfrontParkbetween SW Pine and Oak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the re-opening of the improved memorial will be held at the site on Veterans Day, Monday November 11, 2013 at 2:30 p.m. Veterans and members of the Portland Commission on Disability will participate, along with Commissioner Fritz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>History of the Memorial</p>
<p>The Battleship Oregon Memorial was built in 1956 to honor WW II veterans, and the 1893 ship that was nicknamed 'the Bulldog of the United States Navy' and fought in many famous battles before it was retired from service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 4, 1976, a time capsule was sealed in the base of the memorial. The time capsule is to be opened July 5, 2076</p>

<p><strong><em>Help Keep Parks, Schoolyards, Healthy for All Users</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Portland Public Schools are encouraging dog owners to show good &ldquo;petiquette&rdquo; when visiting parks and schoolyards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parks and schoolyards are used for many different kinds of play, from soccer to jogging to dodgeball to biking,&rdquo; says Ali Ryan, who manages PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Dog Off-Leash Program. &ldquo;The best ways dog owners can contribute to maintaining safe, healthy places for play are by keeping dogs on leash and removing pet waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Off-leash dogs in sports fields, playgrounds, and other leash-only areas is an ongoing concern for many park and school visitors. By law, dogs are required to be on leash in all public spaces including parks and schoolyards. Pet waste must also be removed and disposed of properly. Pet owners who don&rsquo;t leash and scoop risk citations of up to $150.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has 33 designated off-leash areas in parks throughout the city. Dogs on leash are welcome visitors to schoolyards during non-school hours and most parks, trails and natural areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As year-round, all-weather users, dog owners can have a great, positive presence,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Security Manager Art Hendricks. &ldquo;But their presence is just as positive, and much safer for all park users and pets, when dogs are kept on leash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To report leash/scoop problems in parks, contact Portland Park Rangers at 503-823-1637. To report leash/scoop problems in schoolyards, contact Multnomah County Animal Services at 503-988-PETS (7387).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(UPDATED THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10)</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation crews have finished removing debris and addressing damage at our Kelley Point Park.&nbsp; The park is now open again for all vehicles in all permitted areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># # # </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last weekend's heavy rains have caused safety concerns on the park roads at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation's Kelley Point Park (N. Marine Drive and N. Lombard). The non-stop rain and wind uprooted several trees, and their integrity is in doubt as they lean over above the pavement.&nbsp; Therefore, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has closed Kelley Point Park today (Friday, October 4, 2013) to all visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect to reopen the park tomorrow, with vehicle traffic restricted to no further than the park's primary parking lot, until our Urban Forestry team can address the situation.&nbsp; People walking or biking in the park when it reopens are advised to be aware of the potential hazards and proceed with caution.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/article/466071

<p>Lots of questions about PP&amp;R ballfield and sports field closures which&nbsp;we are&nbsp;now able to answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s going on? Which sports fields are we talking about?</strong></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) made the call that City of Portland/PP&amp;R fields; the ones users book through PP&amp;R via permits; will be closed through Thursday due to the extremely heavy rains we experienced the last few days. On Thursday morning (10/3) we&rsquo;ll look at the sites and re-evaluate conditions then. So depending on how they are then, fields might possibly open on that day; we will see; if conditions hold fields would certainly be open for the coming weekend.</p>
<p>PPS is not involved. Closing PPS fields would be their call; never been done in the past to our knowledge. We have a couple unaffected fields actually on PPS property &ndash; the just-completed all-weather Grant HS field (talk about good timing) and Buckman Field, which is also all-weather, so those two are fine.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there a list of the fields available</strong>?</p>
<p>I thought you might ask:</p>
<p><a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?ShowResults=yes&amp;SearchText=sports"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/finder/index.cfm?ShowResults=yes&amp;SearchText=sports</a></p>
<p>So if it&rsquo;s a PP&amp;R park and it has a field, it&rsquo;s closed right now. (Sports fields are where you&rsquo;d play soccer lacrosse or rugby; ballfields are for baseball or softball)</p>
<p>A few examples: Overlook Park; 2 soccer and 1 baseball 1 softball, all closed</p>
<p>Gabriel park 2 baseball 2 soft 3 soccer fields all closed</p>
<p>Lents Park &ndash;ballfields and sports fields closed</p>
<p>Westmoreland very wet &ndash; 5 ballfields, 4 sport fields. Can&rsquo;t walk in the outfield without sinking a few inches</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is the issue on the fields?</strong></p>
<p>The problem is oversaturation. Even if a field looks ok at a glance, or driving by,&nbsp;you'll find that&nbsp;once you start running, you can create dangerous slippery mud spots; your foot sinks a few inches in a particularly wet spot and gets stuck, can get really hurt. Secondary concern is conditions of the fields.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oh man&hellip;Does this mean no Friday night football?</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a PPS question; closing their fields would be their call; but we can&rsquo;t recall that ever happening. Please contact PPS</p>
<p>When will PP&amp;R revisit the fields; might they reopen sooner?</p>
<p>Thursday Oct 3; on that morning we&rsquo;ll look at the fields and re-evaluate. Might possibly open on that day; we will see; if conditions hold, fields will certainly be open this coming weekend if not Friday too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How many users/permittees/leagues are affected? How are they being notified?</strong></p>
<p>There are approximately 206 active field permits issued to about 50 adult and youth user groups.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R Customer Service will send an email to all affected groups.</p>
<p>Portland Youth Soccer cancelled 129 soccer games last weekend due to storm; so that gives you an idea of the scope. They practice and play throughout the week; plus adult groups; etc. The rains have washed out a lot of playing time, but luckily it&rsquo;s just temporary. Hoping for dry days starting&hellip;now.</p>

2013,465374,Join Portland Parks & Recreation for the 10th Annual No Ivy Day!,2,,2013-09-30 21:20:56 UTC,2013-09-30 21:19:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Citywide Celebrations and Volunteer Efforts on Saturday, October 5</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), the No Ivy League and volunteers across the region invite you to take part in the 10th annual No Ivy Day, city-wide on Saturday, October 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help rid PP&amp;R parks and natural areas from an invasive species by taking part in city-wide work parties to remove English ivy. The non-native plant overcomes native species and mature ivy vines may threaten trees in many of our forests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The efforts of volunteers and the No Ivy League are essential to the health of our beautiful parks and natural areas,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;As stewards of our parks and natural areas, we appreciate the engagement of our community partners to remove this invasive plant. The grassroots efforts of our neighbors have had a visible, positive effect on our green spaces, and I look forward to these efforts continuing - even bigger and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>City nature experts say it is important to remove maturing ivy during the fall to reduce the amount of seed produced through the winter, slowing its spread to unaffected areas. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Marshall Park, Marquam Nature Park and Forest Park have seen vast improvements in tree health in places where ivy was recently cleared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During last year&rsquo;s No Ivy Day, more than 160 volunteers cleared ivy from nearly 400 trees, and pulled over 31,000 square feet of choking vines. The hope is to accomplish even more this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work parties across Portland run from 9:00 AM to noon, followed by a celebration for all volunteers at Lower Macleay Park, 2960 NW Upshur St., from 12:30-2:00 PM. All volunteers are invited to take part after the citywide work parties. The celebration will feature environmental activities, refreshments, free T-shirts, ivy basket weaving and inspiring words from City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come show your support for our native ecosystem by joining a work party at one of 12 sites throughout the region, or by registering to host your own No Ivy Day site.</p>
<p>Please check the No Ivy Day 2013 link for more information at www.noivyleague.com. We must work together to maintain the health of our natural environment.</p>

<p><em><strong>Work and Limited Closures Begin October 7 to Restore Eroded Section</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work will begin on Monday, October 7, to repair a section of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Springwater Corridor Trail about a mile south of the Ross Island Bridge that was damaged by erosion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning October 7 and ending November 15, a portion of the trail between milepost 1.5 and milepost 1.75 will be closed from 9am to 4pm each Monday through Friday. There will be no public access to that section of trail during these construction hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that many people use the trail for commuting and recreation, PP&amp;R has worked to ensure that the trail will be open for use before 9am and after 4pm on weekdays; as well as all day on weekends. Walkers, runners and cyclists should continue to use caution through the construction area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT: Section of Springwater Corridor Trail closed for repair; please use before 9am or after 4pm Monday-Friday</p>
<p>WHERE: Milepost 1.5-milepost 1.75</p>
<p>WHEN: Closed October 7-November 15 from 9am to 4pm. Monday&ndash;Fridays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has planned the construction timing to allow commuter and recreation access in the morning before 9am and in the evening after 4pm, when crews are not working. In order to maintain this limited access, we need your help. Please plan enough time to pass through the construction zone before the trail section closes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Springwater Corridor Trail project will fix an eroded section of the trail impacted due to an unforeseen emergency. The solution to the erosion has proven to be a unique fix dependent on weather conditions, funding, and complex permitting. PP&amp;R has been working on the erosion repair solution and trail restoration project since it became a problem due to unusually hard, prolonged rain and high river water in March 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s goals have been, and continue to be to initiate and complete repairs and reinforcement as soon as possible. A number of complex permits are required, which mandate environmentally-sensitive solutions.&nbsp; PP&amp;R&rsquo;s goal is to stabilize the slide, and make the trail fully operational again; while taking steps to protect the riverbank. We want to also ensure that the bottom of the riverbank does not wash out once again in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Erosion began in March 2012 on an approximately 100-foot section of the Springwater Corridor Trail south of theRossIslandBridge. PP&amp;R put up cones in April when the asphalt path cracked due to the slide, along with sandbags and plastic sheeting. Currently, the trail is open for use, but with only one lane available at the affected area. Users are urged to proceed with caution so that all may pass safely from both directions. PP&amp;R continues working on a plan for both an immediate repair to the area, as well as a longer-term solution that will reinforce about 1000 feet of the nearby riverbank below the trail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details on planned repairs:<br />The repairs and reinforcement of the riverbank slope will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will stabilize the slope and rebuild the trail to make it fully functional and safe. This will involve a so-called &ldquo;soft solution&rdquo; which will provide riparian wildlife habitat as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The soft solution involves soil wrapped by natural weaved fibers secured to the slope by soil anchors and vegetated with natural plantings. The second phase, which is currently unfunded, will occur sometime in the future using vertical wooden piles driven into the river bottom to hold logs and root wad supports in place, further ballasted by a mixture of boulders and natural wooden enforcements. Planting vegetation will enhance habitat and provide additional stability at the very bottom of the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated total project cost is $650,000. Special thanks to Metro, which is contributing a matching grant of up to $400,000 towards the project. The City o of Portland will cover the remaining costs, and has retained GeoStabilization International (GSI) as the contractor for the project.</p>

2013,463679,Portland Parks & Recreation’s Multnomah Arts Center Gallery Receives Total Makeover Thanks to Generous Support from Local Businesses,2,,2013-09-23 16:08:38 UTC,2013-09-16 16:58:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major gallery renovation at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Multnomah Arts Center (MAC) has just been completed, thanks to significant donated work and in-kind support from area businesses and partners. SERA Architects, Mortenson Construction, and Cascade Acoustics each committed generous contributions of funds and labor to make the gallery restoration possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;SERA is committed to helping non-profit organizations that positively impact Portland in the fields of arts, culture and education,&rdquo; says Gauri Rajbaidya, who led this project at SERA Architects. &ldquo;The gallery renovation for Multnomah Arts Center was a perfect opportunity for us to help the Multnomah Arts Association Board and make a contribution to our community. The Arts Center didn&rsquo;t have the capital for the project, so we were happy to bring together design and construction professionals to provide the pro-bono work needed to make the vision a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional support has been provided from Rosendin Electric, Fine Painting, Performance Abatement Services, Temp Control Mechanical, Viking Automatic Sprinklers, KPFF Structural and Civil Engineering, PAE Consulting Engineering, Solus Lighting, and Northern Illumination Company. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and MAC thank them for their collective leadership, generosity, and vision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collaborations such as this between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and our valued area partners make it possible to enhance Portlanders&rsquo; quality of life in a time of limited public resources,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We are proud of the steadfast support these community businesses have provided. This initiative has resulted in a beautiful gallery that generations of Portlanders will enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the past 30 years, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s MAC gallery has showcased the artwork of more than 300 regional artists, arts collectives, and group shows. In that time, more than 100,000 visitors have enjoyed the creativity of emerging and established professional artists from the region.</p>
<p>After three decades of heavy traffic in the gallery, the Multnomah Arts Center Association (MACA), an all-volunteer nonprofit organization that supports the mission of MAC, made it a priority to renovate the popular gallery space into a beautiful state-of-the-art venue that is flexible, professional and displays a wide variety of art in different forms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COME SEE THE NEW GALLERY!</p>
<p>The first show in the new &amp; improved Multnomah Arts Center Gallery is up now and will run through October 2. &ldquo;Ceramics from the Snow Mountain Kiln&rdquo; is a group show of wood fired ceramics by artists Lew Allen,Lori Allen, Rob Lamb, and Mark Prieto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the MAC Gallery Renovation:</p>
<p>Total value of donated design, labor, and in-kind materials: $118,300Approximate number of hours of donated time: 1,200In addition to the business community&rsquo;s demonstrated support, more than 100 community members have donated funds exceeding $10,500.&nbsp; By converting to LED lights and advanced dimming controls, the MAC will reduce energy usage in the gallery by more than 50%, while providing far better quality and adaptability to different art media.</p>
<p>There will be a reception for the MAC Instructor Show on November 1, 5-7pm. This will include the dedication of a permanent gallery plaque recognizing the generous supporters of the renovation. The work of MAC partners and supporters will have an enduring impact on the local arts community.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>Erosion began in March 2012 on an approximately 100-foot section of the Springwater Corridor Trail south of the Ross Island Bridge. PP&amp;R put up cones in April when the asphalt path cracked due to the slide, along with sandbags and plastic sheeting. Currently, the trail is open for use, but with only one lane available at the affected area. Users are urged to proceed with caution so that all may pass safely from both directions. PP&amp;R continues working on a plan for both an immediate repair to the area, as well as a longer-term solution that will reinforce about 1000 feet of the nearby riverbank below the trail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details on planned repairs:<br />The repairs and reinforcement of the riverbank slope will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will stabilize the slope and rebuild the trail to make it fully functional and safe. This will involve a so-called &ldquo;soft solution&rdquo; which will provide riparian wildlife habitat as well.</p>
<p>The soft solution involves soil wrapped by natural weaved fibers secured to the slope by soil anchors and vegetated with natural plantings. The second phase, which is currently unfunded, will occur sometime in the future using vertical wooden piles driven into the river bottom to hold logs and root wad supports in place, further ballasted by a mixture of boulders and natural wooden enforcements. Planting vegetation will enhance habitat and provide additional stability at the very bottom of the bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The estimated total project cost is $650,000. Special thanks to Metro, which is contributing a matching grant of up to $400,000 towards the project. The City of Portland will cover the remaining costs, and has retained GeoStabilization International (GSI) as the contractor for the project.</p>

2013,462977,"Commissioners Fritz, Novick Team up to Look For a Solution to Save NE Portland’s Historic Rayworth House",2,,2013-09-06 21:58:08 UTC,2013-09-06 21:57:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Commissioners Amanda Fritz (Development Services, Parks &amp; Recreation) and Steve Novick (Transportation) announce a new timeline for the preservation of the historic Rayworth House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City offers special thanks to neighborhood advocates Roy and Kim Fox, who committed to saving the home, located on Albina St., and have made a significant financial and emotional investment in preserving the historic structure. Further, the City offers special thanks to developer Andre Koshuba who has graciously granted several needed extensions to avoid demolishing the house. Commissioners Fritz and Novick are also appreciative of the advocacy of Boise Neighborhood Association.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complications arose yesterday (Thursday, September 5) when City staff learned that the height of the home during its cross-town move was actually three and a half feet taller than previously indicated in the permitting process. This information, coming less than 72 hours before the home was to be moved, raised significant concerns over vital infrastructure issues such as traffic impacts, utility/electric and communication line impacts, and on impacts to both private and City-owned trees.</p>
<p>This change necessitates a new route for a potential move and new permits. Property developer Andre Koshuba has agreed to a one-week delay of demolition to allow for additional route planning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fritz, Novick and City staff will continue to work with all parties to find a new or modified route that minimizes impacts on traffic, gives advance notification of impacted neighbors, and includes a thorough assessment of utility/electric and communication line issues and the structural and safety-related impacts to both privately- and City-owned trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone wants to make this move happen, in a manner that protects neighbors and the house,&rdquo; says City Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;I very much appreciate the efforts of Mr. and Mrs. Fox, of Mr. Koshuba, of Pat Brady of Emmert International, and everyone involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Novick praised the work of staff from the several bureaus to work together to try to find a way to relocate the house while protecting infrastructure the community depends on every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Transportation Bureau has to protect the trees, power lines and traffic signals that are in the public right-of-way,&rdquo; Novick said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we may be able to find a way to preserve this house, which reflects the character and charm of Portland. But all parties need to continue to work together to protect the utilities and other infrastructure that are essential to our quality of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The home is believed to have been built in 1890 by Edwin Rayworth. It went into foreclosure in 2010.&nbsp; Koshuba, the developer, then bought it and plans to replace it with a pair of homes on the Rayworth property&rsquo;s existing site.</p>

2013,462715,Portland Parks & Recreation Moves Forward on New Park in Cully Neighborhood,2,,2013-09-05 16:53:43 UTC,2013-09-05 16:52:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Construction of First Developed Neighborhood Park in Cully Expected to Start Next Spring</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is pleased that the planning for the first developed neighborhood park in the Portland&rsquo;s Cully area is proceeding as anticipated. PP&amp;R expects that construction on the park, located on NE 52nd between NE Alberta St and NE Wygant, will begin in spring of 2014. We estimate the 2.4 acre project will be complete by spring 2015 to help fulfill the need for park and open space within the Cully Neighborhood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completion of the new park will create an eagerly awaited neighborhood gathering place in the heart of an area that needs it most. The Cully Neighborhood is a culturally diverse area that is home to more than 13,000 residents with a mix of commercial and relatively dense residential development. The all-volunteer Cully Association of Neighbors (CAN) continues to be an instrumental partner in drawing attention to the needs of the neighborhood. CAN has an important and vital commitment to the park&rsquo;s planning and development. The group is also involved with planning the future Thomas Cully Park on NE 72nd Ave., along with other area partnerships including the recent expansion of Sacajawea Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""It is very exciting that the Cully neighborhood will finally have a fully developed park suited for all ages for our diverse community,&rdquo; says Kathy Fuerstenau, CAN chairwoman. &ldquo;This park will be a special gathering place where individuals and families can go to play and relax. For many years, the Cully Association of Neighbors has been diligently advocating for improvements to the parks in Cully. We are pleased that our partnership helped to bring this one to fruition.""</p>
<p>City Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz lauds the broad community support the new park has seen from day one, and continues to see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The planning for this park has involved input from a broad range of community members,&rdquo; says Fritz. &ldquo;We thank them and our partners for their continued investment in the park. Their support for the park&rsquo;s design and excitement for the finished park is tangible. I eagerly await the results of their efforts, commitment and leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For project updates on the new park on the Cully neighborhood, please visit the PP&amp;R project page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the park</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s design includes a playground, picnic shelter plus other picnic tables around the park, lights, park benches, a nature play area including a slide, native trees and plants, climbing boulders, a large grassy lawn, rainwater drainage features, on-street parking, and west and north-side curb, street and sidewalk improvements to allow people to safely walk the park&rsquo;s perimeter. The park will also feature a small, beginner-level skateboard area known as a Skate Dot. The location will allow this feature to be easily seen and accessed from NE Alberta St. The Skate Dot is designed primarily for kids ages 5-12, but can also be used by other beginner skaters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valerie Otani is an artist and sculptor who has collaborated with design teams to incorporate her artwork into natural areas, parks, recreational facilities and urban centers. Otani views public art as a way to connect people to a site. PP&amp;R has asked her to be involved with the design process from the early stages, in order to explore artistic themes and gestures. We hope her input helps make the park a calm, memorable place which is tied culturally to the Cully community. The Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT) will be designing, and constructing street improvements along the park&rsquo;s border with NE Alberta &amp; NE 52nd Ave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new park&rsquo;s Master Plan was a collaborative effort between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, the Cully community, and the Project Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>The design team for the park is headed up by Greenworks P.C. Landscape Architecture includes; KPFF Engineering, Reyes Electrical, Evergreen Skate Parks, Verde Community Youth Engagement and artist Valerie Otani among others. Greenworks designed the master plan for the park and will oversee the design process from now until completion. Portland non-profit Verde is a partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public is invited to a meeting to learn more about the park&rsquo;s features and for an update on the development process; particularly the young children&rsquo;s skateboard area known as the Skate Dot.</p>

<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Friends of Mt. Tabor Park (FMTP) are preparing for the 10,000th guest at the volunteer-staffed visitor center at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mt. Tabor Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mt. Tabor Visitor Center, conceived and operated by Friends of Mt. Tabor Park (FMTP) has now been open most weekends and selected weekdays for 19 months (since November, 2011). Based upon FMTP&rsquo;s visitor count, the center will host its 10,000th visitor on Saturday, August 10, 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;10,000 visitors is a milestone that shows how valuable this Friends of Mt. Tabor endeavor is for the park, our visitors, and the City as a whole,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;A sincere congratulations to Friends of Mount Tabor for this remarkable achievement. Here&rsquo;s to the next 10,000!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Friends of Mt Tabor Park will host a free, public celebration at the Mt. Tabor Visitor Center on Saturday, August 10 from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. Cake will be served, and the eagerly anticipated 10,000th visitor will receive gifts courtesy of FMTP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guests come by from all over the world,&rdquo; remarks Dave Hillman of Friends of Mt. Tabor Park. &ldquo;Last weekend we had a family from Copenhagen, a group from Hungary, a guest from Indonesia, another from northern England, several from numerous states and Canada, not to mention all over the greater Portland area. We seem to be a world destination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inspired by a similar venture at the Hoyt Arboretum, the Mt.Tabor Visitor Center was created out of an existing Portland Parks &amp;</p>
<p>Recreation building, and is staffed by FMTP volunteers. The non-profit Portland Parks Foundation fully supports FMTP&rsquo;s efforts in creating and maintaining the center. &nbsp;The Mt. Tabor Visitor Center can be accessed by entering the park at SE 60th &amp; Salmon. The visitor center is located adjacent to the main parking lot, next to the Crater Amphitheater. The Portland Water Bureau graciously provided furniture for the center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The center is open weekends from 10am-3pm, and at times during the week. For more info on hours please email <a href=""mailto:davehillman@comcast.net"">davehillman@comcast.net</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visitors to the new center may take free brochures, view a wall of historical photos, and pick up walking maps. More brochures on area geology, plants, trees, and wildlife are being planned for the near future.&nbsp; Friends of Mt. Tabor Park is a volunteer friends group and partner of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. Members conduct foot patrols and stewardship at Mt. Tabor Park. They recognize that Mt.Tabor Park is a Portland landmark and a destination park for Rose City neighbors and visitors.</p>

2013,456152,Reservoir Demonstration at Mt. Tabor Park Expected to be Peaceful,2,,2013-07-12 18:24:46 UTC,2013-07-12 18:20:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>City bureaus encourage demonstrators to be good stewards of one of Portland&rsquo;s historic parks and the City&rsquo;s drinking water</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland,OR&ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and the Portland Water Bureau expect a peaceful, unpermitted demonstration on Friday, July 12 at historic Mt.TaborPark, located at SE 60th Avenue andSE Salmon Street. The bureaus are aware that demonstrators plan to gather at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonstrators are concerned about a federal mandate from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that requires the City of Portland to cover its drinking water reservoirs to protect against any contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2006, the City has repeatedly sought to delay or avoid the LT2 mandate, but a federal court and the Oregon Health Authority have consistently rejected these appeals. Faced with a lack of further legal options and with deadlines looming, the City is moving forward with compliance, which includes disconnecting Mt.Tabor open-air reservoirs once new enclosed reservoirs at Powell Butte and Kelly Butte are completed. The deadline to disconnect the Mt.Tabor reservoirs is Dec. 31, 2015. A June 2013 statement with more information on the City&rsquo;s fight against LT2 can be found here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We welcome people who wish to assemble peacefully and exercise their first amendment rights,&rdquo; stated Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;We ask that demonstrators who come to Mt.Tabor to express their views also respect the park and follow park rules, so that everyone can enjoy it safely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to be clear that the City&rsquo;s primary responsibility must be to protect the safety of our drinking water. The water in Mt.Tabor&rsquo;s open reservoirs goes directly to half of Portland&rsquo;s households, and we will take all necessary steps to keep it safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is responsible for the protection and public enjoyment of our parks. The Parks bureau and Portland police have reached out to organizers of the planned demonstration. While organizers have refused to secure a permit for the event, the demonstration is expected to be peaceful. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will be educating demonstrators on park rules and good stewardship of our public land and its vegetation. Mt.Tabor Park opens at 5:00 a.m. and closes at 12:00 a.m.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the members of the City Council support free speech activities,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;Those activities must be balanced with every Portlander&rsquo;s right to access clean and safe parks in every neighborhood including Mt.Tabor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PP&amp;R is the steward of these public lands and it is our responsibility to protect the park and its natural areas. I am hoping for a peaceful event where people exercise their right to free expression mindful of the need to maintain our parks and water resources for the benefit of all Portlanders. I ask that demonstrators respect the special day for the couples holding weddings in the park this weekend. I hope Mt.Tabor Park, with its historic reservoirs and magnificent views, will continue to be a great location for weddings and other events for many generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R asks all visitors to help us to be good stewards of the park by adhering to applicable rules including but not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No camping (City Code 14A.50.020)</p>
<p>No structures are allowed without a permit (City Code 14A.50.050 and 20.12.080)</p>
<p>Properly dispose of any trash (City Code 20.12.090)</p>
<p>Protect the park and park vegetation (City Code 20.12.100)</p>

<p>Protect Portland&rsquo;s drinking water supply; do not throw or deposit anything into any of the reservoirs (City Code 14A.50.130)</p>
<p>Please adhere to park hours. No one shall be in Mt. Tabor during the hours of park closure; the park will be closed from 12:01 a.m. to 5 a.m. (20.12.210)</p>

<p><em><strong>Public/Private Partnership to Construct All-Weather Turf Field with Lights</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Portland City Council approved an exciting partnership between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R), the Portland Timbers and Portland Thorns FC and Delta Development, LLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz introduced the partnership, along with PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Todd Lofgren, Portland Timbers &amp; Portland Thorns FC Chief Operating Officer Mike Golub, Timbers &amp; Thorns General Manager Gavin Wilkinson, Thorns FC defender Rachel Buehler and Timbers defender David Horst. The ordinance was unanimously approved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Timbers and Thorns FC will be the lead funding partners in converting a grass soccer field at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Delta Park into a synthetic turf field complete with lights. Portland&rsquo;s pro soccer teams will use the new field and nearby building space (to be constructed as part of the project) for practices, for Timbers Academy program development, and for coaches&rsquo; training. When not reserved for these purposes, the field, locker rooms and restrooms will be available for the public by permit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction is expected to start in August of 2013, with the field scheduled for completion in fall of 2013. Completion of the adjacent building is expected by spring of 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Portland Timbers and Portland Thorns FC have established a standard of excellence in community engagement both on and off the pitch,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;We are very happy that this significant project is moving forward to improve Delta Park for all users. Public-private partnerships like this help make our City and our award-winning park system continue to thrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An adjacent building at Delta Park will be updated with brand-new locker rooms and restroom facilities for field users as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R will provide $100,000 to the cost of the project via System Development Charges (SDC&rsquo;s) from development fees (not General Fund tax dollars). PP&amp;R will also provide design and construction oversight staff costs. The Portland Timbers and Portland Thorns FC will generously contribute the remaining funds, currently estimated at $1.1 million dollars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted to partner with Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and add an important piece to the training infrastructure for the Thorns, Timbers U-23s, the Timbers Academy teams and the area&rsquo;s soccer community as a whole,&rdquo; said Gavin Wilkinson, general manager of the Timbers and Thorns FC. &ldquo;This will enable the Timbers and Thorns to continue to be at the forefront of coach and player development, and both teams are very pleased to continue to help promote soccer in the Portland community for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation owns Delta Park, including seven softball fields, one all-weather synthetic sports field with lights, and eight grass sports fields.&nbsp; Due to wet conditions, play cannot take place on the existing eight grass sports fields at Delta Park for approximately six months a year. Synthetic turf fields such as the existing one at the park are open and available year-round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, the citizens of Portland committed to the Parks 2020 Vision for their park system. Part of that vision includes a commitment to improve sports fields, including converting existing grass sports fields to all-weather synthetic turf fields and adding field lights at Delta Park.</p>
<p>Delta Development, LLC, will manage the permitting, design and construction project, subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement with PP&amp;R and Portland Timbers/Portland Thorns FC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new partnership with complement the project approved on May 29th, 2013, by Portland City Council to convert three grass fields to all-weather synthetic turf with lights in partnership with the following youth sports user groups: Portland Youth Soccer Association, Washington Timbers Soccer Club, Northeast United Soccer Club, Portland City United Soccer Club, Southeast Soccer Club and High School Coed Rec Soccer Club.</p>
<p>The Portland Timbers are members of the top professional soccer league in the country, Major League Soccer. They enjoy a rabid following for their extraordinary fans and exceptional play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Thorns FC plays in the National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League (NWSL). They are in their inaugural season and setting league attendance records.</p>

2013,454952,Portland Parks & Recreation Encourages Tree Watering,2,,2013-07-02 16:41:53 UTC,2013-07-02 16:39:00 UTC,A,"Hot, Dry Weather Can Stress Recently Planted Trees","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Hot, Dry Weather Can Stress Recently Planted Trees</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our stretch of hot and dry weather means many of Portland&rsquo;s recently-planted trees may not be getting enough water on their own, according to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s Urban Forestry division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maintaining a mature and healthy tree canopy is one of our City&rsquo;s key livability goals,&rdquo; says Jenn Cairo,Portland&rsquo;s City Forester. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for folks to get out and water their newly planted trees during the dry season. Good watering practices increase the trees&rsquo; chances of survival and helps with vigorous, well-formed root development, so that the trees will be around and beautiful for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Older, more established trees are more hardy and resilient, adds Cairo. But whether your thumb is green or anything but, PP&amp;R Urban Forestry offers these tips:</p>
<p>To keep your newly-planted trees in top shape:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newly-planted trees generally need about 10 to 30 gallons of water each week in dry conditions. Healthy, mature trees generally don&rsquo;t need to be watered. Our climate in Portland generally means that watering in the rainy winter is not necessary, regardless of when the tree was planted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Water for three to six minutes with a hose to produce about 15 to 30 gallons per tree, depending on the flow volume. Watering tubes and 5-gallon buckets with holes in the bottom placed next to the tree trunk are other ways to deliver water to your tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it is possible to overwater a new tree, in a dry Portland summer, it&rsquo;s pretty hard to do. PP&amp;R experts say, &ldquo;When in doubt, water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If water starts to run off the surface, water at a slower rate, water on the other side of the tree, or loosen up any hard surface so water can percolate into the ground. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to dig into the soil and see if the water is penetrating the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watering a tree deeply about once a week is generally better than providing a shallow watering more frequently. Deep watering encourages deeper root growth, which in turn creates stronger trees, better able to withstand windy conditions and future dry seasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can take up to about five years for a newly-planted tree to establish itself in its new environment. Good watering practices during the establishment period are very important to the tree&rsquo;s survival, so keep at it in future summers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When watering, take advantage of the looser, wet soil, and pull up the weeds and grass from around your trees. By reducing the competition for the water, you won't have to water as much. You can also add mulch around the tree. Mulching improves the soil, deters grass and weeds, reduces the need to mow near the tree which can damage the bark and eventually kill the tree, and does a great job of retaining water in the soil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watering your trees and thinking about what the tree will look like in 10 years is all part of the joy of nurturing a tree!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More tree facts to &ldquo;leave&rdquo; you with:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland is green, and is getting greener. New data from a Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s aerial imagery study show thatPortland&rsquo;s urban tree canopy has grown by 2.6 percent over the past 10 years, and now covers nearly 30% of the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lush, greener Portland is a fabulous place to live,&rdquo; said Cairo. &ldquo;Results are positive and encouraging that our canopy growth is moving in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are currently around 240,000 street trees in Portland, and approximately 1.2 million trees in Portland&rsquo;s parks. The City and valued partners such as Friends of Trees are continuing strong efforts to plant more trees. <a href=""http://www.friendsoftrees.org/"">http://www.friendsoftrees.org/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 2009 City of Portland study valued the ecological benefits of Portland's street and park trees at $27 million annually!</p>
<p>Trees soak up rainwater and improve the quality of water. They help to assure the retention and stability of soil, improve air quality, regulate heat in the city, provide wildlife habitat, and make life more pleasant. Trees also increase property values of both residential and commercial property and make communities more livable.</p>

<p>Pools, Splash Pads, Hot Weather Tips from PP&amp;R</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summer is a wonderful time to experience what Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has to offer,&rdquo; says Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz. &ldquo;From our community centers, camps, classes, and the Summer Free for All series of movies and concerts in our parks, there is plenty to choose from! In all activities, stay safe, follow these PP&amp;R guidelines for staying healthy and having fun, and take advantage of the healthy options and resources that Portland Parks and Recreation has to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make 2013 the SAFEST SUMMER YET!!</p>
<p>From Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Stay hydrated! WATER works best, and you should drinkn at least 8 glasses a day (8 oz. each, drink more if you are working, playing or exercising.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Sleep well! Rest is important to the daily recovery of muscles and your body and brain function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Choose food wisely! A sugar rush is usually followed by sugar burnout, about 30 minutes later. Instead, choose whole food proteins, healthy fats and natural sources of carbohydrates. If it wasn&rsquo;t around a thousand years ago or is made by man (and not nature), chances are you don&rsquo;t need it. For more smart food choices, please see <a href=""http://zenhabits.net/beat-the-sugar-habit-3-steps-to-cut-sweets-mostly-out-of-your-life/"">http://zenhabits.net/beat-the-sugar-habit-3-steps-to-cut-sweets-mostly-out-of-your-life/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Don&rsquo;t burn! Remember to pack and USE sunscreen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Cooling centers: people in need of heat relief are encouraged to visit 211info.org or to call 211 for the locations of cooling centers in your area. Other places to get out of the heat include Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Communty Centers, libraries, shopping malls, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Our H20 is NOT too low: The Portland Water Bureau assures us that our City&rsquo;s current water use is normal for this time of year. The Bull Run reservoirs have plenty of water to meet the higher summer demand that comes with hot weather. Anyone with questions can call the Portland Water Bureau Customer Service Center at 503-823-7770.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KEEP COOL IN A PP&amp;R POOL!</p>
<p>PP&amp;R pools offer open play swims, water exercise classes, junior lifeguard training, junior swim training, summer swim teams, and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fields Park, a brand-new 3.2 acre park, opened to the public on May 6, 2013; the grand opening ceremonies were today.&nbsp;The park consists of a one-acre lawn/common area, sitting areas, a strolling path, entry plaza, Portland Loo restroom, and a large children&rsquo;s playground.&nbsp;The park also has an 8,000 square foot dog off-leash area, the 33<sup>rd</sup> in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s system, the first of its kind designed as a dog area from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The views here are amazing,&rdquo; noted Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish, whose office helped supervise the project.&nbsp;&ldquo;The Fields is another example of why Portland is such a wonderful place to live, and what we can accomplish together.&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve transformed this spot from an industrial site to a place for activity and play. I&rsquo;m proud of our city and so thankful to the neighbors and partners who have worked for years to make this park a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grand opening ceremonies began with a Native American blessing of the land by Lois Chillcot, Elder from the Menominee tribe, followed remarks from City and community leaders, and a reading by noted professor Barry Sanders.&nbsp;Students from the nearby Montessori Childpeace School performed a song, and preschoolers from the Portland Public Schools Early Learners Academy at the Ramona presented a banner to commemorate the long-awaited neighborhood park.&nbsp;The park was designed by the Office of Cheryl Barton, landscape architects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love that The Fields has already become a living room for the Pearl District,&rdquo; says Clayton Lloyd, who lives nearby.&nbsp;&ldquo;There's space for everyone to relax and roam. The sweeping view of the Fremont Bridge is uplifting, and helps clear my mind when I go for a lunchtime walk.&nbsp;We've enjoyed seeing the many ways people use The Fields. Recently we saw Frisbee, soccer, and catch being played, along with kite flying, meditation, sunbathing, and&nbsp;picnicking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute; welcomed the parkgoers, and was followed by enthusiastic sentiments from Tiffany Sweitzer of Hoyt Street Properties and PDC Commissioner Aneshka Dickson, and closing remarks from Commissioner Fish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fields Park is incredible,&rdquo; beamed Abbat&eacute;.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the third park in a series of parks throughout this urban renewal area.&nbsp;One can easily forget that the bustling Pearl District was only recently an industrial area in need of some care.&nbsp;We have reclaimed the space for a vibrant neighborhood park for recreation and activity, and it is a tremendous gathering place to connect with the outdoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Six bronze sculptures adorn the southwest and east sides of the park.&nbsp;This amazing public art is the work of artist Christine Bourdette. with support from the Regional Arts and Culture Council (RACC) and Peggy Kendellen.&nbsp;The large and versatile (1 acre) open lawn can be used for informal sports and pick-up games, soaking up the sun, and more. There is plenty of seating on benches and other areas, with a strolling path circling the park.&nbsp;The Fields will be enjoyable for all for years to come.</p>

</ul>
<p>The Fields Park was funded by Portland Development Commission (PDC) tax increment funding and with System Development Charges from PP&amp;R.&nbsp;No General Fund tax dollars were used in constructing The Fields Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total construction cost for The Fields was $3.9 million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>PROJECT BACKGROUND<br /></strong></strong><strong></strong>The Fields is the third&nbsp;park that was outlined in the Portland River District Park System Urban Design Framework Study in January, 2001. The study included planning and design concepts for four parks within the Urban renewal Area (URA) located between NW 10 and 11 Avenues, beginning at NW Johnson. The four parks include Jamison Square (completed 2002), Tanner Springs (completed 2005), The Fields (opened May 6, 2013), and a potential Riverfront Park. The Fields is situated within the Hoyt Street Yards portion of the Pearl District Neighborhood Association (PDNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, the Pearl District was a major industrial and transportation hub of Portland, with extensive rail yards, warehousing, and manufacturing facilities. In the 1950s, many industrial activities were relocated as transportation patterns shifted from water and rail to surface transit on interstate highways and air. The low rents that soon followed created spaces for artists and small businesses.</p>
<p>The Pearl District of today began in the early 1980s with extensive planning efforts to convert warehouses and rail yards into mixed use development. Pearl District redevelopment gained momentum in the 1990s which resulted in urban mixed use with multi-family residential buildings, offices, and a broad range of retail shops and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The City and Hoyt Street Properties enjoy a development agreement that sets the stage for public investments in infrastructure projects such as the Portland Streetcar and parks and private investments in high-density, mixed-use development and affordable housing.</p>

2013,446242,Portland Parks & Recreation Bids Farewell to Longtime Adaptive & Inclusive Recreation Supervisor: Debbie Timmins Leaves a 33 Year Legacy of Service and Dedication to Equality and Access for All,2,,2013-05-06 19:21:14 UTC,2013-05-06 18:44:00 UTC,A,,"<p><img class=""content-left"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=446243"" alt=""Debbie Timmins Retirement Photo"" width=""263"" height=""195"" />Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces the retirement of Adaptive &amp; Inclusive Recreation (AIR) supervisor Debbie Timmins after 33 years on the job.</p>
<p>Timmins began working at what she calls &ldquo;the best job possible&rdquo; in March of 1980, and will be retiring June 1, 2013. Over the course of more than three decades, she has overseen a wide variety of community-based PP&amp;R recreation activities, classes and programs designed for people of all ages (children through adult/seniors) who have physical, mental and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot has changed in 33 years,&rdquo; saysTimmins. &ldquo;I had never even heard of autism when I started in 1980. It was years before the Americans with Disabilities Act, before public transit had lifts and ramps, and there were no types of integrated programs within Portland Parks &amp; Recreation. I&rsquo;m proud to have been a part of helping to foster equality and access for all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Timmins began, PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Adaptive &amp; Inclusive Recreation program was called Specialized Recreation, and only served people who had developmental disabilities. The program was renamed as Disabled Citizens Recreation and finally Adaptive &amp; Inclusive Recreation (AIR), as it stands now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I began working for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, providing inclusion services was a concept that was just starting to be talked about around the nation,&rdquo; addsTimmins. &ldquo;The term used was &lsquo;mainstreaming&rsquo;, then &lsquo;integration&rsquo;. Now PP&amp;R provides people of any age with the opportunity to have an accommodation in any class or activity that they register for; people who have any type of disability and/or special need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute; says Timmins and her 33 years of experience will be missed. &ldquo;On behalf of PP&amp;R and all people who use our programs and facilities, I want to thank Debbie from the bottom of our hearts,&rdquo; says Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a remarkable, determined and selfless woman, a champion of equity who has been instrumental in expanding our vision of including everyone &ndash; regardless of ability &ndash; into the hundreds of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation classes, camps, activities and programs we offer. She is the epitome of the public servant &ndash; a life of dedicated service so that everyone could have great life experiences in our parks, community centers and natural areas.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>SUN Community School Partnership:</h4>
<p>In 2008, PP&amp;R and Multnomah County launched a partnership that provides opportunities for participants in SUN Community Schools to receive the same inclusion assistance as those in the PP&amp;R-facilitated programs.Timmins played a key role in moving this successful collaboration forward. Her expertise has enabled children and teens who need additional support to participate in important academic, enrichment and recreational opportunities. It is one of many examples ofTimmins&rsquo; lasting impact on kids across Portland, and how she&rsquo;s enhanced communities even beyond the PP&amp;R system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Debbie has had unmatched dedication and commitment to providing recreation opportunities to people with disabilities,&rdquo; says Mary Richardson,Timmins&rsquo; direct supervisor. &ldquo;Over the last 33 years, her knowledge and expertise have made her invaluable to PP&amp;R. She will be equally missed by us, and by the community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will miss the wonderful friendships I have had with the program participants, our PP&amp;R staff and volunteers,&rdquo; saysTimmins. &ldquo;And thanks to all the parents who trusted me with their children. I wish everyone the best, and hope you please continue to enjoy what Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has to offer. Go out and have fun!&rdquo;</p>
<h4>AIR Dances, Bowling and Outings:</h4>
<p>A weekly bowling program has been a core activity of the AIR program for more than 20 years. It enables people with disabilities to socialize and take part in healthy activities too often not considered an option for them. The popularity of the program is reflected in the steady participation of 30 regular bowlers.</p>
<p>One of Timmins&rsquo; favorite events is the AIR dance held at&nbsp; Mt.Scott Community Center on the first Friday of each month. More than 200 participants (ages 16+) come from across the Northwest to dance to a DJ or a live band. The dances began in the 1980&rsquo;s, and became so popular over the years that AIR added a social room for mingling to accommodate the large crowds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are really going to miss Debbie,&rdquo; says Melinda Trietsch, an AIR participant. &ldquo;She is helpful and supportive, and she&rsquo;s fun.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>So What&rsquo;s Next?</h4>
<p>&ldquo;What will I do after retirement? I have always had a passion for working with animals,&rdquo; saysTimmins. &ldquo;I wanted to be a veterinarian for a while. I plan to volunteer with animal programs. I look forward to having more time to ride my horse, walk my dog, work out and practice all of the musical instruments that I play. Of course, there are friends to see and plenty of yard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s AIR program offers community-based recreation activities and leisure services specially designed for children, teens, and adults who have a disability and/or special needs. Our services are designed to assist people in developing and using their leisure time in ways that enhance their health, well-being, and independence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mt. Tabor Community Garden is the first garden in the Mt.Tabor neighborhood. The installation of the garden fulfills one aspect of the Mt. Tabor Master Plan, which was updated in 2008. &nbsp;Portland Parks &amp; Recreation worked closely with Mt. Tabor neighbors, the Friends of Portland Community Gardens and other stakeholders in designing the garden to reflect the aesthetic of features found in Mt. Tabor Park, and to create an inviting entrance to this valued regional asset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Portland Community Gardens program has provided gardening opportunities for the physical and social benefit of the people and neighborhoods of Portlandsince 1975.&nbsp;Portland Community Gardens are developed and operated by volunteers and PP&amp;R staff, offering a variety of activities. The Friends of Portland Community Gardens group raised over $13,000 to help fund the construction of the garden. They also provided tools for the garden through a donation from Ames True Temper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly 300 people have signed up to use the 85 plots at the new garden. Gardeners have already organized a group of volunteer site leaders and a group that will work with <em>Produce for People</em>, a program that encourages gardeners to grow and donate produce to local emergency food providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help mitigate the impacts to neighbors, PP&amp;R worked with the Mt. Tabor Neighborhood Association, Office of Neighborhood Involvement Crime Prevention, Friends of Portland Community Gardens, and garden neighbors to craft a Good Neighbor Agreement.&nbsp; This agreement is the first of its kind for a community garden.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Portland Community Gardens</strong></p>
<p>Mt. Tabor Community Garden becomes the 47<sup>th</sup> community garden in Portland. Construction was completed in the fall of 2012.&nbsp; PP&amp;R opened Clarendon Community Garden in March 2012, Frazer Community Garden in April, and Errol Heights Community Garden in May 2012. &nbsp;Ed Benedict, Grant, and Kenton community gardens opened in June. NE 72<sup>nd</sup> Ave. Community Garden opened in October 2012 and the Helensview Community Garden opened in March 2013. Together, these gardens add 450 new plots&nbsp;to the City of Portland&rsquo;s Community Gardens Program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) replanted a Douglas Fir sapling today in PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mt Tabor Park, just in time for Arbor Month. The young tree, thought to be the stolen-and-then-returned sapling from PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park, has a new home on the forested hillside of gorgeous Mt. Tabor. Mt. Tabor Park, at SE 60th and Salmon, encompasses 191 acres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tree, and its replacement in Mill Ends Park ( the world&rsquo;s smallest park), attracted national interest this month. A driver noticed the tree was missing (and, PP&amp;R concluded, stolen) from Mill Ends Park atSW Naito Pkwyand Taylor. After PP&amp;R promptly replaced the tree with another during the first week of March, someone again passing by the park posted a comment online noting that what appeared to be the original tree, roots and all, was lying on its side just outside the park (which has a diameter of two feet). They speculated that perhaps the &ldquo;arborious criminal was feeling remorse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever the motivation, we are relieved,&rdquo; said Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute; at that time. &ldquo;We will be evaluating the tree&rsquo;s condition and if it&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll plant it somewhere in our Gold Medal system as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That time has come, as the healthy young tree is now at its new home, secure in the ground, watered and mulched. PortlandParks&amp; Recreation Stewardship Coordinator Susan Hawes, along with Friends of Mt. Tabor volunteer Darvel Lloyd, planted the tree on Tuesday, March 26, 2013 at 11:30am. PP&amp;R is not disclosing its exact location in order to protect the tiny, vulnerable tree going forward. We figure it&rsquo;s been through enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The planting is timely as Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, along with our valued community partners, gears up to celebrate Arbor Month all throughout April with free family activities, games, celebrations, lectures, nature walks and more across the city. The showcase Arbor Day Festival is on Saturday, April 20 at the Portland Farmer&rsquo;s Market at Portland State University.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More on the Story of the Tree Theft:</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park is part ofPortlandlore. Located atSW Naito Pkwyand Taylor and named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&rsquo;s smallest park, Mill Ends Park is rumored to be the home of a leprechaun family.</p>
<p>The leprechauns were not at home when Portland Parks &amp; Recreation media relations officer Mark Ross took the returned/stolen tree back to PP&amp;R&rsquo;s downtown offices for water and care in early March. However, the leprechauns have been very gracious about the Bureau&rsquo;s rapid attention to the matter, and conveyed their thanks via email. They have declined to grant any interviews.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation park technician Scott Gibson planted a new Douglas Fir sapling on March 6 to replace the missing tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sapling cost the city $3.25, and a donor sent a check to cover that cost. Though it is only two feet in diameter, PP&amp;R waters, weeds and otherwise maintains the tiny Mill Ends Park as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland police cautioned (jokingly) that the tree&rsquo;s return won&rsquo;t mean the end of their pursuit of the thief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remorse does not mean &lsquo;case closed&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Portland Police Bureau Sergeant Pete Simpson after the stolen tree reappeared. &ldquo;We will pursue continue to pursue our investigation and hope that justice is served, and served swiftly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park</p>
<p>Mill Ends Park became a city park in 1976. 30 years earlier, Dick Fagan returned from World War II to resume his journalistic career with the Oregon Journal. His office, on the second floor above Front Street (now Naito Parkway), gave him a view of not only the busy street, but also an unused hole in the median where a light pole was to be placed. When no pole arrived to fill in this hole, weeds took over the space. Fagan decided to take matters into his own hands and to plant flowers. Oregon Journal writer Dick Fagan supposedly captured the leprechaun patriarch, who granted him a wish per leprechaun tradition. Fagan&rsquo;s wish? A park of his own. So the leprechaun granted him the space, where they stood &ndash; the site of Mill Ends Park today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fagan wrote a popular column called Mill Ends (rough, irregular pieces of lumber left over at lumber mills). He used this column to describe the park and the various ""events"" that occurred there. Fagan billed the space as the ""World's Smallest Park."" The park was dedicated on St. Patrick's Day in 1948 since Fagan was a good Irishman. He continued to write about activities in the park until he died in 1969. Many of his columns described the lives of a group of leprechauns, who established the ""only leprechaun colony west of Ireland"" in the park. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O'Toole. After Mill Ends officially became a city park on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 1976, the park continued to be the site of St. Patrick's Day festivities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, contributions have been made to the park, such as the small swimming pool and diving board for butterflies, many statues, a miniature Ferris wheel (which was brought in by a normal-sized crane), and the occasional flying saucer. The events held here include concerts by Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court.</p>
<p>The park had to be moved temporarily in 2006 due to construction onNaito Parkway. It was replaced on March 16, 2007 in true St. Patrick's Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and the Fagan family, including Dick's wife Katherine, in attendance.</p>

<p>Project to Restore Salmon Runs, Plant Hundreds of Native Trees and Plants, Enhance Recreation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work will begin in summer 2013 to restore Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Westmoreland Park&rsquo;s wetland area and Crystal Springs Creek. Thousands of plantings, including 389 native trees, are planned for the park. &nbsp;Additionally, boardwalks and overlooks, seating, paths, lighting, and picnic areas will be included as detailed in the 2004 Westmoreland Park Master Plan.</p>
<p>The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, TriMet, and Metro are partners in the Westmoreland Park/Crystal Springs Restoration Project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of the Westmoreland Park/Crystal Springs Restoration Project is to restore Crystal Springs Creek, and support recovery of endangered salmon and trout species. The restoration includes planting wetland habitat for native waterfowl, amphibians and mammals, and reinstalling recreational facilities. The partners will restore the stream channel in the park, plant native vegetation, and improve the trailhead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Restoring ecosystems and improving watershed health is an important facet of the Corps mission,&rdquo; said Col. John Eisenhauer, commander of the Corps of Engineers&rsquo; Portland District. &ldquo;Most of our past restoration efforts have been in rural or suburban settings, so it is exciting to have this opportunity to bring salmon back into the city, in a way that is good for the fish and the neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project is an important part of our work to ensure that native salmon will always return to this important urban stream,&rdquo; says Environmental Services Director Dean Mariott. &ldquo;Enhancing fish habitat is key to the recovery of threatened salmon and trout, and this project improves their chances of recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project will restore salmon runs, allowing access for fish for the first time since the 1970s. When work is complete, salmon will once again pass through the cool, clear waters of Crystal Springs Creek, which flows through Westmoreland Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be seeing rejuvenated spawning routes and new habitat for thousands of fish,&rdquo; notes Portland Mayor Charlie Hales. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to embrace this terrific partnership and realize these efforts to get the wetlands back to what nature intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The project will remove theWestmorelandParkduck pond, a source of heat and sediment. In place of the duck pond, a wetland, planted with native trees and shrubs, will shade and cool the creek and improve wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourteen trees are being removed for the project. Nine of the trees to be removed are non-native. Many of the trees to be removed are in failing health; these trees were not planted in an appropriate environment. In their place will be 389 trees (specifically chosen to thrive in this location) and nearly 15,000 plantings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled we will be able to create access for salmon once again in this part of the city, while preserving well over a hundred existing trees,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We will do everything we can to preserve today&rsquo;s urban canopy while planting hundreds of new trees that will expand it even further as they grow. This is an exciting chance to improve both valued natural habitat and recreation opportunities for kids and adults alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Crystal Springs Creek</p>
<p>The creek is a tributary to Johnson Creek, and home to fish, river otter, heron, eagles and frogs. Its naturally cool water and steady, year-round flow provide ideal fish habitat. Endangered salmon and trout, including Coho, Chinook and steelhead, migrate through Westmoreland Park to the ocean and back to spawn.</p>
<p>There are nine culverts on Crystal Springs Creek between SE 28th Avenue and the creek&rsquo;s confluence with Johnson Creek. Culvert replacement or removal is a key element of recovery for endangered juvenile salmon and trout species. BES is working with local and federal agencies, as well as partners, to replace all nine culverts by 2015. To date, five of the culverts have been removed or replaced, and for the first time since the early 1970s, winter salmon are returning to the headwaters of Crystal Springs Creek in Reed College Canyon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is Salmon-Safe!</p>
<p>PP&amp;R is the only parks district in the entire nation to be certified as Salmon-Safe. (http://www.salmonsafe.org/blog/portlandparks)</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;stewardship of the wild fish is accomplished through an integrated approach to watershed and natural resource issues.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation plays an important role in maintaining the city&rsquo;s green infrastructure. Our region&rsquo;s unique geography means that fish spawning in the pristine creeks of the Cascades must first swim through downtown Portland.</p>
<p>By accepting the Salmon-Safe recertification, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation continues its commitment to be mindful of water quality and watershed connections in all of its operations, on all 200-plus park sites. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will continue efforts to maintain and continually improve system-wide salmon-friendly practices, and endeavor to set an example for the City of Portland, the Northwest, and park agencies nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Westmoreland Park Nature-Based Play Area</p>
<p>In coordination with this project, PP&amp;R will be constructing the City of Portland&rsquo;s first permanent nature play area in Westmoreland Park. When work is complete, the play area will reflect the environmental values embodied by the creek restoration. Children and adults will experience and enjoy nature in the city. The park will also receive new recreational amenities, including a relocated basketball court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Park Impacts</p>
<p>Westmoreland Park will be closed west of the primary path from SE Bybee to Lambert streets. One bridge, located near the maintenance building, will remain open during the restoration (beginning summer 2013), allowing access from the east side of the park to SE 22nd Ave. All other bridges will be closed. The east side of the park (tennis courts, lawn bowling, restrooms, ball fields, casting pond, parking lot and new basketball court to be built south of the casting pond) will be open and accessible via McLoughlin Blvd., SE Bybee and SE Nehalem St. Expect to see construction equipment throughout the summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Funding</p>
<p>The restoration of Crystal Springs Creek inWestmorelandParkwill cost approximately $2 million. TriMet construction mitigation from the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Transit Project will contribute $200,000. The remaining costs will be shared between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Environmental Services, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and Metro, through Metro Local Share Bond 2006.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE EVANS SCHOLARSHIP:<br /></strong>Awarded by the Western Golf Association Evans Scholarship Foundation (WGAESF). According to the Evans Scholarship website:&nbsp;<br /><a title=""http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021363/k.2457/Who_We_Are.htm"" href=""http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021363/k.2457/Who_We_Are.htm"">http://www.wgaesf.org/site/c.dwJTKiO0JgI8G/b.6021363/k.2457/Who_We_Are.htm</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the award provides full housing and tuition scholarships to deserving caddies across the country. Currently, more than 850 caddies are attending college on scholarship; there are more than 9,000 Evans Alumni across the country. Most Scholars attend one of the 14 universities where the Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.<br />The Evans Program is funded by contributions from more than 100,000 golfers across the country, as well as Evans Alumni and proceeds from the BMW Championship.&rdquo;<br /><br />Portland Public Golf Manager John Zoller is a proud member of the 9,000+ Evans Scholarship alumni. <br /><br />Zoller says that famed golfer Charles &ldquo;Chick&rdquo; Evans, Jr. grew up in the Chicago area in the early 1900s. Evans earned money by caddying at the local country club.&nbsp;Wanting to go to college, he found that he could not afford it nor was there anyone to help him.&nbsp;<br /><br />In the early 1920s, Evans won both the US Amateur and the US Open golf tournaments, and with the victories came considerable wealth and notoriety. Determined to help others in his former situation, he started the Evans Foundation. It is currently the largest privately funded scholarship program in the world, with more than 9,000 alumni.&nbsp;<br /><br />The requirements for an Evans Scholar are based on financial need, good citizenship, being in the top 10% of one&rsquo;s high school class, and two years either caddying or working in the golf business.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>PP&amp;R PUBLIC GOLF:</strong></p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation cares for 1.2 million trees in PP&amp;R parks and natural areas, and oversees an additional 240,000 street trees across the city!&nbsp; The amount of Portland&rsquo;s land covered by trees, known as the urban canopy, has increased by nearly 3% during the past nine years. &nbsp;The success is due to efforts undertaken by successful public-private partnerships including the Tree Stewardship Coalition, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, Friends of Trees and the Bureau of Environmental Services. Currently, 30% of Portland&rsquo;s surface area is covered in urban forest, with a goal of 33% per the <a title=""http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/60402"" href=""/parks/60402"">Urban Forest Management Plan</a>, completed in 2004.</p>

2013,439355,Stolen Tree Returned to World’s Smallest Park,2,,2013-03-08 23:28:45 UTC,2013-03-08 23:25:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Seeks to Replant Douglas Fir; Bring Thief to Justice</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is pleased to announce that a Douglas Fir sapling, thought to be the missing tree stolen last week from PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park, has been returned.</p>
<p>On Friday, March 8, a driver passing by the park posted a comment online noting the tree, roots and all, was lying on its side just outside the park, which has a diameter of two feet. They speculated that perhaps the &ldquo;arborious criminal was feeling remorse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever the motivation, we are relieved,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;We will be evaluating the tree&rsquo;s condition and if it&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll plant it somewhere in our Gold Medal system as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Abbat&eacute; speculated that Forest Park might be a possible destination for the young sapling, which made national news this week after news spread of its apparent theft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park is part ofPortlandlore. Located at SW Naito Pkwy and Taylor and named by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&rsquo;s smallest park, Mill Ends is rumored to be the home of a leprechaun family.</p>
<p>The leprechauns were not at home when Portland Parks &amp; Recreation media relations officer Mark Ross took the tree back to</p>
<p>PP&amp;R&rsquo;s downtown offices for water and care. However, the leprechauns have been very gracious about the Bureau&rsquo;s rapid attention to the matter, and conveyed their thanks via email. They have declined to grant any interviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation park technician Scott Gibson planted a new Douglas Fir sapling this past Wednesday to replace the missing tree. The sapling cost the city $3.25. Though it is only two feet in diameter, PP&amp;R waters, weeds and otherwise maintains the park as needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are delighted the leprechauns have their shade back,&rdquo; adds Director Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;This park has an amazing, truly &ldquo;Portland&rdquo; history, and is just as important as any other in our system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland police caution that the tree&rsquo;s return won&rsquo;t mean the end of their pursuit of the thief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remorse does not mean &lsquo;case closed&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Portland Police Bureau Sergeant Pete Simpson. &ldquo;We will pursue continue to pursue our investigation and hope that justice is served, and served swiftly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Mill Ends Park</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mill Ends Park became a city park in 1976. 30 years earlier, Dick Fagan returned from World War II to resume his journalistic career with the Oregon Journal. His office, on the second floor above Front Street (now Naito Parkway), gave him a view of not only the busy street, but also an unused hole in the median where a light pole was to be placed. When no pole arrived to fill in this hole, weeds took over the space. Fagan decided to take matters into his own hands and to plant flowers. Oregon Journal writer Dick Fagan supposedly captured the leprechaun patriarch, who granted him a wish per leprechaun tradition. Fagan&rsquo;s wish? A park of his own. So the leprechaun granted him the space, where they stood &ndash; the site of Mill Ends Park today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fagan wrote a popular column called Mill Ends (rough, irregular pieces of lumber left over at lumber mills). He used this column to describe the park and the various ""events"" that occurred there. Fagan billed the space as the ""World's Smallest Park."" The park was dedicated on St. Patrick's Day in 1948 since Fagan was a good Irishman. He continued to write about activities in the park until he died in 1969. Many of his columns described the lives of a group of leprechauns, who established the ""only leprechaun colony west of Ireland"" in the park. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O'Toole. After Mill Ends officially became a city park on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in 1976, the park continued to be the site of St. Patrick's Day festivities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, contributions have been made to the park, such as the small swimming pool and diving board for butterflies, many statues, a miniature Ferris wheel (which was brought in by a normal-sized crane), and the occasional flying saucer. The events held here include concerts by Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The park had to be moved temporarily in 2006 due to construction onNaito Parkway. It was replaced on March 16, 2007 in true St. Patrick's Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and the Fagan family, including Dick's wife Katherine, in attendance.</p>

2013,438862,Portland’s Innovative Fountain Series Captured in National Register of Historic Places,2,,2013-03-06 23:43:52 UTC,2013-03-06 23:37:00 UTC,A,Portland Parks & Recreation Featured in National Register of Historic Places,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation properties honored</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland, OR -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The innovative series of downtown Portland fountain plazas by world-renowned landscape architect Lawrence Halprin has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places, according to the Oregon State Historic Preservation Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Known individually as Keller Fountain, Pettygrove Park, Lovejoy Fountain, and the Source Fountain, the public plazas are located between SW Clay and Lincoln streets and First and Fourth Avenues and are connected by a system of pedestrian walkways. They are collectively called the &ldquo;Portland Open Space Sequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Portland is well-known for the 1970s and 1980s transformation of its downtown with great public spaces like Waterfront Park and Pioneer Courthouse Square,&rdquo; said Randy Gragg, president of the Halprin Landscape Conservancy, the initiators of the nomination. &ldquo;But it was Halprin&rsquo;s fountain plazas of the 1960s that first made downtown safe for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A winner of the Presidential Medal of the Arts and other honors, Halprin and members of his firm, Lawrence Halprin and Associates, designed the plazas from 1963-1970 as the heart of the city&rsquo;s first urban renewal district, known as the South Auditorium District. Their unprecedented sculptural wedding of public space, water, and references to the natural landscape turned the plazas into instant people magnets, luring investment and laying the groundwork forPortland&rsquo;s unique urban renewal policies for decades to come, according to the nomination&rsquo;s proponents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly forty-three years after the late architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable declared that it &lsquo;may be one of the most important urban spaces since the Renaissance&rsquo;, this defining achievement in Halprin's extraordinary career has been deservedly recognized by inclusion in the National Register,&rdquo; said Charles A. Birnbaum, president and founder of The Cultural Landscape Foundation in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halprin&rsquo;s ideas about nature, movement and social interaction transformed the American urban landscape and influenced a generation of designers. Halprin designed important urban projects such as the Century 21 World&rsquo;s Fair site in Seattle;Sproul Plaza at the University of California-Berkeley; Ghirardelli Square and Embarcadero Plaza in San Francisco; Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis; Heritage Park Plaza in Fort Worth,Texas;&nbsp;the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial inWashington,D.C.; and the Walter and Elise Haas Promenade in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As these plazas approach 50 years of age, the Halprin Landscape Conservancy, nearby property owners and the City of Portland have initiated a public-private stewardship program that has already resulted in tree-thinning, new lighting, and repairs to the iconic shelter designed by Halprin associate Charles Moore at Lovejoy Fountain. This spring, the conservancy will launch a plan for additional restoration and ongoing enhanced maintenance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Register is maintained by the National Park Service under the authority of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. More information about the National Register and recent Oregon listings is online at www.oregonheritage.org (click on &ldquo;National Register&rdquo; at left of page).</p>

<p><em><strong>Part of Black History Month Celebration</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) will honor longtime Peninsula Wrestling Club coach and North Portland icon Roy Pittman this Wednesday, February 27, from 5:30-7:30pm at Peninsula Park Community Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us as we celebrate the Peninsula Park Wrestling program and honor the legendary coach Pittman as part of our Black History Month celebration.</p>
<p>WHAT: A tribute to longtime Peninsula Wrestling coach Roy Pittman</p>
<p>WHEN: Wednesday, February 27, 2013 from 5:30pm-7:30pm.</p>
<p>WHERE: Peninsula Park Community Center, 700 N. Rosa Parks Way, east gym.</p>
<p>NOTES: PP&amp;R will honor Coach Roy Pittman&rsquo;s decades of efforts on behalf ofPortland&rsquo;s youth. Meet Coach and the wrestlers of Peninsula Wrestling Club, enjoy refreshments, and learn more about the legendary program&rsquo;s history and ways to become involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focused more on the process of growth and risk-taking than on winning, Pittman has worked with over 60,000 young men and women. Many of them have won state, regional and national titles. Peninsula Wrestling Club alumna and Milwaukie High School graduate Kelsey Campbell took part in the 2012 London Olympics women&rsquo;s freestyle wrestling competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coach Roy Pittman, high school state champion, collegiate wrestling champion, Olympian, coach, mentor, motivator, inspirational speaker and dedicated community advocate, worked for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation for more than 30 years. In 1970 he founded the Peninsula Wrestling Club, and helped place Portland and PP&amp;R on the national radar. Coach Pittman retired in 2000, but stayed active with the Peninsula Wrestling Club, continuing nearly half a century of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is fitting that he will be honored this week as part of the Peninsula Centennial Celebration &amp; Black History Month.</p>
<p>Coach Pittman continues to rent out space from Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to run the wrestling program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach is an inspiration to all with his tireless dedication to youth and their families,&rdquo; says Debbie Harris, PP&amp;R recreation coordinator. &ldquo;He has served Portland for five decades through his unwavering inspiration to the sport of wrestling; he reaches out to all, and has made his spectacular wrestling program a nationally recognized model of excellence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coach Pittman is lauded for his unwavering dedication to help youths overcome any financial, transportation or other challenges and make sure that anyone who is interested can participate in his programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The East Gym at Peninsula Park Community Center was dedicated and named for Coach Pittman in August of 2007.</p>
<p>Pittman has held wrestling practices for youth a tPeninsula Park Community Center five days a week year around. His wrestlers compete in out-of-state tournaments, and he holds an annual wrestling summer camp.</p>

<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) and Friends of Peninsula Park Rose Garden (FPPRG) will welcome volunteers to help with planting nearly 3,200 new, hardy, disease-resistant roses in Portland&rsquo;s oldest public rose garden at Peninsula Park.</p>
<p>The planting will enhance the garden ahead of the centennial celebration this June. PP&amp;R staff will lead the rose planting, which will take place from Tuesday, February 19 through Friday, February 22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The project for the hardy new roses a tPeninsula is a terrific example of partnership,&rdquo; beams Ann Gardner, president of the newly formed FPRG and OSU Master Gardener. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the result of collaboration between Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and its marvelous staff, Master Gardeners, the Friends of Peninsula Park Rose Garden, many valued city businesses, volunteers, and the Portland Parks Foundation. We are grateful for all their help and hope we can serve as a model of the success of such public-private partnerships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R appreciates the willingness of so many neighborhood, business, community, and Master Gardener volunteers who have committed to work on this project. &nbsp;Valued volunteers for the project consist of private citizens, employees at Wells Fargo, Standard Insurance, OSU Extension Services Master Gardeners, the Leach Botanical Garden, and the Royal Rosarians. However, donations are needed to complete the project at the city&rsquo;s historic rose garden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT: Volunteers and PP&amp;R staff planting nearly 3,200 new roses at Peninsula Park Rose Garden</p>
<p>WHEN: Tuesday, February 19 through Friday, February 22 beginning at 9am through 2pm.</p>
<p>WHERE: Peninsula Park Rose Garden, N. Albina &amp; N. Ainsworth St.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oregon State University (OSU) Master Gardeners are partners in the planting project. Weeks Roses, Star Roses and Baileys Nursery have all donated roses to plant at Peninsula Park Rose Garden - a retail value of approximately $100,000. Wilbur Ellis donated 4.5 tons of lime, a nearly $2,000 value - all of which has been applied to the beds.</p>
<p>The varieties of roses being planted are designed not just to be durable, but sweetly fragrant and remarkably gorgeous.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the newly formed Friends of Peninsula Park Rose Garden are working to raise about $15,000 to install a thick mulch layer as we plant the nearly 3,200 new roses in the park. The mulch will hold moisture and provide a barrier against pests such as the rose midge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations are welcome! You can send a check to the Portland Parks Foundation</p>
<p>111 SW Oak Street, Suite 400</p>

2013,432388,Portland Parks & Recreation and City of Portland Celebrate Completion of E205 Initiative Projects:,2,,2013-01-30 21:05:55 UTC,2013-01-30 20:57:00 UTC,A,Enhancing Park Service East of I-205,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland, OR) -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) announces the completion of E205 Initiative to enhance and improve parks in East Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Championed by Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish, the E205 Initiative improves existing PP&amp;R parks and facilities in the area east of Interstate 205, which does not yet have the rich tradition of parks and recreational places seen elsewhere in the Rose City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E205 is a series of projects at 12 East Portland parks and included adding new amenities that make an immediate impact, such as new playgrounds, park benches, new soft-surface trails, fenced dog off-leash areas, new and refurbished playground equipment, and adding new water fountains. PP&amp;R and its partners also invested in special projects such as a bicycle pump track at Ventura Park and a new community garden at Ed Benedict Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The E205 Initiative is a tremendous first step in meeting our commitments to East Portland,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;By maximizing the impact of the limited money available, we&rsquo;ve quickly improved the quality of parks in East Portland. We are seeing a big impact through E205&rsquo;s relatively small changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commissioner Fish says the City made a promise to East Portland, and kept that promise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One in five Portland families doesn&rsquo;t have ready access to a park or natural area,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The City proudly made the E205 Initiative a priority. And now the E205 projects have given East Portland more safe places for kids, and affordable community anchors for neighborhoods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valued partners, including the Portland Parks Foundation, helped raise funds for the E205 Initiative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A healthy community needs parks and every child deserves a place to play,&rdquo; adds Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the Portland Parks Foundation. &ldquo;It was gratifying to raise funds and awareness for this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Special thanks to:</p>
<p>City Council and Commissioners</p>
<p>The Portland Parks Foundation</p>
<p>Safeway</p>
<p>East Portland Residents and Neighborhood Advocates</p>
<p>The Portland Development Commission</p>
<p>East Multnomah Soil &amp; Water District</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Staff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E205 Initiative improvements, alphabetically by park:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Argay Park - NE 141st Ave &amp; Failing St</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation installed a new drinking fountain near the dog off-leash area, as well as three new park benches for two-legged visitors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cherry Park, SE 110th Ave &amp; Stephens St</p>
<p>PP&amp;R installed a soft-surface path and two new park benches at Cherry Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Portland Community Center &amp; Pool - 740 SE 106th Ave</p>
<p>PP&amp;R built a new playground at the popular community center, featuring play equipment for children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old.</p>
<p>East Portland Community Center has the most visitors of any PP&amp;R community centers city-wide. New, super cool play structures are in place with names like the Mountaineer!</p>
<p>Park goers will fine a six-seat swing, synchro-spinners, a climbing wall and spring toys which are fully fenced in for safety. Many portions of the new play equipment were constructed with environmentally-responsible recycled materials such as milk jugs and scrap steel. Play features are designed with physical and social development in mind, and comply with all safety and accessibility standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Holladay Park - 12999 NE Holladay St</p>
<p>PP&amp;R built a sparkling new, soft-surface playground at the neighborhood park. It features play equipment for children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old. Features include a giant ladybug climbing shell, slide, a six-seat swing and infant swings, climbing structures, and a jungle gym. Elements bring to mind a rainbow, or perhaps the dramatic beauty of a peacock tail, with plenty of space to run and play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ed Benedict Park &ndash; SE 100th Ave &amp; Powell</p>
<p>PP&amp;R installed the new, 40-plot Ed Benedict Community Garden (SE 104th and Bush), plus a new drinking fountain near the skate park plaza. The Ed Benedict Community Garden helped Portland Parks &amp; Recreation realize the 1,000 Gardens Initiative of a thousand new community garden plots by 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glenfair Park - NE 154th Ave &amp; Davis St</p>
<p>PP&amp;R crews installed a soft surface trail and two new park benches, plus picnic tables with concrete pads. Through the E205 Initiative, park-goers can now enjoy a picnic while watching sports activities on the adjacent ballfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gilbert Primary Park, SE 134th Ave &amp; Foster Rd</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation workers installed trail distance markers to keep track of your physical activity on a new, &frac12; mile soft surface trail. Park-goers can now also enjoy bright new park signs, benches, reconstructed fences, and a resurfaced playground. The adjacent elementary school and the larger community both benefit from the new amenities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lynchwood Park &ndash; SE 170th Ave &amp; Haig St</p>
<p>The park was once without a formal pathway system, along with other park amenities. Through the E205 Initiative,LynchwoodParknow has soft surface walking and jogging paths to help provide access and visibility into the park (addressing some neighborhood-identified concerns). A fenced dog off-leash area, bright new signage, new park benches and a drinking fountain are also in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Midland Park &ndash; SE 122nd &amp; Morrison</p>
<p>Midland Park will have both additional and improved lighting on its west side. Park benches will be replaced and installed closer to brightly-lit areas.</p>
<p>The park will enjoy additional plants that are known to attract birds and butterflies. The fencing will be cleaned and shored up, and a new gate installed that can be secured by volunteers only when the park is closed.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R crews plan to have this final E205 Initiative project completed this spring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parklane Park &ndash; SE 155th &amp; Main</p>
<p>A neighborhood summer picnic and celebration, complete with a PP&amp;R Summer Free for All Movie in the Park, marked the improvements to Parklane Park. Amenities include both new and refurbished picnic tables and benches, two new drinking fountains, a new playground, concrete pathway, and refurbished playground equipment in response to community and neighborhood input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ventura Park &ndash;SE 115th &amp; Stark</p>
<p>PP&amp;R, in partnership with the NW Trail Alliance, has installed a pair of circular off-road bicycle tracks known as pump tracks. Gravel pathways, kiosk signage, and additional plantings and landscaping are also in place as part of this unique, community-driven project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>West Powellhurst Park &ndash; SE 115th &amp; Division</p>
<p>Four new park benches now grace West Powellhurst Park, along with an improved surface to the walking/jogging path that makes the trail ADA-accessible. The path is designed for use in all ofPortland&rsquo;s seasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the E205 Initiative</p>
<p>The City of Portland has an unwavering commitment to areas east of I-205. 75% of Portlanders enjoy access to a park or natural area within a fifteen-minute walk of their home. Many of the parks provide a variety of amenities from sports fields and playgrounds to pathways and picnic areas. When looking at the park system east of I-205, we see a different picture.</p>
<p>Incorporated later into the City of Portland, East Portland does not have the rich tradition of parks and recreational places. Yet, East Portland has experienced population growth and now 40% of families with children are living in this area. Demand for equitable recreational services is high. New parks can cost in the tens of millions and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is looking toward a bond measure in the future to address these service gaps.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the E205 Initiative has improved and added to the amenities in existing parks. Smaller, affordable basic improvements can make a big difference to a community. Designed to make minor improvements (under $250,000 per site) such as a community gardens, trails or playgrounds, E205 leveraged City dollars with private dollars to complete projects inEast Portland as an ongoing commitment to the area. The City Council unanimously allocated $500,000 towards immediate improvements for existingEast Portland parks; the Portland Parks Foundation worked with private individuals, businesses, and foundations to add to the City's dedicated funding. Project cost or total allocation per park is $250,000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Park and Project Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>Park has identified service delivery gap</p>
<p>Park has identified community support</p>
<p>Project has broad appeal to a wide range of community members</p>
<p>Project leverages other funding, partnerships, or in-kind materials and services</p>
<p>Project with no significant site preparation or permitting issues that can be built or under construction within 18 months</p>
<p>Project cost or total allocation per park is $250,000.</p>

2013,428963,93-Year-Old Woman Maintains Independence with Portland Parks & Recreation Personal Trainer,2,,2013-01-08 19:33:29 UTC,2013-01-08 19:30:00 UTC,A,"An inspiring story, and more proof that you're never too old to be active!","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willa Asbjornsen told her daughter she didn&rsquo;t need to be in an assisted-living community. The 88 year-old wanted to move back home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Allison Asbjornsen was concerned about her aging mother&rsquo;s ability to care for herself. The two women agreed to a compromise: Willa could move back home &ndash; if she worked out with a personal trainer to improve her strength and balance to ensure she was fit enough to care for herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Five years later, the now 93-year-old Willa is still living at home and thriving, thanks in part to Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) personal trainer Holly Howard, based at Southwest Community Center. The pair is a shining example of how PP&amp;R can help enhance the quality of life for people of all ages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willa is remarkable. I like to say that everyone falls in awe with her!&rdquo; says Howard. &ldquo;Willa has gotten more confident and has a great attitude. At first I think she felt like she HAD to be there with me. Now she eagerly embraces our sessions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willa and Holly work on exercises essential for doing everyday tasks; reaching, standing, sitting, and more. The 93-year-old client says she&rsquo;s delighted she can confidently sit, stand, and reach, and can improve her wellness without even the use of weights or machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holly is very inventive about finding exercises I can do. At the same time she urges me on through exercises I initially balk at,&rdquo; says Willa. &ldquo;And soon I find I can do them! I live in an area that&rsquo;s very hilly, and I find that now it&rsquo;s easier to climb the hills than it was before. Bending over is easier than it used to be. She keeps finding new exercises so it doesn&rsquo;t get boring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holly incorporates a weighted medicine ball in Willa&rsquo;s workouts, along with modified push-ups, pull-ups, dumbbells, and other functional balance and strength exercises. Her goal is to make the sessions fun for the 93-year-old, as well as to produce results that enable Willa to maintain her strength, mobility, and flexibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of things I&rsquo;ve learned from Holly I can do at home too, and I really like that,&rdquo; says Willa. &ldquo;She takes care to spot me during exercises. When I was growing up, women were never encouraged to be athletic. But even without an athletic background I&rsquo;ve been able to do all this &ndash; even at my age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willa and her trainer, Holly, have maintained their life-enhancing partnership for five years and counting. They work together two to three times a week, and Willa exercises solo as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very conscious of her body image, even at 93,&rdquo; remarks Holly. She gets her hair done regularly, and wants to have a skinnier stomach! Willa is an inspiration, maintaining her current quality of living while being ready for whatever life brings her tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation has personal training, group exercise classes, fitness centers and pools available at community centers across the city. For more info please go to <a href=""http://www.portlandparks.org"">www.portlandparks.org</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Willa Asbjornsen</p>
<p>Willa was born in Portland in 1919 and is a member of McMinnville High School&rsquo;s class of 1937. She earned a degree from Oregon State University in 1941 and then (in her forties) went on to earn her masters in physiology from the University of Portland.</p>
<p>Earning this degree allowed her to teach a training class for social workers at Mt. Hood Community College.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once Willa retired from teaching in her sixties, she began to backpack around the world, staying in hostels with only a single duffle bag.</p>
<p>While on her travels she visited Africa, Southeast Asia, India, and Turkey. During this time she ventured into the Himalayas, reaching a peak elevation of 16,000 feet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Holly Howard</p>
<p>Holly is a Personal Trainer, Group Exercise Instructor, and Gym Supervisor at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;sSouthwestCommunity Center. She is a lifelong Portlander, married to her high-school sweetheart Justin. They are &ldquo;parents&rdquo; to a rescued dog, Oreo, and two cats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holly says she weighed close to 220 pounds in high school, but decided to make a change in her life at the end of her junior year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I opened my eyes to a world of eating that didn&rsquo;t involve processed foods, fast foods, or soda pop,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I began thinking about where my nutrition was coming from, prompting me to eat more fruits, veggies, and lean meats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While continuing to eat healthy, Holly rediscovered the gym with a good friend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved the feeling I got after I accomplished a challenging routine,&rdquo; she remembers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holly pursued a degree atPortlandCommunity Collegeand began interning at Southwest Community Center (SWCC). The enamored staff then offered Holly her current position at SWCC, which she has enjoyed for five years.</p>
<p>Holly teaches five days a week and says she is always open to taking on new clients.</p>

<p>PP&amp;R Lifeguards Exceed Standards in Hidden Camera Aquatic Safety Audit</p>
<p>The lifeguards had no idea they were under surveillance. Nor did they realize they were about to be put to the test in an emergency rescue simulation. It didn't matter. They were ready. And that's the point. The lifeguards are always ready at Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s swim pools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R Aquatics announced in the summer of 2012 that PP&amp;R guards received a rating of &ldquo;Exceeds Standards&rdquo; during a recent unannounced hidden camera audit performed by international aquatic safety expert Jeff Ellis &amp; Associates, Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're really proud of our lifeguards, but not surprised by the results,&rdquo; said Nancy Roth, PP&amp;R Aquatic Program Supervisor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We demand excellence from our staff every day. These external audits of our operation are at the core of our commitment to safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lifeguards at Portland&rsquo;s 13 public swim pools undergo multiple unannounced audits during the course of the summer. The audits are a mandatory component of Ellis &amp; Associate's Comprehensive Aquatic Risk Management Program (CARMP). In order to evaluate each lifeguard's professional diligence, the audits include undercover video surveillance of individual lifeguards while they protect their Zone of Protection&reg; area. Once the video surveillance is completed, an Ellis &amp; Associates auditor tests the basic life support and rescue skills of the staff through simulated emergencies intended to measure the effectiveness of a facility's emergency action plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The audit concludes with administrative, supervisory, and facility evaluations. &ldquo;Earning this rating is a remarkable accomplishment,&rdquo; said Richard A. Carroll, Ellis &amp; Associates Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. &ldquo;These lifeguards are on the top of their game. The guests at PP&amp;R facilities are getting the highest degree of swimmer protection available in the aquatic industry.&rdquo;</p>

2012,425792,"Metro, City of Portland Protect Columbia Slough Wetland as New Natural Area",2,,2012-12-13 20:46:39 UTC,2012-12-13 20:41:00 UTC,A,Broadmoor Property offers 54 New Protected Acres for Wildlife,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Metro and the City of Portland teamed up this week to protect 54 acres of wildlife habitat near the Columbia Slough in Northeast Portland. The Broadmoor natural area acquisition is a partnership among Metro, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R). PP&amp;R will manage the site as a natural area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nestled next to Broadmoor Golf Course, the new natural area features sensitive wetland habitat and wildlife that depends on it. More than 170 species of birds including kingfishers, owls and great blue herons use the area, in addition to deer, bats and amphibians. A trails plan for the Columbia Slough calls for a future pathway to wind along the new property, bringing walkers, runners and cyclists up close with nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This wetland area along the Columbia Slough is a rare remnant of Columbia River floodplain,&rdquo; said Portland Environmental Services Director Dean Marriott. &ldquo;Preserving it will protect a significant natural resource and help improve water quality in the slough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The $530,400 purchase price was split three ways among Metro&rsquo;s voter-approved 2006 natural areas bond measure, Portland&rsquo;s local allocation from that bond measure and Environmental Services&rsquo; Grey to Green initiative. This new natural area, managed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, is located east of Northeast 33rd Drive, near Portland International Airport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can protect even more valuable wetlands &ndash; preserving them for wildlife, and providing another place for people to appreciate nature in Portland,&rdquo; said Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Mike Abbat&eacute;. &ldquo;Being good stewards of this region for the next generation is at the core of who we are as Portland Parks &amp; Recreation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voters across the region approved a $227 million bond measure in 2006 to protect water quality, wildlife habitat and opportunities to enjoy nature. Metro buys land in 27 areas, selected for their high-quality habitat and ability to make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Columbia Slough is one of the most expansive focal points of the bond measure, with wetlands and slow-moving channels stretching 19 miles from Fairview Lake on the east to Kelley Point Park in North Portland on the west. It&rsquo;s also one of the most urban areas, dotted with warehouses, neighborhoods and major thoroughfares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sets it apart is that you are surrounded by urbanized areas,&rdquo; said Metro Councilor Rex Burkholder, who has represented this part of the region for 12 years. &ldquo;Yet there you are, and you&rsquo;ve got eagles and herons and otters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The once-degraded slough is returning to health bit by bit, with a concerted effort by nonprofit groups, public agencies and residents. Metro and the City have collaborated to purchase four new natural areas in the slough watershed, including the latest addition. Metro also has secured rights to build nearly three miles of the Marine Drive and Columbia Slough trail networks, where significant gaps currently force visitors onto the street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will slowly recover over time, because we&rsquo;re going to help clean it up,&rdquo; said Burkholder, who will be recognized by the Columbia Slough Watershed Council in February for his leadership. &ldquo;Giving access to people to something right in their back yards is so amazingly special.&rdquo;</p>

2012,421955,PP&R’s Rose City Golf Course Clubhouse Listed on National Register of Historic Places,2,,2012-11-26 07:03:34 UTC,2012-11-19 19:07:00 UTC,A,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Building Dates from 1932</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Rose City Golf Course clubhouse,2200 NE 71st Ave., has been officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built in 1932, the clubhouse at Rose City is a beautiful, brick building with steep pitched roofs. Inside, golfers are welcomed in the Hank Childs pro shop. They can spend time before or after a round in the Rose City Grill where breakfast, lunch and snacks are available every day.</p>
<p>The National Register of Historic Places is the official federal list of properties that are significant in American history, architecture, archaeology, and engineering. &ldquo;Listing in the National Register is intended to provide recognition of a property&rsquo;s significance as well as its preservation,&rdquo; writes Roger Roper, Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There not many places in golf that have the character and charm as the Rose City club house,&rdquo; beams Rose City golf pro Hank Childs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was built in an era where golf was more than just a recreational game, where people came together socially to talk golf and enjoy the camaraderie of the game. It's a wonderful part of the game that now is rare to find, but still exists today at RC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The outside of the historic clubhouse has not changed much since its original construction; however the inside has gone through numerous changes. The building now features an impressive rock fireplace and large finished beams with a fir tongue and grove ceiling. The clubhouse was opened in 1932, designed by architect Herbert A Angell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose City Golf Course hopes to use the national historical listing as a way to acquire funds for an eventual restoration of the clubhouse. Staffers are hopeful that a restored clubhouse on the National Register of Historic Places would be natural draw for more business, drawing more private tournament and events, and making the restaurant a neighborhood gathering place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But most importantly, a renovation would even further enhance the charm and character of our historic facility, and encourage the vibrant social life to the neighborhood,&rdquo; adds Childs. &ldquo;With our new national historic designation, a restored clubhouse would be something that the PP&amp;R and the City ofPortlandcould long be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Rose City Golf Course</p>

<p><em>Two More E205 Initiative Projects Enhance East Portland</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Portland,OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is pleased to announce the City&rsquo;s latest E205 Initiative successes.</p>
<p>Two new outdoor playgrounds at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s East Portland Community Center and East Holladay Park are now completed and open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction began in early August. The playgrounds were designed by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation landscape architect Travis Ruybal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new playgrounds at East Portland Community Center and East Holladay Park reflect our commitment to the clear civic justice of providing better parks to the traditionally underserved areas east of I-205,&rdquo; says City Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;Seeing happy children use these new playgrounds is another example of how the City&rsquo;s E205 Initiative brings East Portlanders together by making neighborhood parks more welcoming places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Portland Community Center served the most people of any Portland Parks &amp; Recreation community center last year, tallying 375,000 visits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playground at PP&amp;R&rsquo;s East Holladay Park (12999 NE Holladay) has turned the park into a neighborhood destination. Amenities include two new play structures swings, a slide, see-saws, and other play equipment on top of a bark surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Portland Community Center &amp; Pool - 740 SE 106th Ave</p>
<p>The PP&amp;R playground features play equipment for children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old. See the attached photos for some of the snazzy play structures that rise from the soft bark surfacing! Supercool structures with names like the Synchro Spinner and Mountaineer mean the playground is sure to delight! Many portions of the new play equipment are constructed with environmentally responsible recycled materials such as milk jugs and scrap steel. Play features are designed with physical and social development in mind, and comply with all safety and accessibility standards. They include slides, swings, a jungle gym, climbing structures, and more!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>East Holladay Park- 12999 NE Holladay</p>
<p>The East Holladay Park playground features play equipment for children ranging in age from 2 to 12 years old. See the attached photos for some of the snazzy play structures on top of the soft surface! Features include a giant ladybug climbing shell, slide, in-line and infant swings, climbing structures, and a jungle gym. Elements will bring to mind a rainbow, or perhaps the dramatic beauty of a peacock tail, with plenty of space to run and play! Special thanks to PP&amp;R staff for their work on these endeavors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the E205 Initiative</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E-205 Initiative was enacted by the City by a 5-0 Council vote.<br />There have been many projects in East Portland undertaken under the umbrella of E-205 initiative. The idea is to make smaller, affordable improvements in existing parks and facilities which can make a big, immediate and tangible difference to a community without waiting for a bond measure (which could take years).</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staffers are working on amenities such as new park benches, painting and refurbishing play structures and refurbishing and/or installing new play equipment and water fountains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E-205 Initiative came about under the guidance of City Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. New parks can cost in the tens of millions and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is looking toward a bond measure in the future to address these service gaps. Fortunately, PP&amp;R is able to make noticeable, tangible, and useable improvements at this time and going forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many Portlanders love our city for its beautiful parks, but few people recognize how many citizens don&rsquo;t have access to them,&rdquo; says Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the Portland Parks Foundation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is especially true inEast Portland, where the population has been rising for decades with very few parks being created. We see the projects of E-205 as both extremely necessary and also having a remarkable return on investment. Nowhere can so little money have a greater impact than with E-205. As the fundraising foundation forPortland&rsquo;s park-loving citizens, equity of access is central to our mission. We are an eager partner to make these outstanding opportunities become reality.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em><strong>January 23, 2019 public information session on the Barbara Walker Footbridge over West&nbsp;Burnside</strong></em></p>
<p>The long-awaited safety solution to one of the region&rsquo;s most perilous road crossings&mdash;the <a href=""https://www.portlandpf.org/footbridge-over-burnside"">Barbara Walker&nbsp;Footbridge Over Burnside</a> connecting Forest Park&rsquo;s Wildwood Trail&mdash;will begin construction in February. On&nbsp;January 23, the Portland Parks Foundation will host an important information session on the bridge: it&rsquo;s&nbsp;design and engineering, and the impacts construction will have on users of the Wildwood Trail and West&nbsp;Burnside.</p>
<p><strong>Public Meeting Details</strong><br />Wednesday, January 23, 2019, 6:30 pm - 8:30 pm<br />Oregon Zoo, Conservation Hall (located in the Education Center)<br />4001 SW Canyon Road*</p>
<p><em>*To avoid traffic congestion, consider taking Tri-Met&rsquo;s MAX light rail (Red or Blue Line) or Tri-Met Bus Line&nbsp;63 to the Washington Park MAX Station.</em></p>
<p>Developed by the Portland Parks Foundation in a private/public partnership with the City of Portland and&nbsp;Metro, the $3.15-million bridge will connect the Wildwood Trail over West Burnside. It will allow the 80,000&nbsp;hikers and runners who use the trail each year to safely pass over the 18,000 drivers who use West&nbsp;Burnside every day while adding an architecturally stunning new feature to Forest Park&rsquo;s landscape.</p>
<p>The two-phase construction will begin in February and be completed by late summer. If you use the&nbsp;Wildwood Trail or West Burnside&mdash;or just want to learn more about the bridge&mdash;please join us. The Wildwood Trail stretches over 30 miles from Washington Park to the farthest, northwestern end of&nbsp;Forest Park. Trail users have lobbied for decades for a safe crossing of ever-busier West Burnside. In 2014&nbsp;the Portland Parks Foundation took on the project, advocating for the high-quality work of design the setting&nbsp;deserves.</p>
<p>Designed by nationally renowned, Portland-based artist Ed Carpenter and to be named for the late urban&nbsp;parks and trails advocate Barbara Walker, the bridge quickly became one of the region&rsquo;s greatest grassroots&nbsp;private public partnerships. PPF raised $2.1 million from nearly 1,000 donors across metropolitan Portland.&nbsp;The City of Portland directed $500,000 from Portland&rsquo;s general fund and $350,000 in transportation Systems&nbsp;Development Charge funds from the Portland Bureau of Transportation (PBOT). Metro allocated $200,000&nbsp;from its Open Space Bond Measure. Parks commissioner Nick Fish, past parks commissioner Amanda&nbsp;Fritz, and transportation commissioner Chloe Eudaly, along with their staff and their respective bureaus, have provided critical support. Including R&amp;H Construction, kpff, Inc., Walker Macy, and Shiels Obletz&nbsp;Johnsen,&nbsp;PPF&rsquo;s design/construction team has also contributed thousands of dollars in pro bono services.</p>
<p>The Portland Parks Foundation&rsquo;s public meeting will be an opportunity to learn more about the bridge&rsquo;s&nbsp;design, engineering, and construction along with the trail and arterial lane closures necessary for its&nbsp;completion. As we move into the construction phase, PPF&rsquo;s contractor will be doing all it can to minimize&nbsp;inconvenience to drivers and trail users while we complete this critical piece of public safety infrastructure&mdash;and work of public art.</p>

<p>Some repairs, including lighting, concrete work, and painting, are weather-dependent. Any work extending past April 1 will not affect the reopening date or public access to the Eastbank Esplanade.</p>
<p><strong>Closure ahead? Use Better Naito instead!</strong></p>
<p>PBOT and PP&amp;R are pleased to announce that <a href=""http://www.betternaito.com/"">Better Naito</a> will open on January 28, 2019 to provide a safe detour during the Eastbank Esplanade maintenance project. Better Naito provides the closest continuous connection between the Hawthorne and Steel bridges on the west side of the Willamette River.</p>
<p>This is the third year of the Council-approved, 5-year implementation of Better Naito. Like past years, PBOT will install plastic posts to separate one northbound motor vehicle lane on Naito Parkway between SW Main Street and NW Couch Street. There will also be a designated passenger drop off zone on SW Taylor Street to better accommodate people being dropped off by personal vehicles, taxis, and rideshares.</p>
<p>PP&amp;R has placed signage noticing the upcoming closure on and near the affected portion of the Esplanade. The City will continue public involvement notifications and updates on the Eastbank Esplanade maintenance project throughout the closure. Thank you to all neighbors and visitors for their patience while we repair this well-used Portland pathway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better Naito is once again proving its worth, this time&nbsp;as a safe and convenient alternate route for the thousands of people who walk and bike along the Eastbank Esplanade every day,&rdquo; said Transportation Commissioner Chloe Eudaly. &ldquo;It is also an important first step in the implementation of&nbsp;projects within the Central City in Motion Plan approved by City Council in November. Community members have requested&nbsp;quick implementation of the projects within the plan, and we are listening. I look forward to more progress in 2019, 2020 and beyond.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Background: Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade Maintenance Project</strong></p>
<p>The Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade is one of Portland&rsquo;s iconic sites and pathways, both a beloved City park and a major bicycle and pedestrian thoroughfare running approximately 1.5 miles along the east bank of the Willamette River from the Hawthorne Bridge to the Steel Bridge. The City&rsquo;s 2018-19 Adopted Budget includes $500,000 in one-time General Fund resources, plus $200,000 in ongoing funding for maintenance, to begin addressing the issues on the Esplanade and making safety and functional improvements.</p>
<p>According to PBOT, during summer months the Eastbank Esplanade sees approximately 2,400 daily bicycle trips (almost 500 during the two-hour peak) and approximately 1,200 daily walking trips. The SW Naito Corridor (including the Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park path) is one of Portland&rsquo;s busiest bikeway corridors. In the summer of 2018 it attracted approximately 5,200 daily bicycle trips.</p>
<p>The Esplanade was named after Mayor Vera Katz in November 2004 to honor her vision and leadership for Portland - which included support for the construction of the esplanade.&nbsp; Along with the iconic bronze statue of Mayor Katz located just north of the Hawthorne Bridge, five other significant works of public art populate the Esplanade as it makes its way to the Burnside Bridge.</p>

<h2><strong>About the Evans Scholarship</strong></h2>
<p>Famed golfer Charles ""Chick"" Evans, Jr. grew up in the Chicago area in the early 1900s. Evans earned money by caddying at the local country club. Wanting to go to college, he found that he could not afford it, nor was there anyone to help him. In 1916, Evans won both the US Amateur and the US Open golf tournaments, and with the victories came considerable wealth and fame. Determined to help others in his former situation, he started the Evans Scholars Foundation. It is currently one of the country&rsquo;s largest, privately funded scholarship programs.</p>
<p>Supported by the Western Golf Association, the Chick Evans Caddie Scholarship&nbsp;provides full housing and tuition to deserving caddies across the country. Currently,&nbsp;965 caddies are attending college on scholarship; there are more than 10,600 Evans Alumni worldwide. Most Evans Scholars attend one of the 14 universities where the Foundation owns and operates a Scholarship House.</p>
<p>The Evans Scholars Program is funded by contributions from more than 32,000 supporters nationwide, as well as Evans Scholars Alumni and proceeds from the BMW Championship. Recently-retired Portland Parks Golf Manager John Zoller (who spent nearly four decades leading the program) is a proud Evans Scholar Alum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The requirements for an Evans Scholar are based on financial need, good citizenship and being a top student and caddie.</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R)&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/61025"">Peninsula Pool</a> will reopen Monday, July 8, 2019 for the Summer 2019 season. The <a href=""http://www.parksreplacementbond.org/"">Parks Replacement Bond</a> and Parks <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a>* funded major renovations at the popular outdoor pool, located at 700 N. Rosa Parks Way in Portland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=736273"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p><em><strong>The renovations at Peninsula Pool have increased the pool&rsquo;s capacity from 188 to a maximum of 296 swimmers.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Peninsula Pool is a neighborhood treasure,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;The upgrades will allow more users to enjoy the pool this summer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peninsula Pool and all other PP&amp;R outdoor pools are open through August 25, 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project added a wall between the pool&rsquo;s deep and newly expanded shallow water areas. The larger shallow water portion increases the pool&rsquo;s capacity for swim lessons and for free play by younger and less experienced swimmers. The project also added a lift to the adjacent Peninsula Community Center, providing Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) access to the lower-level classroom and dance studio spaces.</p>
<p>Other project improvements included new pool and deck lights, new drainage and water circulation systems, new pumps, a high-efficiency filtration system, and gutters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peninsula Pool has a rich history of serving a multicultural community,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;And now the expanded pool is a place where even more neighbors, families, and friends can gather and make lasting summer memories. Thanks to all our project team members, partners, and to our staff for making this vision a reality.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""Body"">&ldquo;The Halprin Sequence is a unique series of public plazas and fountains,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;This restoration means they will be enjoyed for generations to come. Thanks to all the project partners, especially the Halprin Landscape Conservancy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Body"">First conceived in the 1960s, the Portland Open Space Sequence is comprised of Keller Fountain, Pettygrove Park, Lovejoy Fountain and The Source Fountain. The fountains, pathways and plazas are located along tree-lined pedestrian malls between SW 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Avenues and between SW Lincoln and Clay Streets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been more than 50 years since the first park was christened,&rdquo; said Bob Naito, board president, Halprin Landscape Conservancy (HLC). &ldquo;This restoration project has been our focus for several years and we&rsquo;re grateful for the enthusiastic support of the south downtown business community, neighborhood residents, and property owners. We&rsquo;re honored to help refresh and reinvigorate these parks for a new generation to enjoy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renovation began in July 2018 and addressed aesthetics, accessibility, safety, security, and maintenance issues. Work included improvements to wall and concrete structures, joint sealing, paving, underground utilities, stormwater drainage systems, walkway and fountain lighting, electrical service modifications, and ground features. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Urban Forestry replanted trees as part of their normal purview.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Body"">&ldquo;The Portland Open Space Sequence is a jewel of our City,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;And thanks to the efforts of the Halprin Landscape Conservancy and the dedication of City Council, the parks are restored for the benefit of all. We appreciate all the funding, dedication, and hard work.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Restoration refurbished key City parks</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Open Space Sequence was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in March 2013. In December 2016, the City of Portland worked with the Conservancy to generate local support and create a <a href=""/transportation/article/622537"">voluntary local improvement district</a> to restore the historic fountains and plazas. $2.15 million was provided by the LID and $1.7 million by the City of Portland for the Portland Open Space Sequence Restoration Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Body"">The Halprin Landscape Conservancy (HLC), a nonprofit founded to activate, maintain and restore the Portland Open Space Sequence, mobilized the effort and work began to restore the Sequence in July 2018. Funding of the campaign came from an innovative voluntary local improvement district (LID), in which property owners in the surrounding area agreed to assess themselves to pay for repairs that qualify under State of Oregon regulations. The LID was approved and finalized by Portland City Council in December 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Body"">The HLC is a volunteer nonprofit organization dedicated to preserve, maintain and activate the Portland Open Space Sequence.&nbsp;As stewards, they partner with neighbors, businesses, community organizations and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to ensure the Sequence is clean, safe, and active for today and future generations.

<p>&ldquo;Leach Botanical Garden is East Portland&rsquo;s hidden gem &ndash; for now.

Thanks to our partners and the many public and private donors who have contributed to this project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Leach Garden Friends partnered on the Leach Botanical Garden master plan, the culmination of five years of planning and design. Construction will begin on Monday, August 4, 2019, and is expected to be complete in summer 2020.</p>
<p>The Leach Garden Friends raised over $1.26 million in private donations to contribute toward the project. Other funding included $6.5 million in Parks System Development Charges (fees developers pay on new construction), $2 million from Prosper Portland, and a $188,000 grant from Metro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leach is so unique,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Adena Long. &ldquo;And with such robust private fundraising leveraging City and partner funding, we are seeing grass-roots support helping to create a world-class botanical treasure. It will be an urban sanctuary, a place for reflection, science, and recreation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pharmacist John Leach and botanist Lilla Leach donated their prized garden to the City in their will. In 1981, then-Parks Commissioner Charles Jordan saved the property from being sold. The Manor House and gardens were preserved for, and continue to serve, all Portlanders and visitors. Now Leach is moving forward to its next chapter, creating and expanding spectacular opportunities to connect with nature for education, culture, gatherings, and recreation.</p>
<p>The enhancements at Leach Botanical Garden build on recent and ongoing efforts by Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to construct parks in historically under-served east Portland.</p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>About Charles Jordan and Charles Jordan Community Center</strong></p>
<p>In June 2012, Portland City Council voted unanimously on a measure put forth by Commissioner Nick Fish to rename Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s University Park Community Center in honor of Charles Jordan. The Charles Jordan Community Center was rededicated on Sunday, July 22, 2012 with a free public celebration, which Jordan attended.<strong></strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;There never has, and there never will be, someone more deserving of this honor,&rdquo; said Commissioner Fish at the time. &ldquo;He was the person who took Portland Parks &amp; Recreation to the next level. Charles Jordan is a champion for the environment and conservation nationwide. His commitment to children, families, and to building community is extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His great saying was &lsquo;Parks are more than just fun and games,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Michelle Harper, who worked with Jordan for years in several capacities. &ldquo;He was a spiritual person with a strong connection to his church, and he saw us all as being connected. Portland&rsquo;s parks were where we could come together to build community and family.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Notable Charles Jordan quotes</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t understand, they won&rsquo;t value; what they don&rsquo;t value, they won&rsquo;t protect; and what they don&rsquo;t protect, they will lose.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em></em><em>&ldquo;Today you follow, but tomorrow you will be expected to lead.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em></em><em>&ldquo;If change is to be, it&rsquo;s up to you and me.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Dreams are simply goals with wings.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Model the way &ndash; you never know who is watching and wanting to be just like you.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>What: </strong>Portland&rsquo;s <a href=""/parks/arbor"">Arbor Day 2019</a> tree planting celebration<br /><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, October 12, 2019, 10am-12pm, rain or shine<br /><strong>Where:</strong> East Holladay Park, 12999 NE Holladay Street, Portland, Oregon 97230 (accessible via #20 and #77 TriMet buses as well as car, bike or foot)<br /><strong>Who: </strong>Everyone! We welcome all ages and abilities, no previous planting experience required.&nbsp;Urban Forestry staff will lead attendees through the process of properly planting trees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Arbor Day 2019 website: <a href=""/parks/arbor"">portlandoregon.gov/parks/arbor</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbor Day has been observed nationally for almost 150 years. Portland will be marking its 42<sup>nd</sup> consecutive year as a <a href=""https://www.arborday.org/programs/treecityusa/"">Tree City USA</a> by the National Arbor Day Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees provide countless benefits to people and the environment. I am deeply committed to expanding our urban tree canopy, especially in East Portland,&rdquo; says Portland City Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m proud that both my bureaus, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation and the Bureau of Environmental Services, are leaders for trees and the environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R Urban Forestry is expanding the urban tree canopy in areas of need of trees. In Portland, existing canopy coverage is not equitably distributed throughout the city. Excluding Forest Park, Portland&rsquo;s canopy cover west of the Willamette River is 44%. However, east of the Willamette River, where 80% of Portland&rsquo;s residents live, canopy cover is only 21%. Many low-canopy neighborhoods are neighborhoods with the highest percentage of communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Planting and maintaining trees reduces the effects of climate change by removing carbon dioxide and other particulate matter from the air, reducing regional air temperatures. The larger the tree, the greater the environmental benefits.<span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Trees are part of the very fabric of Portland,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;We are delighted to have Arbor Day and the tree planting events to remind us of how lucky we are to live among so many trees, and to benefit from all they offer. Our thanks to the hardworking staff in our Urban Forestry division.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.portlandpf.org/"">Portland Parks Foundation</a> and <a href=""http://www.portlandparks.org/"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation</a> are pleased to announce that they have received a $200k Neighborhood Builders grant from Bank of America. The two-year grant ($100,000 each year) will significantly expand free summertime lunch and recreation activities in east Portland, the region of the city most in need of those services.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=746503"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p><em>Portland Parks Foundation and Portland Parks &amp; Recreation staff, including PP&amp;R Director Adena Long (center) accepted the grant with Parks Commissioner Nick Fish (checkered shirt). The Bank of America grant will allow the Bureau's Mobile Lunch + Play program to expand significantly.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BofA grant will greatly expand Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s (PP&amp;R) Summer Free For All Mobile Lunch + Play program. In partnership with <a href=""https://www.mowp.org/"">Meals on Wheels People</a>, Mobile Lunch + Play brings free summertime lunch, sports, arts, crafts, and games to apartment complexes and sites in Portland where parks are currently scarce. Meals on Wheels People was the recipient of the Neighborhood Builders grant last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to Bank of America, thousands more Portland children will receive a free, healthy meal,&rdquo; says Portland Parks Commissioner Nick Fish. &ldquo;The Neighborhood Builders grant strengthens our longstanding partnership with Bank of America. Thanks to our philanthropic partner &ndash; the Portland Parks Foundation, and to Roger Hinshaw and Monique Barton at Bank of America for their commitment to Portland families.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognize the critical role that local nonprofits play to build pathways to economic progress in the Portland community. Through Neighborhood Builders, we connect nonprofits like Financial Beginnings Oregon and the Portland Parks Foundation to the funding and leadership development resources they need to further scale their impact,&rdquo; said Roger Hinshaw, Bank of America&rsquo;s Market President in Oregon and Southwest Washington. &ldquo;Both of these nonprofits do extraordinary work, so I am pleased we are able to bring forward this additional support at a particularly strategic time for them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly forty percent of east Portland households still lack a park within a half mile of their homes. Density continues to grow in east Portland with an estimated 25,000 more housing units coming by 2035. Bank of America&rsquo;s support will allow PP&amp;R and PPF to expand the Mobile Lunch + Play program to reach more kids and families in need, and bring fun and games to areas without easy park access.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=746506"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p><em>A Mobile Lunch + Play event brings smiles to kids at an east Portland apartment complex. The Portland Parks &amp; Recreation program brings free lunches and the summertime park experience - games, sports, arts and crafts - to areas which don't yet have ready access to parks.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bank of America Neighborhood Builders grant will allow us to bring a lot of the fun of a park directly to the kids,&rdquo; says Randy Gragg, PPF&rsquo;s Executive Director. &ldquo;With our city growing so quickly, Mobile Play + Lunch is a fast, effective way to better serve more of our city&rsquo;s kids.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are so thankful to Bank of America,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;The grant helps our Free Lunch + Play program grow in size and scope; to deliver the summertime experience every Portland child deserves.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>About Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Native American Community Advisory Council (NACAC)</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, in collaboration with Native communities and local tribes, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) co-created the Native American Community Advisory Council <a href=""/parks/63749"">(NACAC</a>), with the understanding that the Willamette Valley and Columbia River indigenous people hold a unique status as the original stewards of this region&rsquo;s land. PP&amp;R is a large land manager in Portland and is committed to the stewardship of public properties and the community interactions with parks and natural areas. This stewardship creates a unique relationship between the Native community and PP&amp;R. In recognition of this shared interest, and the essential value of working with the Native community, a unique council of interested Native community members advise&nbsp;PP&amp;R about Native cultures, lifeways, and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Native American Community Advisory Council is comprised of local federally recognized tribal members and Native American urban organization members on staff with the City of Portland. &nbsp;The group provides a forum to discuss values such as sacredness of land, the importance of spiritual and cultural connection to heritage, and&nbsp;the recognition that Indigenous peoples have been here since time immemorial. Native people continue to contribute immeasurably to our nation, state, tribes, and City.&nbsp;</p>

Nick called his 11 years of service on the Portland City Council <em>'the great honor of my life.'</em> He fought abdominal cancer for more than two years.""<br /><br /></p>

2020,751503,PP&R opens new Bond-funded bridge on Springwater Corridor,2,,2020-02-13 20:15:46 UTC,2020-01-14 17:50:00 UTC,A,"New bridge at SE 45th Avenue opens Wednesday, January 15, 2020","<p><strong>POSTED JANUARY 14, 2020</strong></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to funding from the <a href=""https://t.e2ma.net/click/egkzsc/u8kryp/ij9nco"">Parks Replacement Bond</a>, a new bridge installed along the Springwater Corridor near SE 45th Avenue will open on Wednesday, January 15, 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=751520"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>The new bridge is located near the Johnson Creek Boulevard trailhead at SE 45th Avenue and Johnson Creek Boulevard. It replaced the original wooden trestle bridge&nbsp;from the Springwater Division Line rail, dating from the 1900s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parks Replacement Bond funding allowed for durable steel and concrete construction. The bridge allows for clear passage over Johnson Creek, which will improve fish habitat and reduce debris accumulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please use caution in the area, as there will still be some construction activity near the trail while contractors complete the landscaping installation.&nbsp;Thank you for your patience during this project!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>41 of 52 <a href=""/parks/43290"">Bond projects</a> are now complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bond also funded the replacement of the wooden decking on the Springwater Corridor bridge near SE Circle Avenue - and the complete replacement of three bridges in Forest Park and two bridges in Marshall Park. All of the new bridges have been designed to be durable and easy to maintain so that trail users can enjoy these spaces for decades to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click <a href=""/parks/74599"">here</a> for more information on the Bond-funded bridge projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Parks Replacement Bond has not only benefited our parks system; but also the local economy and businesses. To date, 41% of the value of all Bond-funded construction work has been awarded to Disadvantaged, Minority, Women, and Emerging Small Businesses (also known as D/M/W/ESB).&nbsp;</p>

2020,752729,North Park Blocks Extension Funded: parking lot to transform into green space,2,,2020-02-04 20:50:10 UTC,2020-01-30 18:03:00 UTC,A,,"<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><strong>POSTED JANUARY 30, 2020</strong><br /></span></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is allocating $8 million in funding from <a href=""/parks/38516"">System Development Charges</a> towards extending the <a href=""/parks/finder/index.cfm?action=ViewPark&amp;PropertyID=447"">North Park Blocks</a>. Located between NW Glisan and Hoyt and NW 8<sup>th</sup> and Park Avenues, the project will transform a City-owned parking lot next to the Pacific NW College of Art into a new public green space. The endeavor also aligns with the larger <a href=""https://www.broadwaycorridorpdx.com/"">Broadway Corridor</a> project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extending the North Park Blocks will add valuable green space to the Central City and give Portlanders additional access to the housing, offices, shops, and transportation routes which the Broadway Corridor project will offer,&rdquo; says Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. &ldquo;Parks are an integral part of this new neighborhood that is adding thousands of new households and offices.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When complete, the northernmost North Park Block will transition straight to another new park on the redeveloped post office site. It will also help improved connections between the Pearl District and Old Town/Chinatown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newest North Park Block will provide an important place for neighbors and visitors to relax, to play, and to reflect,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;We appreciate the partnership the City enjoys with key stakeholders, including area businesses and the highly-regarded Pacific Northwest College of Art, as this project continues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Development Charges (SDCs) are one-time fees assessed on new development to cover a portion of the cost of providing specific types of public infrastructure required as a result of this development. Park SDCs help ensure that Portland's quality of life keeps pace with our growing and changing city by providing additional parks and recreation facilities needed to accommodate growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Broadway Corridor</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.broadwaycorridorpdx.com/"">Broadway Corridor</a> is an urban development project which will positively change Portland&rsquo;s downtown landscape and catalyze significant investments. It&rsquo;s envisioned to be a unique, diverse, vibrant, sustainable, mixed-use, dense urban district seamlessly integrated with a regional multi-modal transportation hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Broadway Corridor encompasses the former U.S. Postal Service site, and is a key opportunity site for high-density employment, mixed-income housing, and signature city attractions and amenities. The project will connect the Old Town/Chinatown and Pearl District neighborhoods, with the goal to maximize community benefits, particularly to those groups that haven&rsquo;t benefited from other urban projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, via the <a href=""/parks/69257"">Parks for New Portlanders</a> program, also hosts events such as the Portland World Cup Soccer Tournament and WALK with Refugees and Immigrants.

<p>&ldquo;This event means a great deal to us,&rdquo; says Amin Khananzai, President of Afghan Youth Association of Portland. &ldquo;The Portlanders Stand with Refugees &amp; Immigrants celebration gives people who are new to Portland from around the world a chance to showcase our culture and community.

2020,753875,PP&R announces the new Glenhaven Park Community Garden,2,,2020-02-14 22:15:11 UTC,2020-02-14 22:13:00 UTC,A,"Grand opening celebration on Saturday, February 29, 2020","<p><span style=""font-size: 14.52px;""><strong>POSTED FEBRUARY 14, 2020</strong></span><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is pleased to announce the opening of the newest <a href=""/parks/39846"">Portland Community Garden</a> at Glenhaven Park. The Glenhaven Community Garden is the latest of 57 Portland Community Garden citywide. The site provides 32 garden plots for people to grow healthy, organic food for themselves and their families.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=753874"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>The Glenhaven Community Garden was developed through a partnership with <a href=""https://www.growportland.org/"">Grow Portland</a>, with <a href=""https://emswcd.org/"">East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation District</a> providing $15,000 for the project. Portland Community Gardens are fenced areas with individual garden plots ranging in size from 10 by 10 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet. Gardeners have access to water and onsite storage for tools and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The grand opening celebration on Saturday, February 29, from 10am&ndash;11:30am is free and open to all. The Glenhaven Community Garden is located on the west end of Glenhaven Park (7900 NE Siskiyou Street) near the tennis courts. The event will include light refreshments and family-friendly activities, including face painting and planting flowers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Glenhaven Community Garden replaces one formerly at Madison High School which closed in 2018 when the school expanded. Contractors working with <a href=""https://www.pps.net/"">Portland Public Schools</a> on the Madison High School renovation salvaged the shed, raised beds, and informational kiosk from the Madison Community Garden and stored them during garden construction so they could be reused in the new garden.&nbsp;</p>

2020,754028,Portland Parks & Recreation’s commitment to sustainability continues,2,,2020-02-19 20:51:03 UTC,2020-02-19 19:06:00 UTC,A,Energy and water efficiencies implemented at nine park sites,"<p><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><strong>POSTED FEBRUARY 19, 2020</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has begun new energy and water efficiency upgrades at nine city parks and community centers, including North Portland&rsquo;s Delta Park and five parks east of I-205. PP&amp;R is installing new LED lighting to pathways and building interiors and exteriors, improving the output of irrigation systems and their control systems, and retrofitting water fixtures along with other enhancements. Specific sites and improvements are listed below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=754027"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p><em>PP&amp;R crews survey equipment at PP&amp;R's Matt Dishman Community Center. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation continues to make effective and tangible steps toward even greater energy conservation and more efficient, lower-maintenance infrastructure.</em></p>
<p>In addition to advancing the City&rsquo;s and PP&amp;R&rsquo;s shared environmental goals, these improvements will save Parks $45,000 per year in utility costs and reduce the maintenance liability by over $100,000 annually. Project planning continues, and physical improvements are expected to begin this Spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are proud to have begun this important work to save energy and to benefit our environment,&rdquo; says Portland Parks &amp; Recreation Director Adena Long. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the realization of a goal we outlined in our Strategic Plan, and is a team effort. We expect to enjoy lower utility costs than they would otherwise be, need less recurring maintenance, and to serve as a model for other City bureaus as they consider similar efforts in conservation and efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>City Council unanimously authorized PP&amp;R to take this win-win approach in March of 2017, under the leadership of Commissioner Nick Fish. This pilot project builds on PP&amp;R&rsquo;s legacy of energy, environmental, and equity goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specific benefits anticipated in the project include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower utility costs and less overall maintenance</li>
<li>Higher-efficiency systems with greater reliability</li>
<li>Bird-safe exterior lighting fixtures that reduce light pollution</li>
<li>Water-saving upgrades for irrigation systems and splash pads&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>While the initial phase of the project involves upgrading nine locations in the PP&amp;R system (listed below), eventually PP&amp;R would like to scale this kind of investment to the more than 140 locations where such work is feasible. Such a step would help make significant progress supporting PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Financial Sustainability goals and on the Mayor&rsquo;s priorities around combatting climate change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This pilot sustainability project supports the larger vision and would not have happened without the innovative efforts of our dedicated PP&amp;R staff, supporting procurement team, and the energy services industry,&rdquo; adds PP&amp;R Director Long. I applaud our creative, committed staff and their ongoing work to ensure a greener future for Portlanders, of both current and future generations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PP&amp;R thanks all the bureau staff involved, plus the <a href=""/bps/"">Bureau of Planning &amp; Sustainability</a>, Procurement, Attorney&rsquo;s Office and all other City partners for their contributions in planning the effort.&nbsp;</p>

2020,756259,Mayor Wheeler Announces Plans to Keep Columbia Pool in North Portland Open Through June 2021,2,,2020-04-16 22:35:49 UTC,2020-03-06 21:37:00 UTC,A,Mayor Ted Wheeler announced he will include funding for Columbia Pool in his proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year.,"<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler today announced that he will include funding for Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/parks/60927"" target=""_blank"">Columbia Pool</a>&nbsp;(7701 North Chautauqua Boulevard in Columbia Park) in his proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Columbia Pool is treasured by the North Portland community for swim lessons, water fitness, and as a neighborhood gathering place,&rdquo; said Mayor Wheeler. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pleased that we&rsquo;re able to keep the pool open for another year and I appreciate the passion of the community, the work of Portland Parks &amp; Recreation, and the partnership of my Council colleagues.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=756260"" alt="""" width=""100%"" /></p>
<p>While Columbia Pool receives about 60,000 visits a year, significant funding challenges remain. The building needs a new roof and heating system and other major capital repairs that could cost up to $5 million to fix. The pool will cost about $800,000 to operate this year while generating about $310,000 in revenue, so an additional $490,000 is needed to keep the doors open through June 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is preparing feasibility studies about repairing or replacing Columbia Pool in North Portland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Council is committed to putting Portland Parks &amp; Recreation on solid financial footing,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler adds. &ldquo;While work to secure new revenue continues, I&rsquo;m glad that this pool will keep serving swimmers year-round in North Portland.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years, expenses have outpaced revenues, resulting in a backlog of deferred maintenance and closures citywide. The Parks Bureau has spent over a year working to realign and adjust operations to create a more sustainable funding model for the future of our parks system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Portland, OR) &ndash;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">At the direction of Oregon Governor Kate Brown, City parks, trails, golf courses, and natural areas remain open to the public.&nbsp;All visitors must work together to meet at least 6 feet of physical distancing from people that do not live in their home.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">Achieving 6 feet of physical distancing is extremely challenging at playgrounds, skate parks, and sports courts and fields, and those facilities have been closed to the public since March 23. They remain closed at this time under the advice of public health officials.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) has monitored the COVID-19 situation since it began. PP&amp;R continue to be in communication with and to follow the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Oregon Health Authority, Multnomah County Health Department, and the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">For park, trail, golf course, and natural area visitors, follow these guidelines:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>People who are exhibiting symptoms of any illness should stay home and refrain from using any PP&amp;R facility.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Follow CDC guidelines and wash your hands before and after you visit a park, trail, or natural area, or any other public space.</li>
<li>Follow CDC physical distancing recommendations and keep at least 6 feet from others at all times, including interacting with other park visitors and PP&amp;R staff. If you can&rsquo;t maintain that distance, find another location or come back another time.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Be prepared for limited access to public restrooms and no operating water fountains.</li>
<li>While on trails, announce your presence to others and step aside to let others pass.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li><a href=""https://sharedsystems.dhsoha.state.or.us/DHSForms/Served/le2288K.pdf"">Wear face coverings</a> to limit the spread of COVID-19 from people who have the virus but who have no symptoms or have not yet developed symptoms.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">PP&amp;R signs are posted at parks and trailheads to explain what facilities are closed and to share public health guidance. To help people maintain their physical and mental health while safely utilizing their parks system, PP&amp;R has also:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>closed parking lots and park roads at dozens of sites,</li>
<li>locked gates and removed nets at tennis courts where needed,</li>
<li>installed ""Closed"" barrier tape at playgrounds,</li>
<li>locked and flipped over soccer field goalposts,</li>
<li>Park Rangers are already informing the public on safe physical distancing in high traffic areas, and addressing issues as they arise, and</li>
<li>left decorative fountains and splash pads turned off.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">Starting this week, PP&amp;R will redeploy some employees as Park Greeters.&nbsp;While maintaining 6 feet of physical distance, Park Greeters will educate the public about how to use their parks system safely and to explain what facilities are open or closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""xxmsonormal"">PP&amp;R hopes these additional educational resources will positively impact behavior at parks, trails, golf courses, and natural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Concerts in the Park, Movies in the Park, Washington Park Summer Festival, and Portland World Soccer Tournament are canceled this summer.</strong></em></p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation (PP&amp;R) is planning to operate the <a href=""/parks/61921"">Free Lunch + Play</a> program this summer. Access to nutritious food has proven to be one of the highest needs in our community during this public health crisis. PP&amp;R and our partners will play an important role in keeping kids healthy this summer.</p>
<p>57% of young Portlanders qualify for free or reduced-price lunch during the school year. Without school lunches, summer becomes the time when nearly 50,000 Portland children face hunger daily. PP&amp;R&rsquo;s Free Lunch + Play program supports families by offering nutritious meals and recreational activities - arts, crafts, sports, and games - during the summer break from school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few weeks have been unprecedented for all of us as we navigate the COVID-19 global health crisis,&rdquo; says PP&amp;R Director Adena Long. &ldquo;In these circumstances, we must focus on the highest needs of the people we serve. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation will focus on the Free Lunch + Play program to fill the summertime meal gap for thousands of young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Working alongside community partners, Portland Public Schools, David Douglas, Reynolds, Parkrose, and Centennial School Districts, and Oregon Food Bank and Urban Gleaners, PP&amp;R coordinates the Free Lunch + Play program to ensure that it meets the changing needs in our community.</p>
<p>Food access during this time remains one of the highest needs for Portland. Portland Parks &amp; Recreation is prepared to mobilize and provide free meals for children and youth, citywide. If you would like to contribute to this effort&mdash;please make you pledge here: <a href=""https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/152380ce157341e6b55fd0b47ff50e25"">COUNT ME IN!</a></p>
<p>Due to the COVID-19 public health crisis, Portland Parks &amp; Recreation&rsquo;s Summer Free For All program will not include the Concerts in the Park, including the Washington Park Festival, Movies in the Park, and the Portland World Soccer Tournament. This decision will ensure that the bureau&rsquo;s summer offerings can adhere to the guidance of public health officials. In addition, summer preparations, such as hiring, fundraising and planning, normally would occur during the spring and that is not possible this year due to the financial and operational constraints PP&amp;R is enduring at this time.</p>
<p>Portland Parks &amp; Recreation continues to be in communication with, and following the guidance of, the Oregon Health Authority, Multnomah County Health Department, and the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management regarding COVID-19.
