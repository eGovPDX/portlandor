Plans Examiner - January/February 2018 Issue,669731,BDS Budget Update,3,,2018-02-07 18:36:23 UTC,2018-01-18 16:22:00 UTC,A,"BDS Budget and Finance staff submitted BDSâ€™s fiscal year (FY) 2018-19 Requested Budget and updated 5-Year Financial Plan to the City Budget Office on Jan. 29, 2018.","<h2><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=647775"" alt=""Budget"" /></h2>
<p>BDS Budget and Finance staff submitted BDS&rsquo;s fiscal year (FY) 2018-19 Requested Budget and updated 5-Year Financial Plan to the City Budget Office on Jan. 29, 2018. The documents are available for viewing on the City Budget Office website at <a href=""/cbo/article/671187"">https://www.portlandoregon.gov/cbo/article/671187</a>.&nbsp;The Requested Budget and Financial Plan highlight BDS&rsquo;s strategic goals and provide information on our financial, staffing, and service level needs.</p>
<p>The City Budget Office is currently reviewing budget requests from all City bureaus and will make recommendations to the City Council on March 5, 2018&nbsp;regarding bureau budget decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5&nbsp;Percent&nbsp;General Fund Cut</h2>
<p>Historically, BDS has received support from the City&rsquo;s General Fund for local code enforcement programs, including Land Use Services and Neighborhood Inspections.&nbsp;These programs provide services that benefit the entire community through enforcement of the City&rsquo;s zoning, housing, and nuisance regulations. State law prohibits us from using permit revenues to support these local code enforcement programs, so the programs have been funded by a combination of their own fee revenues and the General Fund.</p>
<p>However, General Fund support for BDS has been consistently reduced over the last several years, and currently only Neighborhood Inspections receives General Fund support.&nbsp;For FY 2018-19, the Mayor has again directed bureaus to prepare 5 percent&nbsp;cuts in their General Fund support; bureaus also made 5 percent cuts in FY 2017-18 and FY 2016-17. We&rsquo;ve proposed to make the required 5 percent cut by reducing our spending on nuisance abatements in FY 2018-19 by $49,126.</p>
<p>We made clear in our budget request that this reduction in funds will lead to approximately 27 fewer nuisance abatements completed in FY 2018-19 (21&nbsp;percent fewer abatements than were done in FY 2016-17), potentially resulting in serious health and sanitation concerns at those properties. We intend to replace these funds from Neighborhood Inspections program reserves so that services are not impacted.</p>
<h2>Adding Positions Via 2018 Spring Budget Monitoring Process (BMP)</h2>
<p>BDS managers reviewed workload and performance data and identified a handful of additional fee-supported staff positions that will be needed.&nbsp;These positions are being held over to the 2018 Spring Budget Monitoring Process (BMP), rather than using the FY 2018-19 Requested Budget.&nbsp;This will allow us to fill the positions during the current fiscal year, rather than waiting until after July 1, 2018.&nbsp; BMPs provide bureaus with opportunities to adjust their budgets during the year, including adding positions. These additional positions are reflected in the 5-Year Financial Plan.</p>
<p>Thanks to continued strong revenues and financial reserves, BDS does not anticipate increases to most fees in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Upcoming Budget Events</h2>
<p>Upcoming steps in the budget process include:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 5, 2018&nbsp;&ndash; City Budget Office makes budget recommendations to City Council</li>
<li>March 15 &ndash; 29, 2018 &ndash; City Council Budget Work Sessions</li>

<p>In December 2017, City Council approved the IGA, and planning is now underway to conduct the surveys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current schedule calls for the employee survey to be conducted first, in early spring, followed by the customer survey and the community survey at later dates.&nbsp;The surveys will be conducted primarily online.&nbsp;The BDS Equity Committee (BEC), Labor Management Committee (LMC) and Management Team are currently reviewing the employee survey and will also be reviewing the customer and community surveys.</p>
<p>The customer and community surveys will gauge attitudes and opinions regarding the quality, effectiveness and timeliness of BDS programs and services.&nbsp;Over the last 15 years, results and analysis from similar surveys has helped us set operational priorities and make decisions regarding programs and services that impact customers and the community.&nbsp;The last BDS customer/community survey was conducted in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

Plans Examiner - January/February 2018 Issue,669738,State approves Portland's 2035 Comprehensive Plan,3,,2018-02-07 18:51:08 UTC,2018-01-18 16:22:00 UTC,A,The Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) issued an order approving Portlandâ€™s 2035 Comprehensive Plan and responding to objections raised against the new plan and associated implementation measures.,"<p><img title=""2035 CP Photo"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=672211"" alt=""2035 CP Photo"" width=""640"" height=""295"" /></p>
<p>The new comprehensive plan was adopted by the Portland City Council in June 2016. The plan includes a new policy document, updated land use map designations, and a new <em>Citywide Systems Plan</em>, which includes both a <em>Public Facilities Plan</em> and <em>Transportation System Plan</em>. In December 2016 Council also adopted a corresponding set of <a href=""/bps/72545""><em>Zoning Code</em> and <em>Zoning Map</em></a> updates.</p>
<p>In the <a href=""/bps/article/665407"">Press Release - Portland Land Use Plan Approved</a>, the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD)&rsquo;s director stated, &ldquo;Portland is an attractive city with lots of people moving there each year. The City Council had to make difficult choices about how to best accommodate the expected growth.&nbsp;Our review found the plan to be consistent with the state&rsquo;s requirements for efficient, managed use of land.&rdquo;&nbsp;The agency also noted: &ldquo;Portland&rsquo;s plan also includes a focus on equitable decision-making. A new section of the plan includes a commitment to more fully engage both conventional and less traditional communities within the city when considering land use and investment choices.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Periodic Review provides for objections </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Oregon land use law, the state must approve local comprehensive plans for consistency with the Statewide Planning Goals.&nbsp;The new plan was produced under that state mandate called &ldquo;<a href=""/bps/59282"">Periodic Review</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;The plan was originally scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2018. This was designed to allow time for the state of Oregon, through the DLCD, to review the plan.</p>
<p>Periodic Review provides opportunities for people who participated in the local planning process to object to state approval.&nbsp;The DLCD then considers objections and issues an order. About a dozen individuals and organizations objected to the adopted plan.&nbsp;Several organizations filed multiple objections.</p>
<p>The DLCD's order invalidated some objections and rejected the remainder.&nbsp;Now, there is another opportunity for people who filed valid, but rejected, objections to request a hearing before the Oregon Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ordinance delays effective date of the plan</strong></p>
<p>City Council passed an <a href=""/bps/article/665409"">ordinance delaying the effective date</a> of the new plan until 1 p.m. on May 24, 2018 to provide time for a possible LCDC hearing. The City will learn if any valid objectors have requested an LCDC hearing by late December.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/669738

Plans Examiner - January/February 2018 Issue,672159,Asbestos and Lead-Based Paint Mitigation in Residential Demolitions (SB 871 Implementation Ordinance),3,,2018-02-07 17:52:26 UTC,2018-02-06 22:07:00 UTC,A,"On Feb. 1, 2018, the Portland City Council passed an ordinance implementing Senate Bill 871 that addresses asbestos and lead-based paint in residential demolitions.","<p><img title="""" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=662232"" alt=""Photo of Asbestos and Lead-Based Paint in Residential Demolitions"" width=""660"" height=""282"" /></p>
<p>On Feb. 1, 2018, the Portland City Council passed an ordinance implementing Senate Bill 871 that addresses asbestos and lead-based paint in residential demolitions.</p>
<p>Over the course of several months, the Bureau of Development Services staff met with the Oregon Health Authority, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Oregon Construction Contractor&rsquo;s Board, Multnomah County&rsquo;s Lead Program Coordinator, the Development Review Advisory Committee (DRAC) Demolition Subcommittee, and other stakeholders to develop the ordinance, which adopts best practices for addressing asbestos, lead-based paint and other hazards related to residential demolitions.</p>
<p>Based on the recommendations of the DRAC Demolition Subcommittee and other stakeholders, BDS drafted the new ordinance that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applies to residential structures with 1-4 dwelling units, regardless of zone, and all accessory structures on the site (accessory structure is anything over 200 square feet, up to 3,000 square feet). Includes mixed-use structures.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Requires a demolition plan outlining the techniques and equipment that will be used on the demolition site to control dust and debris generated during demolition.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Requires a demolition manager to be designated for the project responsible for implementing and overseeing the demolition plan.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Requires removal of all non-load-bearing painted materials from the exterior prior to mechanical demolition activities, and a copy of the asbestos survey to be provided to BDS as a condition of permit issuance.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>A person with the specified accreditation for asbestos and lead-based paint must be on site during demolition activities.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Provides for two new inspections to ensure compliance with the ordinance.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Prohibits mechanical demolition activities when wind speeds exceed 25 miles per hour.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Requires containment of demolition debris on-site.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Applicants must post door hangers on properties within 300 feet of the demolition site with information relating to the demolition, including contact information and approximate date of demolition, and post information onsite with demolition manager contact information (the same posting that is currently required for site control).&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
<li>Requires finalizing the demolition permit before obtaining a subsequent building permit on the site.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>BDS will hire two new Site Development Inspector I positions to administer the additional workload associated with this ordinance. BDS will increase the demolition fees by $180 per demolition permit to cover the costs of administering the ordinance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ordinance took effect immediately, with an implementation date no later than July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>BDS will be host a <strong>&ldquo;Lunch &amp; Learn&rdquo;</strong> from noon to 1 p.m. on <strong>March 23, 2018</strong>, at 1900 S.W. 4<sup>th</sup> Ave., in Room 2500 B/C to present the new requirements in the ordinance.&nbsp;</p>

Plans Examiner - March/April 2018 Issue,679633,BDS Budget Update,3,,2018-04-10 18:44:14 UTC,2018-04-09 21:04:00 UTC,A,Spring is a busy time of year for BDS budget staff. Learn more about the budget process and what it may mean for the bureau.,"<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=647775"" alt=""Budget"" />Spring is a busy time of year for BDS budget staff. As the BDS Fiscal Year (FY) 2018-19 budget continues to work its way through the approval process, we are also preparing a request to add 17 new staff positions to this year&rsquo;s (FY 2017-18) budget through the City&rsquo;s Spring Budget Monitoring Process (BMP).These positions will help us address continuing high workloads and improve service levels.</p>
<h2>BDS FY 2018-19 Budget</h2>
<p>Readers may recall that the only significant &ldquo;request&rdquo; (also known as a Decision Package) in our FY 2018-19 Requested Budget was the 5 percent General Fund reduction required by the City Council. We proposed to take 5 percent out of our Neighborhood Inspections Program, since this is the only BDS program that receives General Fund support. The cut would come from our nuisance abatement funds, in order to avoid cutting staff positions.</p>
<p>However, after reviewing our Requested Budget, the City Budget Office (CBO) recommended that the City Council not take the 5 percent &nbsp;cut from BDS.&nbsp; We met with the City Council on March 16<sup>,</sup> to discuss our Requested Budget and the CBO&rsquo;s recommendations, and we are now waiting for Mayor Wheeler to release his Proposed Budget in May.</p>
<h2>Upcoming events in the FY 2018-19 budget process include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>April 17 &ndash; Public Hearing on the City Budget</li>
<li>May 7 &ndash; Mayor&rsquo;s Proposed Budget released</li>
<li>June 7 &ndash; City Council vote on Adopted Budget</li>
<li>July 1 &ndash; FY 2018-19 Budget goes into effect</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>FY 2017-18 Spring Budget Monitoring Process (BMP) &ndash; BDS Requesting 17 Fee-Supported Positions</strong></h2>
<p>The Budget Monitoring Process (BMP) provides opportunities for City bureaus to make adjustments to their current fiscal year budgets, including adding positions. BDS has used BMPs in the last few years to add staff positions to high-priority programs and services in response to workload increases. Adding positions through the BMP (rather than the FY 2018-19 Requested Budget) allows us to fill those positions sooner.</p>
<p>Our FY 2017-18 Spring BMP request, due on March 26, will include a request for 17 additional fee-supported staff positions, including:</p>
<p><strong>Portland Online Permitting System (POPS) (1 position)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Training &amp; Development Analyst (staff training)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Inspections Services (6 positions)</strong></p>

As part of early implementation of the 2035 Comprehensive Plan, the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability created the&nbsp;<em>Neighborhood Contact Code Update&nbsp;</em>project to<em>&nbsp;</em>address community desire to have more information about new large buildings in the area.</p>
<p>The project is addressing issues related to neighborhood notification of new development, such as:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>How should developers be required to notify people about new development in their neighborhood?</li>
<li>What should trigger the notification; for instance, number of units in the new development?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Review the Discussion Draft and send BPS your comments</strong></p>
<p>The Neighborhood Contact Code Update project released a <a href=""/bps/74046"">Discussion Draft for public review</a>. The document includes a proposal and an appendix with draft materials that will be finalized by the Bureau of Development Services (BDS) after adoption of code changes in late 2018.</p>
<p><em>What would the proposal change?</em></p>
<p>The code changes proposed in this draft would change both the required&nbsp;<em>process</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>triggers</em>&nbsp;of the existing Neighborhood Contact Requirement.</p>
<p>Currently, the&nbsp;<em>process</em>&nbsp;requires applicants to offer information about the project at a neighborhood association meeting. The proposed changes to the&nbsp;<em>process</em>&nbsp;would:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Shift the focus from a meeting to an onsite sign with information about the project, posted 35 days before the permit application is submitted.</li>
<li>Require that informational emails be sent at the same time to the neighborhood association, business association and district coalition.</li>
<li>Require the applicant to host an informational meeting only for larger projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the requirement is applied to new development inconsistently in a variety of situations because the&nbsp;<em>triggers</em>&nbsp;have been added piecemeal over time. The proposed changes to the&nbsp;<em>triggers</em>&nbsp;would make them simpler and more standardized, applying to all projects with more than 10,000 square feet of new building.</p>
<p><em>How can I provide feedback?</em></p>
<p>Comments on the Discussion Draft (link to Discussion Draft page) are due on April 23, 2018. You can submit your comments any of these ways:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">

<li>U.S. Mail: Neighborhood Contact Project, Bureau of Planning and Sustainability, 1900 S.W. Fourth&nbsp;Ave., Portland, Oregon 97201</li>
</ul>
<p>Project staff will weigh comments against each other and the City&rsquo;s goals and policies to produce the Proposed Draft, which will be submitted to the Planning and Sustainability Commission in late spring/early summer.</p>

He&rsquo;s working to prevent that.</em></strong></p>
<p><em style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><em><img class=""content-center"" title=""There are around 1650 URM buildings in Portland&mdash;Kumar suggests that they should be publicly labeled so residents of Portland are aware of the risks. "" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=674810"" alt=""There are around 1650 URM buildings in Portland&mdash;Kumar suggests that they should be publicly labeled so residents of Portland are aware of the risks. "" width=""660"" height=""440"" /></em><em>There are about 1,650 URM buildings in Portland. Amit Kumar says publicly labeling them would help raise awareness about safety.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In 1994,&nbsp;<strong>Amit Kumar</strong>&nbsp;remembers visiting the Los Angeles area of Northridge, California in the aftermath of a 6.7 magnitude earthquake.</p>
<p>The quake lasted approximately 20 seconds, caused billions of dollars of damage, injured nearly 9,000 people and killed 57 others. He saw collapsed buildings and a hospital that had to be evacuated. &ldquo;I was new in the profession,&rdquo; Kumar says, &ldquo;so it really hit me hard. I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to earthquakes in our area before I saw the wreckage in Northridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Working for a structural engineering consulting company in Portland at the time, Kumar went to help the local office as they focused on earthquake recovery. The Northridge community suffered the loss of many historic adobe buildings, and it caused everyone to reflect on the regulations of unreinforced masonry buildings, known as URMs.</p>
<p>Today, Kumar is a&nbsp;<strong>Senior Structural Engineer</strong>&nbsp;in Plan Review Services at BDS, where he uses his passion for public safety to advocate for improving safety throughout Portland Metro.</p>
<p>After 30 years of working on improving URM buildings, Kumar says there is a universal understanding that these structures can be dangerous in the event of an earthquake. &ldquo;You hear about earthquakes all around the world, and every single time you hear primarily about URM buildings causing the most damage,&rdquo; Kumar says.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 1,650 URM buildings in Portland, and Kumar sees his role as helping to make sure that these structures are upgraded to a level that will prevent them from collapsing if the city is hit by a quake.</p>
<p>Kumar says that many residents don&rsquo;t consider an earthquake to be a threat. &ldquo;For some, it&rsquo;s out of sight, out of mind,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Science, though, shows we will experience a major earthquake along the Interstate 5 corridor at some point. Studies by earthquake experts say a major quake hits this area every 300 years. They say we are long overdue and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before it happens.</p>
<p>The City&rsquo;s job? To plan ahead. For the last few years, the City has engaged staff from BDS, the Bureau of Emergency Management, Prosper Portland, as well as local engineers, architects, and geologists on multiple committees to determine how to engage over safety standards. Also, a committee made up of residents, including URM building owners and other stakeholders has made recommendations to City staff.</p>
<p>The Portland City Council will hear about the work and the recommendation on May 9, 2018 at 3 p.m. and decide how to move forward. Under consideration are ways to strengthen existing URMs, how to move construction forward in a timely manner and how to help people pay for upgrades.</p>
<p><em style=""font-size: 1.1em;""><img class=""content-center"" title=""Every building at the intersection of SW 11th Avenue and SW Stark Street is on the list of URMs, including this one that houses the Fish Grotto and Joyce Hotel."" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=674449"" alt=""Every building at the intersection of SW 11th Avenue and SW Stark Street is on the list of URMs, including this one that houses the Fish Grotto and Joyce Hotel."" width=""660"" height=""440"" /><em>Every building at the intersection of SW 11th Avenue and SW Stark Street is on the list of URMs, including this one that houses the Fish Grotto and Joyce Hotel.</em><br /></em></p>
<p>City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly praises the bureau&rsquo;s efforts at making a difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Engineering team, led by Amit Kumar, did an excellent job of working with the community to frame policy options that make the engineering choices and consequences clear for the City Council,&rdquo; says Commissioner Eudaly. &ldquo;That work has made it possible for us to have forward-thinking discussions about how to provide financial supports for doing URM work on properties owned by the city, the school district, affordable housing and faith-based nonprofits as well as privately owned properties. The bureau&rsquo;s terrific work will make our city significantly safer. Many thanks to Amit Kumar and the whole Engineering team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kumar says contributions from his team were essential to the URM recommendations under consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shelly Duquette</strong>, a&nbsp;<strong>Structural Engineer</strong>&nbsp;at BDS, was integral in the update and maintenance of the old URM database.&nbsp;<strong>Jake Brown</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong>BTS GIS</strong>&nbsp;created an interactive map for the database to make it more accessible to customers.&nbsp;<strong>Eric Thomas</strong>, also a&nbsp;<strong>Structural Engineer</strong>, provided technical support in the URM policy development and provided historical context on previous city policies. And&nbsp;<strong>Andy Peterson</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong>Plan Review Services Manager</strong>, provided support and encouragement as the team worked at developing suggestions for the URM policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without the help and support of the team working together toward a common goal, we would not be where we are today on this project,&rdquo; Kumar says. Kumar knows that the expense of safety measures can make things tough for building owners. But making the buildings safe might not be as expensive as many fear. That&rsquo;s why the City will continue to examine how to best help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have an obligation to keep our citizens safe,&rdquo; Kumar says. &ldquo;There is a cost associated, but a partnership needs to be built between the public and the City to upgrade existing URM buildings.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Budget Request for FY 2018-19 Budget</h2>
<p>After several public budget forums and hearings, Mayor Wheeler released his Proposed Budget in early May. The good news for BDS was that the required 5% cut in General Fund support was restored, meaning that we will not have to make a 5% cut in our Neighborhood Inspections Program budget (this is the only BDS program that receives General Fund support). On May 16, City Council approved the Proposed Budget. The FY 2018-19 budget was adopted by the Council on June 7 and is effective July 1, 2018.</p>
<h2><strong>17 New Fee-Supported Positions Approved Through FY 2017-18 Spring Budget Monitoring Process (BMP)</strong></h2>
<p>The Budget Monitoring Process (BMP) provides opportunities for City bureaus to make adjustments to their current fiscal year budgets, including adding positions. BDS has used BMPs in the last few years to add staff positions to high-priority programs and services in response to workload increases. Adding positions through the BMP (rather than the FY 2018-19 budget process) allows us to fill those positions sooner.<br />&nbsp;<br />On March 2<sup>nd</sup> City Council approved our FY 2017-18 Spring BMP request for 17 additional fee-supported staff positions.

<li>DRAC (Development Review Advisory Committee)</li>
<li>Development industry</li>
<li>BDS (employees and managers)</li>
<li>Community organizations</li>
<li>Neighborhoods</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></strong>The BAC evaluates the BDS budget request in light of the City&rsquo;s budget directions, BDS&rsquo;s budget goals, and the needs of customers and the community. The BAC will meet several times during the budget preparation process (October 2018 through January 2019), and will submit a report with our budget request. All BAC meetings are open to the public.</p>
<p><strong>Interested in joining the BAC?</strong> We&rsquo;re looking for BDS customers, industry and community stakeholders, and/or people who have an interest in BDS&rsquo;s budget and work to join our BAC.

Plans Examiner - July/August Issue,692971,Stormwater Management Manual (SWMM),3,,2018-08-06 21:50:06 UTC,2018-08-02 15:56:00 UTC,A,Clarifications for Partial-Coverage Ecoroofs,"<p><img class=""content-center"" title=""Ecoroof"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=692970"" alt=""Ecoroof with bridge in background"" width=""600"" height=""316"" /></p>
<p>Appropriate and effective stormwater management is critical to maintaining and enhancing the City&rsquo;s livability and improving watershed health. Stormwater management standards and requirements are found in the Stormwater Management Manual at <a href=""/bes/SWMM"">www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/SWMM</a>. These requirements allow the City of Portland to protect both watershed resources and infrastructure investments with every development or improvement.</p>
<p>Portland&rsquo;s recently enacted Central City 2035 Plan (CC2035) includes a standard requiring ecoroofs on most new buildings in the Central City Plan District (see Zoning Code chapter 33.510). The standard is implemented by BDS and is intended to maximize ecoroof coverage in the Central City because of the multiple benefits they provide, including stormwater management. An ecoroof constructed to meet the CC2035 zoning standard will also count toward the project&rsquo;s stormwater management obligations reviewed by Environmental Services, but additional stormwater management may be required if the ecoroof coverage is insufficient to meet the site&rsquo;s entire stormwater obligation.</p>
<p>Because the CC2035 standard will likely result in a significant number of partial ecoroofs (i.e. &lt;100% total roof coverage), questions about stormwater requirements for the non-ecoroof area in these situations will likely arise. To address those questions, Environmental Services is clarifying some of our existing SWMM rules to fit this new regulatory context. Although spurred by the adoption of a new plan that only applies to Portland&rsquo;s central city, these SWMM clarifications apply City-wide. Specifically, for partial-coverage ecoroofs, the following clarifications should be considered in building and site design as applicable to individual sites:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong><em>Ecoroof Coverage and Infiltration:</em></strong> For all development, the SWMM currently requires applicants to investigate the feasibility of infiltrating post-development stormwater into native soils on-site; if feasible, infiltration facilities must be constructed. The SWMM also says that &ldquo;Ecoroofs&hellip; can be used without consideration of onsite infiltration rates&rdquo; and that managed stormwater from an ecoroof &ldquo;is allowed to overflow to an approvable offsite discharge location&rdquo; (p. 1-26), but doesn&rsquo;t say whether these allowances start at a certain coverage percentage or if they only apply to a 100% coverage ecoroof. Environmental Services now clarifies that the investigation of onsite infiltration for a building is waived <em>only when the ecoroof covers &ge; 60% of the building</em>; if the ecoroof coverage is &#706;60%, the feasibility of infiltrating building runoff onsite must be investigated per the SWMM.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ground Level Impervious Areas:</em></strong> For incidental ground-level impervious areas associated with an adjacent building that has &ge; 60% ecoroof, such as concrete areas that are inset to match building articulation, onsite infiltration does not need to be investigated. However, larger impervious areas that allow sufficient space to install an infiltration facility, such as parking lots, must be investigated for the feasibility of infiltrating stormwater per the SWMM.</li>
<li><strong><em>Pollution Reduction: </em></strong>Pollution reduction must be provided for all non-ecoroof area when discharging to a storm-only system (Category 3 in the SWMM Infiltration and Discharge Hierarchy). Pollution reduction is not required in the combined system (Category 4).</li>
<li><strong><em>Flow Control: </em></strong>Flow control must be provided for all non-ecoroof area. A partial ecoroof can contribute toward meeting the site&rsquo;s overall flow control obligation, and in some cases a partial ecoroof may be all that is required. To assess this, the project engineer must calculate flow control using the Santa Barbara Urban Hydrograph method using a 5-minute time of concentration, an ecoroof curve number of 61 (from SWMM Table A-4), and a weighted curve number for the entire roof area per the formula provided in the handout linked to below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to the new handout <a href=""/bes/article/691262"">Guidance on CC2035 Ecoroof Requirements and the SWMM</a> for more information about partial-coverage ecoroofs and the relationship between the SWMM and CC2035.

<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=693387"" alt=""POPS Logo"" width=""135"" height=""86.4"" />The Bureau of Development Services is rolling out electronic plan review for two large development projects. With electronic plan review (PDX ePlans), customers can submit their plans online to be reviewed electronically. Staff at BDS and our partner bureaus review the plans simultaneously on their computer screens. And if you need to make a correction to the plans, you can submit those corrections online for re-review, saving a trip to the Development Services Center.</p>
<p>To ensure everything is running smoothly with PDX ePlans, BDS will implement the program for two large commercial building permits, <strong>E2*</strong> and <strong>Halsey 106* </strong>(more information below), then expand to other projects. After January 1, 2019, all commercial permit applications with a BDS process manager assigned will use the ePlans system instead of submitting paper plans in person at the Development Services Center. Later phases will follow for other project and permit types.</p>
<p>PDX ePlans is one of six improvements planned by the POPS program, to make our services more accessible to the community and increase the efficiency of the permitting process. The other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Permitting system (TRACS) upgrade (AMANDA):</strong> TRACS is the backbone of how BDS and interagency partners track and process permit applications and manage cases. Although the database was upgraded to a supported version in 2017, staff currently use desktop software from 1999. This next upgrade will allow staff to do their work much more quickly, and we're calling it AMANDA.</li>
<li><strong>Inspections Scheduling:</strong> City inspectors currently do their scheduling and routing manually every morning. This administrative work can be automated through an inspections scheduling system.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App for Inspectors:</strong> The Inspector App will allow inspectors to do more of their work in the field. They&rsquo;ll be able to view permitting system information, as well as take notes and pictures, right from their fingertips.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Web Portal for Customers:</strong> The BDS online permit portal is being revamped to allow customers to track and pay for more types of permit applications. POPS will continue to add more services to the portal, called Development Hub PDX, after it&rsquo;s revamped.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile App for Contractors and Applicants:</strong> BDS will offer an app to contractors to track permit inspections through an app on their phone or mobile device. They&rsquo;ll be able to get text messages with information about the status of their inspections requests and results.</li>
</ul>
<p>BDS is excited to share these coming improvements with you. We are committed to looking for ways to improve and put our customers at the center of our work. Our staff are proud to be taking steps toward a more efficient, transparent, and convenient plan review process. We appreciate your patience while we make these improvements and look forward to faster permitting in the City of Portland.</p>

<p><strong>* The E2 project and Halsey 106</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>E2 project</strong>, submitted on July 27, is a multi-story mixed-use residential building with ground floor retail located on SW Moody Avenue. The building includes townhome style units on SW Macadam Avenue. Parking will be located in the lowest level of the building with access on SW Abernethy Street. The current plan for E2 proposes a below grade level for the building to allow parking and facility services underground.</p>
<p><strong>Halsey 106</strong> is a new six-story building with 45 affordable housing units, 30 market-rate apartments, tuck-under parking, 10,000 sq. foot of retail and 10,700 sq. foot of office space. This multi-use building will include a community room and a green roof deck. Located at NE Halsey and 106<sup>th</sup> Avenue, Halsey 106 is a Portland Housing Bureau affordable housing project. The plans are likely to be submitted in mid-September of this year by Cory Hawbecker with Holst Architects. Hawbecker says he is thrilled to be a part of the ePlans pilot and is really looking forward to providing feedback as one of the first projects to use this new tool.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/693338

<p><strong>Bike Parking Code Update</strong></p>
<p>Portland is growing, and more people are riding bicycles to commute and travel around the city. To support this growth and continue to encourage bicycling as a safe mode of transportation, the City uses standards and guidelines to encourage secure, accessible and convenient bicycle parking in all new developments and major redevelopments.</p>
<p>The City of Portland is updating the Bicycle Parking Chapter (33.266.200) of the Zoning Code to ensure that developments provide adequate short- and long-term bike parking. Most of the bicycle parking chapter has not been updated in 20 years. With changes in technology, design and the way people get around town, this project is an opportunity to ensure the standards better match City goals.&nbsp;</p>

When complete, it will make our services more accessible to the community and increase the efficiency of the permitting process.</p>
<p>To ensure that the services we offer are helpful to the community, the POPS team is consulting a newly assembled POPS Customer Advisory Committee (CAC).</p>
<p>The CAC is an advisory body representing our customers with interests in permitting, development review, and public access to information. This committee will help identify problems with current business processes, and review and provide feedback on planned implementation of POPS. With their help, the POPS team will be more informed on how our work will affect customers.</p>

<p>To recruit CAC members, the POPS team worked with the Equity Team and the Office of Community and Civic Life. The Customer Advisory Committee has 12 members who collectively represent architects, developers, engineers, permit/land use consultants, contractors, neighborhood representatives, tradespeople, low income housing specialists, and people of color in our community.</p>

<p>Jennifer Hoffman of Opsis Architecture (shown here at the September CAC meeting) says she is encouraged by the City of Portland&rsquo;s efforts to collect and integrate customer feedback during the implementation process. In her role as an architect, she has experience interacting with the bureau from planning to permitting services. &ldquo;I feel it is part of my professional responsibility to help improve the systems we all use to become easier, cost effective and more efficient,&rdquo; Jennifer says. &ldquo;I hope to provide valuable feedback and guidance from a customer (architect / developer / owner) standpoint to those designing, implementing and training within the POPS program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CAC convened in September. At this initial meeting, the POPS team provided an overview of the status of the program. Angie Tomlinson, Electronic Plan Review Manager, provided an in-depth explanation of ePlans at that meeting and provided an opportunity for customers to have their questions answered.</p>
<p>In October, the CAC learned details on the Public Portal scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2019.&nbsp; In November, the committee will be some of the first to review the BETA version of the Public Portal.

<p>During the&nbsp;rainy season, between October 1st and April 30th, ground-disturbing construction work requires increased attention. Wet weather site and erosion control measures are necessary to implement throughout the City. Additionally, there are area-specific locations in which ground-disturbing work is either limited or prohibited entirely&nbsp;between&nbsp;October 1st and April 30th.</p>
<p><strong>Area-specific limitations:</strong>&nbsp;Ground-disturbing construction work is prohibited between October 1st&nbsp;and April 30th&nbsp;within the Balch Creek and Forest Park Subdistricts of the Northwest Hills Plan District.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/bds/article/591572"">Map of the affected areas</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exposed earth is required to be covered and stabilized no later than October 1st.</strong>&nbsp;All construction activity which exposes soil to stormwater, including sewer, water and utility trenching, must stop during this seasonal prohibition on ground-disturbing activities. If you have questions, please call the Planning &amp; Zoning section of the Bureau of Development Services at 503-823-7526.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>General Requirements:</strong>&nbsp;Projects in other areas of the City must comply with&nbsp;<a href=""/citycode/28175"">Title 10 Erosion Control Regulations</a>. In most cases, construction activity may continue, but wet weather erosion control measures are required between October 1st&nbsp;and April 30th, including logging daily inspections of erosion control measures and providing temporary ground cover on exposed soils and stockpiles.&nbsp;A few additional requirements to note include:</p>
<ul>
<li>All site development, construction, and demolition sites are required to post the&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/298261"" target=""_blank"">Erosion Concerns Hotline signage</a>&nbsp;at a location that is readable from the public right-of way.</li>
<li>You must complete an erosion control inspection log and have it available onsite.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The rainy season is a great time to brush up on your erosion control knowledge. Take time to review the City&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/94539"" target=""_blank"">Erosion and Sediment Control Manual</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/205357"">plastic sheeting detail for stockpiles</a>, or download them for quick reference on-site.

Plans Examiner - September/October Issue,700729,Coming Soon: A More Efficient Plan Review Process,3,,2018-11-02 16:44:37 UTC,2018-10-18 16:40:00 UTC,A,"Over the next year, the City is phasing in a new more efficient plan review process for all types of building permits. This new process will establish dedicated windows of uninterrupted time for City staff to perform plan review.","<p>Over the next year, the City is phasing in a new more efficient plan review process for all types of building permits. This new process will establish dedicated windows of uninterrupted time for City staff to perform plan review. During these windows, applicants will not be allowed to submit corrections to checksheets. These review windows will create a more efficient development review process. This new process will be standard when electronic plan review is rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>Phasing of Review Windows</strong></p>
<p>We will be gradually phasing review windows into our process, starting with Process Managed Projects on November 1, 2018, and then New Single Family Residential (NSFR) Permits on January 2, 2019. Plan review windows should be fully implemented by October 1, 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we move closer to the implementation of review windows for NSFR Permits we will send our additional public notifications, as well as hold a Lunch and Learn event.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the change will benefit our customers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced interruption to the plan review process.</strong> Our staff will be able to focus on their reviews with less&nbsp;interruptions, which will produce more efficient review and feedback for our customers. When a customer submits&nbsp;corrections through a checksheet response, Permitting Services staff coordinates those corrections and routes&nbsp;the plans to our review groups in response to those corrections/updates. When customers submit additional&nbsp;corrections before other staff have finished their review, the reviewer must start over. When staff have&nbsp;uninterrupted time to focus on a review, they can complete that review more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Less routing of plans to reviewers.</strong> Bundling correction submittals reduces the amount of times Permitting&nbsp;Services staff need to route plans. This allows them to spend more time on the last stage of the review process,&nbsp;preissuance of permits.</li>
<li><strong>We are moving to ePlans (electronic plan review), which fully incorporates plan review windows.</strong> ePlans is a plan&nbsp;review system enabling plans to be reviewed, stamped and downloaded electronically. Applicants will be able&nbsp;to submit their plans remotely and view their project&rsquo;s status and details. Upon submittal, plans are&nbsp;immediately made available to all reviewers simultaneously, reducing the time needed to complete the&nbsp;review process. The City of Portland is currently in the first phase of the rollout with three applicants&nbsp;participating in the pilot program. Review windows are necessary to manage the electronic plan review process&nbsp;and requiring them for our current paper-based process will help applicants and City staff as we make the&nbsp;transition to ePlans.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are making this change to complete reviews and permits on a shorter timeline for our customers. BDS is always looking for ways to make our processes more efficient, and plan review windows will help our staff work quickly, producing results faster. More detailed information about plan review windows will be published as the implementation date nears.</p>
<p><strong>Save the date:</strong> We will be hosting a Lunch &amp; Learn information session on Plan Review Windows on December 10 at the Bureau of Development Services. You are welcome to join us at 12 p.m. to discuss the upcoming changes. Please contact <a href=""mailto:colleen.poole@portlandoregon.gov"">Colleen Poole</a> with questions about the Lunch &amp; Learn event series.</p>

<p>The Portland Design Commission sees Design Review as a mechanism to strengthen Portland as a city designed for people. In the last year, the Portland Design Commission has faced a steady increase in workload, and the number of Type III approvals they&rsquo;ve issued has increased (see graphs below).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The State of the City presentation highlighted projects from 2017 and the first half of 2018 that demonstrated <strong>design excellence </strong>in the built environment.</p>
<p>Mayor Ted Wheeler, who recently became the Commissioner-in-Charge of the Bureau of Development Services, joined a tour of developments in northwest Portland in October. Led by the BDS Design and Historic Resources Review staff, the tour included a comparison of development that went through design review and some that applied the prescribed standard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is obvious to me that Portland is rapidly walking towards being a globally recognized city and certainly the integrity of our architecture is a huge part of that,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to working with the Design Commission to talk about how we unfold the Central City Plan in the 2035 Comprehensive Plan, how we actually continue to uphold these values to make what pragmatic changes we can to improve the process but not lose sight of the core goals of what make this city a really great place to be,&rdquo; Mayor Wheeler said. &ldquo;(The Design Commission) has made a huge investment in time and energy. You bring a lot of talent to the table. And by doing so you're benefiting all of us. I'm not just saying that as Mayor, I&rsquo;m saying that as someone who lives in the city, loves the city, and appreciates the way we come together to address our mutual needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commissioner Nick Fish shared both his concern for protecting design review and his gratitude for the Commission&rsquo;s continued efforts. &ldquo;Portlanders are very proud of their city, but they also take the long-term view and they want to build something that we can be proud of not just today, but tomorrow,&rdquo; Fish said. &ldquo;We have something unique and special here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Improvements to Administrative Processes</strong></p>
<p>The Design Commission has recently implemented administrative improvements in response to the Design Overlay Zone Assessment (DOZA). The DOZA Assessment evaluated the design review process and provided recommendations to improve its process and tools. The assessment was a City-led effort alongside a team of consultants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many administrative efforts by the Bureau of Development Services staff and the Commission focus on process improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved public outreach tools</li>
<li>Hearings efficiencies</li>
<li>Improved agendas</li>
<li>Renters included in mailed notifications</li>
<li>Neighborhood Association trainings</li>
<li>Design Advice Request (DAR) improvements</li>
<li>Courtesy DARs for 100% affordable housing cases</li>
<li>Increased staffing and professional development</li>
<li>Commission trainings and regular retreats</li>
<li>Developed Design Commission bylaws</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a <a href=""/bds/article/696630"">full list of improvements here.</a></p>
<p>Additionally, BDS staff are currently proposing a revision of the Purpose statement of the Design Overlay Zone. The proposal (below) recognizes the expanded role of the design overlay zone as it applies to areas of growth and change and updates the focus to consider the three tenets of design.</p>
<p><strong>33.420.010 Purpose (<em>Proposed Revision)</em></strong></p>
<p>The Design overlay zone strengthens Portland as a city designed for people and supports the city&rsquo;s evolution within current and emerging centers of civic life. It promotes <strong>design excellence </strong>in the built environment through the application of additional design guidelines and standards that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build on <strong>context </strong>by enhancing the distinctive physical, natural, historic and cultural qualities of the location while accommodating growth and change;</li>
<li>Contribute to a <strong>public realm </strong>that encourages social interaction and fosters inclusivity in people&rsquo;s daily experience; and</li>
<li>Promotes <strong>quality </strong>and <strong>long-term resilience </strong>in the face of changing demographics, climate and economy.</li>

<p>BDS Budget and Finance staff submitted the fiscal year (FY) 2019-20 BDS Requested Budget and 5-Year Financial Plan to the City Budget Office on February 4, 2019. Both documents (plus the BDS Equity Assessment Report) are available for viewing on the <a href=""/cbo/article/711623"">City Budget Office website</a>.&nbsp; Budget documents for all City bureaus can be viewed <a href=""/cbo/78554"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Requested Budget and Financial Plan for BDS highlights our strategic goals and provides information on our financial, staffing, and service level needs.</p>
<p>The City Budget Office is currently reviewing budget submissions from all City bureaus and made budget recommendations to the City Council on March 5, 2019.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Impacts of Construction Slowdown</strong></strong></p>
<p>Our budget reflects the current slowing in construction in Portland that is having a significant impact on BDS revenues.</p>
<p>Land use applications have been decreasing since the beginning of 2018, and permit applications have begun to slow down in the last several months. We&rsquo;ve responded by reducing many non-mandatory expenditures, leaving vacant staff positions unfilled, and putting a freeze on most bureau hiring through the end of 2019, but it is clear that further steps are needed to protect the bureau&rsquo;s financial health. Adding to the difficulty is the fact that revenues are falling faster than the workload. This makes it more challenging to support the level of staffing that&rsquo;s needed to process incoming work.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re taking a series of steps to address these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the decrease in land use revenues, the FY 2019-20 budget request includes a reduction of 11.0 FTE from the Land Use Services Program through the elimination of vacant positions. The program laid off 3 staff in December 2018 and is reducing staff by another 15 positions through layoffs and reassignments in the current calendar year. Land Use Services has been rapidly going through its financial reserves, and State regulations prohibit us from moving funds to Land Use from our building code programs.</li>
<li>We are reviewing all of our fee schedules and will likely be making adjustments to some fees. Most bureau fees have not been raised in the last 5 years, despite increasing costs to BDS to provide services. Due to the dire need in Land Use Services, an ordinance was passed at City Council on February 27&nbsp;to increase land use fees effective April 1, 2019. Changes to other fees would go to City Council later this spring, with an effective date of July 1, 2019.</li>
<li>Our budget includes a request for $1.2 million in one-time General Fund support for Land Use Services (see below for details).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Budget Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Our budget includes two Budget Directives from Mayor Wheeler that help address the Land Use Services Division funding issues and the need for better coordination and collaboration between the City bureaus involved in development review.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Land Use Services General Fund ($1.2 million)</span></p>
<p>The BDS Land Use Services (LUS) Division provides services that benefit the entire community through enforcement of the City&rsquo;s zoning regulations. State law prohibits us from using permit revenues to support local code enforcement programs like LUS. In the past the program was funded by a combination of its own fee revenues and the City&rsquo;s General Fund. However, in recent years General Fund support has been removed, and LUS is now funded entirely from LUS fee revenue, which has been decreasing steadily since FY 2017-18. There have been fewer applications for large commercial projects, which typically fund much of the program. Fee revenue has dropped more drastically than workload levels, including the portion of the workload that does not generate any direct fees for service, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reviewing code amendment projects for the Bureau of Planning and Sustainability;</li>
<li>Working on process improvements with the Portland Online Permitting System (POPS) and BDS Sign Program;</li>
<li>Improving the land use review customer experience by providing outreach and training to land use customers on preparing land use applications; and</li>
<li>Providing public information regarding the land use and permitting processes, through printed materials, the BDS website, videos, and answering questions in the permit center.</li>
</ul>
<p>If approved, this budget directive will provide much-needed funds and will allow LUS to continue to provide these important services.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">City Development Review Strategic Plan ($60,000)</span></p>
<p>This directive requests one-time General Fund support for a strategic planning process for the City&rsquo;s development review function.&nbsp; Development review in Portland is complex, involving up to seven different City bureaus applying City, State, and federal regulations.&nbsp; Coordination of the development review process is made more challenging by the lack of a shared set of values and goals and a governance structure for setting development review priorities and making decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If approved, this directive will involve all the development review bureaus in a process to identify shared goals and create a structure and process for prioritizing and making decisions.&nbsp; This will lead to better coordination between the bureaus and faster resolution of conflicts and differences, improving the City&rsquo;s development review function.</p>
<p>These directives received nearly unanimous support from the Development Review Advisory Committee (DRAC) and the BDS Budget Advisory Committee.</p>

The division processes permits and land use reviews required to demonstrate compliance with the Portland Zoning Code, Tree Code and Sign Code regulations.</p>
<p>Fee increases are roughly 5% overall, but some land use review fees will increase more substantially while others will remain the same. BDS also proposed a 5% increase to most site development fees on land use reviews and three Life Safety reviews on land use reviews will be removed. The need for the LUS fee increase stems from LUS division cost increases that have occurred over the past five years so that fees charged are closer to the costs of providing services, and the need to maintain adequate division financial reserves. The fee increase will take effect on April 1, 2019.

When complete, it will make permitting services more accessible to the community and increase the efficiency of the process for all customers.</p>
<p>The first major project to roll out in 2019 was PDX ePlans, the City&rsquo;s new electronic plan review system. PDX ePlans is now being used for all process managed commercial projects. The first permit to be issued through PDX ePlans was for the <a href=""https://www.mwaarchitects.com/work/argyle-street-apartments/"">Argyle Street Apartments</a>, an affordable housing development in the North Portland&rsquo;s Kenton Neighborhood. When complete, the Argyle Street Apartments will add 189 affordable housing units with mixed-use retail and office spaces.</p>
<p>According to the project team who worked on this project, reviews were more accurate, cutting the permitting time in half. Angie Tomlinson, the PDX ePlans team lead, notes how applicants appreciate the ease of &ldquo;pushing a button&rdquo; and plans are simply uploaded. She also explains how the review process is faster because reviewers work at the same time instead of waiting for a set of paper plans to be delivered to each reviewer. &ldquo;Our reviewers can do their work simultaneously, and their comments are available in real-time. This ensures transparency, accuracy and collaboration, all in a shorter time frame,&rdquo; says Angie.</p>
<p>Customers also appreciate the great improvements that PDX ePlans offers. &ldquo;It was fantastic to work through our first online permit with BDS,&rdquo; says Diana Moosman, Architect at MWA Architects, Inc., architect of record for the Argyle Street Apartments. &ldquo;It was daunting at first, but much better than switching out large sheets of paper over multiple trips to the City. The transition was smooth for our office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on the initial results of using PDX ePlans, the Bureau of Development Services is now fine tuning the process for applicants and staff. Soon, using PDX ePlans will become an option for all commercial projects, not just those that are process managed. After that, the team will begin working on residential permitting using PDX ePlans.</p>

Plans Examiner - June Issue,730072,Encouraging Inclusive Design for All,3,,2019-06-20 15:20:31 UTC,2019-04-29 20:50:00 UTC,A,Harperâ€™s Playground: a non-profit organization dedicated to designing and building inclusive playgrounds in Portland and beyond.,"<p>Cody Goldberg, Executive Director of <a href=""https://www.harpersplayground.org/get-involved/support/"">Harper's Playground</a>, visited the Bureau of Development Services as a guest speaker in November 2018, where he asked City staff to reflect on their influence in <strong>building more inclusive communities</strong>. The BDS Communications Team met up with Cody at the Harper&rsquo;s Playground headquarters (housed in the Gerding Edlen Development offices downtown) to talk further about his goals, his beliefs and the future of inclusive design.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Flashback to 2009:</strong> Cody Goldberg and his wife, April, took their daughter Harper to Arbor Lodge Park to play. Harper uses a walker&mdash;she was born with Emanuel Syndrome, a rare disorder that can make those who have it unable to walk or talk. Harper approached the play structure at Arbor Lodge Park, but her walker got stuck in the woodchips. An otherwise normal day at the park sent Cody and April on a mission to redesign and rebuild that playground and sparked a passion that has had a worldwide impact.</p>
<div>
<p>Today, Cody is the Executive Director of Harper&rsquo;s Playground, a non-profit organization dedicated to designing and building inclusive playgrounds in Portland and beyond. They&rsquo;ve rebuilt five playgrounds in the Pacific Northwest and have consulted on inclusive park designs around the world. Harper&rsquo;s Playground shares a model to create playgrounds that work for everyone&mdash;they&rsquo;ve found by making things more accessible for people who experience disability, it makes those elements more accessible to all visitors. &ldquo;Harper&rsquo;s Playground is the curb cut effect in motion,&rdquo; Cody says.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""content-left"" style=""font-size: 1.1em;"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=713545"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""600"" /></p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, community is everything. Our work is all about creating community: community benefit through community involvement. Healthy community means inclusive, playful community. These things are paramount.</p>
<p>Everybody could be a little more thoughtful about people who might have a harder time navigating a space or using something. <strong>We have to make accessible design the norm, not the exception.</strong> Designing for people who use wheels is ultimately the best way to get there. From my experience, it&rsquo;s how I was able to go from skateboard shoe marketing to a leader in this concept. But all I do is think, &lsquo;How will someone in wheels interact with this? How will people in wheels access this?&rsquo; There are often little tweaks in the design that cost nothing and make things better for a lot of people. It doesn&rsquo;t require a high paying consultant&mdash;just give the design a wheels test! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that <strong>there is a chasm between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law</strong>. When people are following the letter of the law too stringently, they&rsquo;re losing sight of the spirit of the law. That&rsquo;s why playground design has gotten worse and worse over the years, intending to follow the ADA laws but losing sight of why the laws exist in the first place.</p>
<p>What needs to change is the mindset that there has to be a trade-off when creating radically inclusive designs. There are people stuck in a mindset that radical inclusion means you must lose out on other things. We can take care of everyone and nobody has to lose out. <strong>So many people who hold power feel that allowing other people power means you must give something up. But true power means sharing your influence</strong>. It&rsquo;s difficult to get people to admit that typically developing children do not lose out when they&rsquo;re playing at accessible areas.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we need new policy. I have read the ADA requirements for playgrounds, and I am confident that we could create a much simpler set of guidelines that would make it easier to design playgrounds. We should simplify policy to be user friendly, both the policy itself and the resulting developments. I have such faith in human beings to do the right thing, but it literally takes questioning how things are done: is this the right way to do it? Who gets to be here? Who is invited to be in this space?</p>
<p><strong>Diversity in decision-making groups is important, but diversity of thought is as important as anything.</strong>&nbsp;I have worked with people who use wheels in decision-making capacities who are compromised by how hard they can push, because their job is to keep moving things forward. I don&rsquo;t believe that anyone&rsquo;s ability or background qualifies them to be the best advocate necessarily.</p>
<p>Until someone knows something, they don&rsquo;t know it. I didn&rsquo;t know about the importance of inclusion, and just because I do now, I can&rsquo;t forget that once I did not. We are not tolerant of people who know better and make choices that exclude people with disabilities, but we are tolerant of the experience of figuring this out. My wife, April, is really good at being humble and appreciative of people who come to the knowledge without having their own personal experience with it.</p>
<p>We came to this realization after our daughter faced this challenge. For other people to get it without going through it personally takes a lot of empathy. We are very thoughtful about the usefulness of our spaces for people who don&rsquo;t experience disabilities as well. Harper&rsquo;s Playground wouldn&rsquo;t be the success that it is if it was our spaces were not fun for kids who don&rsquo;t experience disabilities&hellip;that&rsquo;s not inclusive. Inclusion is making it fun for everyone. We just make sure that friends in wheels can be there too, and to feel connected.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Fees are evaluated during the annual budget development process to determine whether charges are sufficient to cover the costs of providing services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, BDS brought fee change proposals to Council to increase Land Use Services fees effective April 1, 2019, and changes to the rest of the bureau&rsquo;s programs effective July 1, 2019.&nbsp; City Council voted to approve the proposed fee changes intended to help the bureau better cover service delivery costs.&nbsp;<strong>The adopted fee schedules are now posted on the <a href=""/bds/79065"">BDS website</a>.&nbsp;</strong>In the process of evaluating the BDS fee change proposal, Council also decided to amend the FY 2019-20 budget, awarding Land Use Services $70,000 in General Fund resources in exchange for holding the fees charged for the Historic Resource Review below cost recovery.</p>
<p>BDS has not brought fee increases to Council in several years. Since 1988, construction-related programs operated by BDS (approximately 90% of bureau functions) have been primarily self-supporting. For the last five years, most BDS fees have remained unchanged, and some have even decreased; however, BDS personnel costs have grown substantially over the last few years, both from staff additions (to address historically high workloads) and from inflation. As a result, some bureau programs are now underfunded. BDS has employed a number of cost-saving measures, but fee increases are necessary in FY 2019-20 in order to maintain BDS&rsquo;s financial health. BDS will continue to monitor changes in development activity, workload and service delivery, revenues, and expenditures in each program, and take proactive steps to maintain appropriate balance between bureau operations, service delivery, and fiscal stability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BDS is&nbsp;<strong>dependent on fees for 98% of its revenues</strong>, and there are restrictions on transferring funds between programs. Fees are therefore evaluated on a program by program basis.&nbsp; Overall, fees are increasing approximately 5% in most cases; however, some fees are increasing by more and others are not changing at all. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about the bureau&rsquo;s finances, you can find budget information and links to the BDS budget and financial planning documents on the&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/53730"">BDS website</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that Multnomah County contracts with the City of Portland for inspection and plan review services in the unincorporated areas within the Portland urban services boundary, and fees associated with those services are also proposed to change. The proposed Unincorporated Multnomah County fee schedules are posted online&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/79065"">here</a>.

<p>The Residential Infill Project was presented to City Council in early September as part of a broader Housing Opportunities Initiative (HOI), which includes the Better Housing by Design project&nbsp;(an update to multi-dwelling zones)&nbsp;and a new Anti-Displacement Action Plan effort.</p>
<p>Residential Infill Project staff are analyzing two recently passed state bills to determine their effect on the Planning and Sustainability Commission&rsquo;s Recommended Draft. HB2001 requires cities to allow for certain types of middle housing (duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes and cottage clusters) in single-dwelling zones. SB534 requires cities to allow houses on historically platted lots, subject to certain limits relating to infrastructure, natural resources, and land hazards. Staff will present the results of their research at the HOI briefing. They will also be presenting an initial framework for the Anti-Displacement Action Plan.</p>
<p>After the HOI work session, Council will begin moving Better Housing by Design forward, with a public hearing this fall. The Residential Infill Project will follow, with a vote expected in early 2020.</p>

<p>The City of Portland <em>Stormwater Management Manual</em> (SWMM) is being updated. The SWMM enables the City to comply with regulatory requirements and protect both watershed resources and infrastructure investments with every development or improvement to achieve important citywide goals. The SWMM applies to development activities that construct or alter impervious area, as well as to those that could impact a drainageway. It applies to both work in the right-of-way and on private property. Significant technical updates include: clarifications to applicability and exemptions, clarification of the stormwater discharge hierarchy, revisions to hydrologic and hydraulic calculations and guidance, updated design detail drawings, changes to soil specifications and better alignment with the City&rsquo;s Sewer and Drainage Facilities Design Manual.</p>
<p>Environmental Services is inviting the public to review and comment. The public comment period is planned for October 2019. During that time material will be available here:&nbsp;<a href=""/bes/2020SWMM""><strong>www.portlandoregon.gov/bes/2020SWMM</strong><br /><br /></a></p>

<p>The current edition of the BES <em>Sewer and Drainage Facilities Design Manual </em>is more than 10 years old.&nbsp; Since its publication in 2007, construction technology, pipe materials, and project planning and design methodologies have evolved.&nbsp; Importantly too, the expectations of manual users have changed regarding the availability of information online.&nbsp; As a result, Environmental Services is proposing updates to the manual that will improve clarity, formalize and update technical requirements, eliminate obsolete information, and remove any discrepancies between the SDFDM and the City&rsquo;s Stormwater Management Manual (SWMM).

Plans Examiner - September Issue,740091,Neighborhood Contact Code Project,3,,2019-09-26 18:18:54 UTC,2019-08-19 18:20:00 UTC,A,"The intent of the Neighborhood Contact requirement is to provide an informal sharing opportunity between the applicant or representative of a development proposal and the people who live, work and pass by the site on a regular basis - to better allow neighbors to give constructive feedback about certain development proposals.","<p><img class=""content-right"" src=""/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=741009"" alt=""Fenced off construction site with person on moped riding by."" width=""340"" height=""360.4"" /></p>
<p>Neighborhood contact requirements were first introduced in Portland with the Albina Community Plan in 1993. Since then they've been expanded and applied to more areas of Portland. The intent of the Neighborhood Contact requirement is to provide an information sharing opportunity between the applicant or representative of a development proposal and the people who live, work and pass by the site on a regular basis - to better allow neighbors to give constructive feedback about certain development proposals.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Portland City Council adopted the Neighborhood Contact Code Update Project so that neighborhood contact requirements would be applied more consistently across Portland. The new Neighborhood Contact requirements result in some projects notifying of potential development with a sign on site and notice, with larger projects also holding an informational meeting.</p>
<p>The primary changes to Neighborhood Contact requirements involve:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Delivery method</strong> - Now applicants can use email or standard mail to notify neighborhood associations, district neighborhood coalitions, business associations, and sometimes school districts, of an upcoming building permit or land use review application.</li>
<li><strong>Burden of Responsibility</strong> - The current version places responsibility on the neighborhood association to host a meeting. The new version places responsibility on the applicant when an informational meeting is required.</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong> - There is a new requirement that applicants install a sign or signs on a property notifying neighbors of an upcoming development proposal before an application is submitted to the City. The Bureau of Development Services also has a new online tool for those want to know about larger development proposals ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Neighborhood Contact requirements go into effect on December 2, 2019, but because these requirements must be completed before a building permit or land use review is submitted, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">new requirements may be applicable to projects now.</span></p>
<p><strong>Building permit or land use review applications requiring Neighborhood Contact that are submitted on or after December 2, 2019 will not be accepted without required documentation showing the new requirements have been followed.</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Development Services (BDS) is working on tools to make the new Neighborhood Contact requirements easier and more understandable to follow. This includes:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>A Zoning Code Information Guide that explains the requirement and where it applies in more detail;</li>
<li>A <strong><a href=""/bds/49163"" target=""_blank"">Neighborhood Resources</a></strong> web page that provides information about the Neighborhood Contact requirement, how to stay informed and how to provide input on other development proposals;</li>
<li>A template notification sign in fillable .pdf, Illustrator, and InDesign and a new Administrative Rule providing details about requirements to properly sign a project. The templates will be posted online and ready for use by October 2, 2019.</li>
<li>Upcoming information online with instructions for developers to more easily follow the steps necessary to complete the new Neighborhood Contact requirements, including sample notifications and responses, and a form to certify compliance; and</li>
<li>A video announcing the new Neighborhood Contact requirements for customers in the Development Services Center and sent to applicants, developers, neighborhood associations, district neighborhood coalitions, business associations and school districts.</li>
</ul>
<p>For further information, visit the new <strong><a href=""/bds/49163"">Neighborhood Contact</a></strong> requirements page.</p>
<p>Submittal requirements to show compliance with the new requirements for building permit or land use review applications submitted on or after December 2, 2019 include the following:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li>Copy of the notification email or letter sent to the neighborhood association and other required organizations;</li>
<li>List of the email or postal addresses to which the notification was sent;</li>
<li>A photograph of the sign or signs posted on the site and describing the proposed development; and</li>

Permit applications sometimes require additional plan review activity because of revisions and/or changes in scope. When this occurs, permit applications are charged additional hourly plan review fees in accordance adopted BDS fee schedules. This policy applies to the following permit applications: Commercial (CO), Major Project Group (MG), Mechanical (MT), Residential (RS), Manufactured Home (MP &amp; MI), Zoning (ZP), Site Development (SD), and Development Review (DR). Further this policy applies to the following BDS plan reviews: Addressing, Planning &amp; Zoning, Erosion Control, Site Development, Life Safety, Energy, Structural and Mechanical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The intention of the Policy is to have consistency among BDS review groups on applying hourly fees in the following situations:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<li><strong>Non-value-added permit revisions</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; This applies to the initial plan review and subsequent review of check-sheet responses and corrections. The additional review fee will be calculated by multiplying the total plan review and processing time by the hourly rate in adopted BDS fee schedules.</li>
<li><strong>Permit application changes in scope of work&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; This applies to scope of work changes initiated by the applicant after the initial plan review is complete. This does not apply to changes made in response to plan review comments in order to comply with code requirements. The additional review fee will be calculated by multiplying the total plan review and processing time by the hourly rate in adopted BDS fee schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p>BDS Fee Schedules can be found&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/34184"">here</a>. The Policy Document will be posted to the website prior to the effective date.</p>

<p>Between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, there will be a phase-in period wherein permit applicants will have the option for submitting for permits using either the current (2014) OSSC or the new (2019) OSSC. Starting January 1, 2020 all permits must meet the requirements of OSSC 2019.</p>
<p>Customers submitting applications for a permit using the OSSC 2014 after October 1, 2019 must, at a minimum, complete the application intake process, including the completeness review and payment of intake fees,&nbsp;before close of business December 31, 2019&nbsp;in order to be vested under 2014 OSSC. To allow enough time for complete review of your application before December 31, 2019, the City recommends that you submit your application by December 16, 2019 to be vested under 2014 OSSC. The&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/37988"">Development Services Center</a>&nbsp;will be&nbsp;closed on December 31, 2019, so customers intending to submit applications or pay intake fees before January 1, 2020 should plan accordingly.</p>
<p>For information regarding minimum submittal requirements please&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/article/92699"">click here.</a></p>
<p>Projects utilizing Phased Permitting Process Management are required (at a minimum) to submit Foundation (FND) or Structural (STR) partial permits by December 31, 2019 to be vested under 2014 OSCC. An excavation and shoring (EXC) partial permit&nbsp;would not&nbsp;be sufficient to vest a building in the 2014 OSSC.&nbsp;<a href=""/bds/48350#cid_740729"">Please click here for minimum submittal requirements for process managed partial permits.</a></p>
<p>If a land use review is required for your project, you must substantially complete the land use review prior to being allowed to submit a permit application.</p>
<p>Updated requirements in OSSC 2019 may impact the design of structures and cost of construction. The impact of the new requirements is entirely dependent on the type of structure, the use and occupancy, and the location. Changes to 2014 OSSC are extensive and should be discussed with the appropriate design professionals before submitting any project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One notable change is that the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code will adopt the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.asce.org/structural-engineering/asce-7-and-sei-standards/"">ASCE 7-16 Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures</a>. Where the 2014 OSSC previously allowed 15% reduction in seismic forces for certain types of structures (when using Modal Response Spectrum Analysis per ASCE 7 12.9),&nbsp;the 2019 OSSC no longer permits the 15% reduction. This change will likely impact&nbsp;structures&nbsp;that require higher levels of structural lateral analysis (per ASCE 7 Table 12.6-1 for permitted analytical procedures), structures with structural irregularities (as defined by ASCE 7 Table 12.3-1 or Table 12.3-2) and/or structures greater than 160 feet tall.</p>
<p>Additionally, the design wind loading for structures has been reduced to considerable extent in certain areas and will likely result in less requirements, and lower costs, for structures whose lateral loads are governed by wind loads.</p>
<p>The State of Oregon Building Codes Structures Board plan to release code books in September 2019. Please contact the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.oregon.gov/bcd/Pages/index.aspx"">Building Codes Division</a>&nbsp;for more information and updates on the availability of the new codes.</p>
<p>Applicants should consult with their design teams to ensure that your project is in line with updated requirements of the 2019 Oregon Structural Specialty Code. Consult&nbsp;<a href=""https://codes.iccsafe.org/"">the International Code Council</a>&nbsp;for more information about changing codes and standards.</p>
