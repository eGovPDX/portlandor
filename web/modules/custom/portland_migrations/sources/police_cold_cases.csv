<p><strong>(No photo available)</strong></p>
<p>On December 17, 1989, the body of William (Bill) T. McReynolds was discovered in his one bedroom apartment at 230 NE 28<sup>th</sup>, #203 by Mark Rantovich.&nbsp; There was no sign of forced entry into the apartment and Mr Rantovich entered using a key previously supplied to him by Mr. McReynolds.&nbsp; Mr. McReynolds, a 74-year-old retired clergyman, was laying in his bed, bound, and had been stabbed to death when he was found.&nbsp; Investigators later determined that an ATM card and jewelry were missing from the apartment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acting on records from Mr. McReynolds' bank regarding the use of his ATM card, investigators contacted a subject who used his ATM card&nbsp; at 24<sup>th</sup> and Burnside on December 16, 1989.&nbsp; This person described two white males &nbsp;who had used a card just prior to him and again just after his use.&nbsp; One of these white males matched the description of Mr, Rantovich.&nbsp; The clothing description of this white male also matched the clothing that Mr, Rantovich told investigators&nbsp;he was wearing that night.&nbsp; Mr Rantovich became a person of interest in this homicide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark Steven Rantovich is a white male born August 4, 1963 and is 6', 160 lbs.&nbsp; He &nbsp;told investigators that he had no employment, was on probation at the time and that he survived by committing sexual acts for money.&nbsp; In January 2004, Mr. Rantovich died in Salt Lake City, Utah.&nbsp; Investigators would like to talk to any acquaintances of Mr. Rantovich&nbsp;about any statements he may have made about any incidents in Portland, any conversation about &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; or any conversations regarding the death of any of Mr. Rantovich&rsquo;s acquaintances.</p>

<p>On August 29<sup>,</sup> 1988, police responded to a welfare check at 2612 N. Holman, which was called in by the granddaughter of the occupants of that residence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police entered the residence where they discovered the bodies of Robert Wheatley, 61, and Frieda Wheatley, 69, in the basement.&nbsp; The medical examiner determined the cause of death as strangulation.&nbsp; Detectives believe that the Wheatley&rsquo;s died on August 27, 1988.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is apparent from the crime scene that the motive was robbery.&nbsp; There was no sign of forced entry.&nbsp; The home was ransacked and a television set, ATM &nbsp;card, credit card and the Wheatley&rsquo;s light green 1979 Buick Regal were stolen.&nbsp; The ATM and credit cards were used extensively in Northeast, North and Downtown Portland prior to the Wheatley&rsquo;s bodies being discovered.&nbsp; The Buick was recovered a few days later in a Jantzen Beach Shopping Center parking lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigating Detectives believe that there are people in the community that have information about this crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the morning of May 8, 1979, the manager of the apartments at 620 NE Brazee became concerned about the welfare of one of his tenants, Daisy W. Motley.&nbsp; Someone had made an anonymous phone call to him asking him to check on Ms. Motley because that person heard a disturbance coming from Ms. Motley&rsquo;s apartment.&nbsp; The manager tried to contact Ms. Motley, but she did not respond to phone calls or to knocks on the door.&nbsp; Using his pass key, the manager entered Ms. Motley&rsquo;s apartment and found her body.&nbsp; It was immediately apparent that she had been murdered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Motley was a 64-year-old, unemployed female who lived alone.&nbsp; She had no apparent enemies.&nbsp; The last time she was known to be alive was when she talked to her daughter at approximately 9 pm on May 7, 1979.&nbsp; Investigating Detectives believe that it is likely she knew her assailant.&nbsp; Robbery does not appear to be a motive.&nbsp; Ms. Motley was sexually assaulted.</p>

<p>On May 29, 1994, at approximately 4 a.m., Eddie Morgan was shot to death on the corner of NE 42<sup>nd</sup> and Alberta.&nbsp; A neighbor heard numerous gunshots and looked outside to see Eddie standing by the bus bench with both hands clutching the bench.&nbsp; The neighbor watched as one hand then the other let go of the bench and Eddie collapsed onto the sidewalk.&nbsp; Another neighbor rushed to help Eddie.&nbsp; This neighbor attempted CPR but gave up because it was apparent that Eddie was dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eddie was a 46-year-old white male who was mildly mentally challenged.&nbsp; He had been disabled from birth.&nbsp; He frequently walked around the neighborhood greeting people and often did it overnight and at odd hours.&nbsp; Area residents said that he was never violent and was deemed harmless by the neighbors.&nbsp; He had no record of drug or alcohol abuse and had no criminal history.&nbsp; He was affectionately known as the Mayor of 42<sup>nd</sup> Avenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no apparent motive for this murder.&nbsp; A dark-colored vehicle was seen leaving the area with more than one person inside shortly after the shooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators believe that numerous persons have knowledge of this crime but have not come forward.&nbsp; This case is particularly compelling because it seems apparent that Eddie Morgan did nothing that would have caused someone to kill him.&nbsp; Given his mental capacity and how he acted around everyone, it is likely that he only greeted the person who killed him and had not had any contact with that person before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On August 10, 2001, at approximately 4:20 am, a man who lived in the area of the 6500 block of SE 48<sup>th</sup> Ave was working on his computer when he heard what sounded like a gun shot.&nbsp; Shortly after that, he heard a scream and dogs barking.&nbsp; He then heard someone say ""call 911.""</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emergency medical personnel responded to the address of 6531 SE 48<sup>th</sup> Avenue.&nbsp; There, they found Joshua Michael Jeffries.&nbsp; Joshua died of the injuries he had received.&nbsp; An autopsy revealed that Joshua died of a single gun shot wound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joshua was an 11-year-old boy who attended Lewis Elementary School and had just completed 6<sup>th</sup> grade.&nbsp; He was 5 feet tall and weighed 110 lbs.&nbsp; He had no criminal record, there was no record of drug or alcohol use and no record of gang membership or activity.&nbsp; He had numerous friends that were mostly his own age and who lived near him.&nbsp; Investigators did not discover any feuds or violent disagreements that Joshua was engaged in with anyone and no threats had been made against Joshua by anyone.&nbsp; Family members described Joshua as a good kid who everyone loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon blood evidence at the scene, it is apparent that Joshua was in his bed when he was shot and very likely sleeping.&nbsp;There is no apparent motive for this heinous crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon further investigation, the officers discovered that the person in the driver&rsquo;s seat was secured there with the vehicle shoulder and lap belt.&nbsp; They could also see that this person was deceased.&nbsp; Homicide detectives were called and responded to the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homicide detectives also observed that the passenger door of the vehicle was open. They noted that the driver's side door window was shattered.&nbsp; The detectives were able to determine that the victim was Terrence Andre Norris, a 28-year-old African-American man.&nbsp; He was wearing a red hat, a dark blue coat, light blue sweatpants and tennis shoes.&nbsp; An autopsy determined that Mr. Norris died of multiple gunshot wounds most likely originating from the passenger seat area of the vehicle.</p>

<p>On July 25, 1993, at approximately 12:34 p.m., residents in the area of the 1400 block of SE Belmont heard gunshots.&nbsp; A neighbor left his apartment and went across the street to 1403 SE Belmont, a video rental store.&nbsp; On the sidewalk in front of the store, he found the owner, Thang Thi Nguyen, also known to neighbors as &ldquo;Lilly,&rdquo; lying on the sidewalk.&nbsp; She was bleeding and obviously seriously hurt.&nbsp; She said to the neighbor, &ldquo;They killed me, they killed me.&rdquo;&nbsp; 911 was called, medical personnel responded and transported Ms. Nguyen to the hospital, where she later died.&nbsp; An autopsy determined that Ms. Nguyen died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passing motorist that day notified police later that he saw two Asian males running from the area at about the time of the shooting.&nbsp; Another motorist had driven by the store earlier in the day and saw two young Asian males standing at the door of the video store.&nbsp; A white midsize vehicle may be associated with these two males.&nbsp; Based upon Ms. Nguyen&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;they&rdquo; killed me, investigators believe that it is likely that more than one person was involved in this shooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Nguyen was known to many in the area and described as &ldquo;the nicest person in the neighborhood&rdquo;.&nbsp; Her family told investigators that she was not the kind of person to resist if someone was trying to rob her.&nbsp; She would just give them the money. Investigators are unsure if robbery was a motive, but believe that Ms. Nguyen&rsquo;s purse may have been taken.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators determined that Mr. Hoyt was known to associate with methamphetamine users.&nbsp; He was last seen alive at the address of 9506 N.

<p>When emergency responders arrived, the woman had stopped breathing.&nbsp; She was transported to a local hospital where she was declared deceased.&nbsp; Identification recovered at the scene was used to identify this woman as Ruby Denise McLemore, a 21-year-old&nbsp;black female, who was &nbsp;5&rsquo;2&rdquo; and&nbsp;95 to 100 lbs.&nbsp; She was wearing a black beret, white pants, leg warmers, a black leather jacket, a sweatshirt and tennis shoes at the time of her death.&nbsp; A later autopsy determined that Ms. McLemore died of a single gunshot wound to the torso.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On February 12, 1989, an anonymous person called the Portland Police Bureau Crime Stoppers tip line.&nbsp; This person inquired about a reward, described the crime scene and victim and stated that they had witnessed this murder.&nbsp; As police pressed for details, this person said that they would call back the next day to talk to the primary investigator.&nbsp; They never called and remain anonymous to this day.</p>

<p>On December 16<sup>,</sup> 1976, 17-year old Sharon Ryan was making cookies at her sister&rsquo;s house in the 2400 block of NE Flanders.&nbsp; Sharon realized that there were no eggs at her sister&rsquo;s house and that she needed some for the cookie recipe.&nbsp; She told her sister that she was going to walk to a nearby store to buy eggs and would be right back.&nbsp; She never returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Sharon had not returned in about a half-hour, her sister became alarmed and began to search the neighborhood with her husband.&nbsp; After searching for approximately one-and-a-half hours, they called the police and made out a missing report on Sharon.&nbsp; Sharon&rsquo;s sister told the police that Sharon was a high school senior at Grant High School, was very reliable and had never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On December 18, 1976, friends and family of Sharon Ryan again searched the area and a friend found an egg carton and broken eggs in a parking lot near Sharon&rsquo;s home. Sharon&rsquo;s body was subsequently found in an isolated, grassy area next to the parking lot and had been partially covered with plant material. Portland Police responded to the scene and an autopsy revealed that Sharon had been sexually assaulted and died from homicidal violence.</p>

<p>On March 25, 1999, Central Precinct Officers were summoned to an apartment building in the 2100 block of NW Davis Street by the manager of the apartments.&nbsp; When the officers contacted the manager, he told them that there was a &ldquo;foul odor&rdquo; emanating from Apt #106.&nbsp; He also told them that Apt 106 was rented to a subject named Sven Gomez.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The manager let the officers into the apartment and as they searched, they discovered the partially decomposed body of a male.&nbsp; They were unable to determine at the time if it was the body of Sven Gomez.&nbsp; The person that was found in the apartment presented in such a manner that the officers immediately contacted Homicide Detectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homicide detectives responded, searched the scene and attended the autopsy of the found body.&nbsp; The autopsy revealed that the person died of asphyxiation.&nbsp; The body was identified as Sven Rodriguez Gomez.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of September 16, 1991, several residents in the area of SE 35<sup>th</sup> Ave/SE Salmon Street heard screams in the area of Sunnyside School at 3421 SE Salmon St. Calls were made to 911 and Portland Public School Police officers responded initially. There they found the custodian for the school, Robert T Duncan, deceased outside the school building near the flagpole. It was subsequently determined that Mr. Duncan died as a result of being stabbed. His wallet was missing from the scene and was later found several blocks away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A witness in the area reported to the police that he heard screams and then saw a subject running from the school grounds wearing dark clothing, including a jacket which was possibly blue. Other witnesses in the area reported to the police that they saw a heavy-set black female subject, approximately 25-28 years old, approximately 5&rsquo;3&rdquo; tall, wearing dark clothing, who threw away an object which was later determined to be Mr. Duncan&rsquo;s wallet. These witnesses saw the female subject walk onto the gas station lot at SE 39<sup>th</sup> Ave/SE Belmont Street. Another witness told police he saw an African-American female subject in her 40s on the service station lot. She was wearing a dark blue security guard type jacket with a fake fur collar. The jacket had an emblem on it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan had been employed by the Portland Public Schools for approximately 15 years and had worked as the custodian at Sunnyside School for several years. Mr. Duncan, who was 50 years old when he was killed, also cared for his disabled wife.</p>

<p>In 1999, Mark Jeffrey Dribin worked for United Airlines at PDX.&nbsp; On July 2, 1999, Mr. Dribin called his employer and requested the night off, as he had a &rdquo;personal emergency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Dribin has not been seen or heard from since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Dribin, &nbsp;a 42-year-old white male, 5&rsquo;6&rdquo;, 160 lbs with a shaved head, was a very responsible worker and not known to miss shifts or to disappear for any period of time.&nbsp; He was close to his parents and brother and has not contacted them since 1999.&nbsp; His family and friends do not believe that he simply left town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators went to Mr Dribin&rsquo;s residence.&nbsp; They found that numerous items were missing from the house and that Mr Dribin&rsquo;s vehicle had been taken.&nbsp; The vehicle was recovered approximatel;y 2 weeks later in an area that Mr. Dribin did not usually frequent.&nbsp; Based upon Mr Dribin&rsquo;s extended absence, his sterling work record and the lack of contact with his family, detectives were concerned for his safety.&nbsp; Further, investigators discovered physical evidence at the Dribin residence in the 3600 block of NE 137<sup>th</sup> Avenue&nbsp; that led them to believe that Mr Dribin is deceased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the early morning hours of June 5, 1983, a friend of Harold Penland&rsquo;s, who was known&nbsp; to everyone as Willy Nelson, came to Willy&rsquo;s residence .&nbsp; This friend found the screen door shut, but the interior door open.&nbsp; After knocking repeatedly, honking his car horn and trying to contact Willy on the phone, this friend entered the home&nbsp; He found Willy and his wife, Laura Penland, shot to death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willy&rsquo;s neighbors told police that he would have many visitors throughout the day and night that would stay for a short period of time.&nbsp; Willy&rsquo;s house was fortified; it had bars on the windows and doors.&nbsp; There was no sign of forced entry into the house.&nbsp; Given that Willy was security conscious, it is possible that he allowed entry to his residence to someone that he knew.&nbsp; Robbery may have been a motive for the perpetrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators believe that numerous people have information about these homicides that could result in a break in the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On September 7, 1988, while walking across the Hawthorne Bridge, a young woman smelled something decomposing.&nbsp; She looked down off the bridge and observed what she thought to be the arm of a person below, beneath the south edge of the SE Water Ave on/off ramp at the east end of the Hawthorne Bridge.&nbsp; The police were contacted and discovered the partially decomposed body of a male, who was later identified as Lenoed Joseph Santiago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lenoed Joseph Santiago, a 49-year-old gay Hispanic male, was 5&rsquo;6:, 136 lbs, and was a sailor and civilian employee of the US Navy.&nbsp; He was assigned to the ship, the USNS Andrew J. Higgens, which was in dry dock on Swan Island.&nbsp; He was last seen alive by his shipmates leaving the ship on August 16, 1988.&nbsp; At that time, he was supposedly carrying a considerable amount of cash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An autopsy determined that Mr. Santiago died of a severe beating.&nbsp; Numerous bones in his body were broken and there was a significant amount of blood spatter where Mr. Santiago&rsquo;s body was recovered.&nbsp; There was no cash on his person when the body was discovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A person of interest at the time, Matthew Delbert Loehr, was interviewed by investigators, admitted knowing Mr. Santiago, but denied complicity in his death.&nbsp; According to relatives of Mr. Loehr, Mr. Loehr did come into some unexplained money around the time Mr. Santiago could have been killed.&nbsp; Mr. Loehr has since died as a result of a drug overdose.&nbsp; Investigators would like to talk to acquaintances of Mr. Loehr to determine if he ever said anything to anyone about Mr. Santiago, Mr. Santiago&rsquo;s death or the death or beating of anyone.</p>

<p>On July 3, 1970, a Broadway Cab driver saw Leroy David Flisram at about 6 a.m. with his face covered in blood, walk to a parked vehicle, get in the vehicle and then collapse on the front seat. The cab driver could tell Mr. Flisram was seriously injured and he called the police. Mr. Flisram was transported toMultnomahCountyHospital(now OHSU) where he died from his injuries on July 8, 1970.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police were able to determine the vehicle, a blue, 1960 2-door Mercury, belonged to Mr. Flisram. It was parked in the area of SW Salmon Street/SW 2<sup>nd</sup>-SW3rd Avenue when the cab driver saw Mr. Flisram get into it. From the police investigation, it appears that Mr. Flisram was attacked, beaten and robbed, and had wandered disoriented in the downtown area before returning to his vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Flisram was a 48-year-old white male, 6&rsquo;2&rdquo;-6&rsquo;3&rdquo; tall, weighing 220-240 lbs. According to his son, he was discharged from the Army because of complications from a previous injury he sustained while working as a logger. He was also blind in one eye from an industrial accident. He was also reported to have been a police officer in Tillamook. Although he had alcohol problems for many years, the last months of his life he had worked to get other alcoholics into AA.</p>

<p>On January 1, 2007, at approximately 2 a.m., a group of people were standing on the corner of SW 4<sup>th</sup> Avenue and Stark Street when a vehicle drove by northbound on Stark Street.&nbsp; This vehicle was variously described as a light-colored or dark-colored vehicle.&nbsp; The most likely description is a vehicle that was dark in color and a luxury type car, perhaps an Acura, Mercedes or something similar.&nbsp; The vehicle was a 4-door with tinted windows and a round emblem on the trunk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the witnesses generally agree that a white male in the right rear passenger seat was yelling at the subjects on the sidewalk.&nbsp; The vehicle stopped at the red light at SW Stark Street, whereupon Jermaine Davis and two other subjects approached the open right rear window of the vehicle to confront the passenger.&nbsp; A physical confrontation occurred with one or more of the subjects punching through the window at which point a shot rang out, apparently coming from within the vehicle.&nbsp; The vehicle fled eastbound on Stark and Mr. Davis and his companions fled south on the east sidewalk of SW 4<sup>th</sup> Avenue.&nbsp; Mr. Davis reached the sidewalk, collapsed and died just north of the City Sports Bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jermaine Niron Davis was a 24-year-old African-American male, 5&rsquo;8&rdquo;, 160 Lbs.&nbsp; He was known to frequent the downtown area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best suspect description is a white or Hispanic male, with a mustache, goatee and dark brown hair.</p>

<p>On December 21, 1981, Kevin Thomas and his mother were concerned about the welfare of his sister, Karen Andrea Thomas.&nbsp; Ms. Thomas had not had any contact with her family since leaving their residence on December 18<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; This was very unusual.&nbsp; Karen had been staying in an apartment in the 4900 block of NE 7<sup>th</sup> until she moved back with her mother and step-father in mid-December.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensing something was wrong, Kevin went to Karen&rsquo;s old apartment.&nbsp; With the landlord assisting, he was able to enter the apartment where he found Karen&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; She had been stabbed to death.&nbsp; Detectives interviewed Karen&rsquo;s family and a number of Karen&rsquo;s friends and acquaintances.&nbsp; They learned that she had a three-year-old son and had changed her lifestyle since his birth.&nbsp; At the time, Detectives were unable to develop any suspects in her death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sixteen years after Ms Thomas&rsquo; death, a subject contacted Detectives with information regarding that death.&nbsp; As a result of this information, a person named Johnny Moore, an African-American male born in 1948, became a person of interest in this homicide.&nbsp; Mr. Moore is now deceased, dying of an apparent drug overdose in 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators are looking for people who knew Johnny Moore and had conversation with him regarding statements he may have made about the death of Karen Thomas or the deaths of any females he may have been associated with.&nbsp;Any information of this sort would assist in closure for Karen Thomas&rsquo; family.</p>

<p>On April 10, 1999, the body of Karl Everett Kneedler was discovered at 2228 NE Alberta Street.&nbsp; Mr. Kneedler stayed in a makeshift apartment in that building, but its main purpose was the Clubhouse for the Brothers Free Motorcycle Club and a repair facility for motorcycles.&nbsp; Mr, Kneedler&rsquo;s body was discovered by Walter Holland, a part owner of the building.&nbsp; Mr Kneedler&rsquo;s body was on the floor of his apartment, and he had died of gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier that same week, the body of Laurie Larson was found in Mr. Kneedler&rsquo;s apartment.&nbsp; Mr Kneedler had called the police and told them that Ms. Larson had come to his shop, and asked to lie down because she wasn&rsquo;t feeling well.&nbsp; He checked on her approximately 20 minutes later and found her not breathing and non-responsive.&nbsp; Emergency medical personnel responded and found Ms. Larson was deceased.&nbsp; An autopsy revealed that she died of a drug overdose.&nbsp; It is unknown if these two deaths are related.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investigators were able to determine that Mr Kneedler was last seen alive on April 9,1999, &nbsp;in the early evening hours accompanied by a man named &ldquo;John.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;John has never been identified and investigators would like to speak to him about any information he might have regarding Mr Kneedler&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>During the early morning hours of October 31, 1993, two suspects forcibly broke into an apartment in a complex located at 10576 SE Cherry Blossom Drive. The two suspects, who were both armed, confronted the apartment residents in the bedroom. The suspects, who both had their faces covered, were shouting that they were the police. During the confrontation with the victim, multiple shots were fired and Keith David Roby was shot and died at the apartment. Also present in the bedroom was the victim&rsquo;s girlfriend during the confrontation and firing of the gunshots. She was not injured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The suspects were described as white males, one approximately 30 years old, 6&rsquo;1&rdquo; with a medium build and the second one in his early 20&rsquo;s, 5&rsquo;8&rdquo; to 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; with short, dark blond hair. Their faces were covered with bandannas. The victim&rsquo;s girlfriend said she did not know why the suspects came into the apartment, but robbery may have been the motive for the home invasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith Roby&rsquo;s family feel that marijuana trafficking may have played a part in the home invasion and killing of their loved one.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of September 8, 1973, Roy Lee Jernigan went to the address of 527 N. Ivy Street to pick up his 2-and-a-half-year-old son.&nbsp; Upon his arrival, he approached the front door and entered.&nbsp; He immediately saw the body of a female who appeared to have been beaten.&nbsp; Mr. Jernigan began to search the house and in the bedroom, he discovered another body of a female who also appeared to have been beaten.&nbsp; This female was the mother of his child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuing his search, he found his son, alive and uninjured.&nbsp; Police officers responded, took control of the scene and determined that both females were deceased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

He asked the neighbors to call 911 and the Fire Bureau responded. Inside the residence, firemen discovered the body of Grace Turel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grace Turel was a 77-year-old widow who lived alone; her husband died two years before. According to neighbors, Grace Turel was security conscious and normally kept her doors locked and would not open her door to strangers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grace Turel did not die easy. She was assaulted prior to the arson fire at her residence. Based on evidence recovered at the crime scene, robbery does not appear to be a motive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 2, 1996, a recreational snorkel diver was diving in the Washougal River approximately 100 feet downstream from the Dougan Falls Bridge in Skamania County, Washington.&nbsp; He noticed something shiny on the bottom of a pool and dove to investigate.&nbsp; As he dove closer he saw a hand and arm.&nbsp; He immediately went to the surface and called 911.&nbsp; Skamania Co Sheriffs office responded, called a dive team and determined that there was a body of a white female on the river bottom fully clothed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The body was subsequently recovered, an autopsy was performed and the cause of death was trauma, not drowning.&nbsp; Using dental records, this body was then identified as that of Angela Krueger.&nbsp; Ms Krueger had no contact with anyone after May 11, 1996, either in person or via phone or pager.&nbsp; This was unusual as Ms Krueger was said by her family to always respond to her pager.&nbsp; Investigators believe that Ms. Krueger was likely killed on May 11<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; Based upon the remoteness of the location where Angela Krueger&rsquo;s body was found, it is also likely that Ms Krueger&rsquo;s killer or killers were familiar with the area of Dougan Falls and the Washougal River.</p>

<p>On June 12, 1991, a female office employee of Western School Supply, located 5800 NE Hassalo Street, arrived at work at approximately 7:30 am.&nbsp; Shortly after that, she went into the warehouse portion of the business and as she was walking down an aisle, she saw the body of her co-worker, Dewayne Ruschman.&nbsp; She called out to ask someone to call 911.&nbsp; Police responded and homicide detectives were called.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives observed that the area where Mr. Ruschman&rsquo;s body was found displayed obvious signs of a struggle.&nbsp; They were able to determine that the night before Mr. Ruschman&rsquo;s body was discovered he received a phone call at his home at approximately 10 p.m. and told his wife that he had to go back to work.&nbsp; This was not unusual for him as he was described by his wife and co-workers as a workaholic who often worked long hours and/or returned to work at night.&nbsp; Mr. Ruschman was the manager of the warehouse and in that capacity, sold items from the warehouse to different customers, sometimes for cash.&nbsp; There was currently a sale to the general public going on at Western School Supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives noted that Mr. Ruschman&rsquo;s tri-fold brown wallet was missing.&nbsp; The wallet contained cash, identification to Mr. Ruschman and numerous credit cards.&nbsp; None of these items have ever been recovered.&nbsp; Mr Ruschman was also known to carry cash in his front shirt pocket.&nbsp; Detectives recovered no cash from any of Mr. Ruschman&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed that Mr Ruschman died of blunt force trauma.&nbsp; It was also obvious from the autopsy that Mr. Ruschman was involved in a struggle prior to his death.</p>

<p>On May 28, 1986, at approximately 2:30 p.m., a motorist driving northbound in the 600 block of NW 14<sup>th</sup> saw a person lying on the sidewalk on the east side of the street.&nbsp; Noticing blood near the body, the motorist went to a nearby business and asked them to call 911.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Emergency personnel responded and found that the person was deceased.&nbsp; Police were notified and upon their response they notified homicide detectives.&nbsp; Homicide detectives arrived and an investigation began.&nbsp; When an autopsy was performed, the cause of death was a gunshot wound.&nbsp; The victim was identified as 34-year-old Daniel L. McDaniel, a white male, &nbsp;who was 5&rsquo;6&rdquo;, 130 lbs. &nbsp;Mr McDaniel left behind a wife and three children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequent investigation revealed the name of Federico Vicente Cordova, who was 32 years old in 1986, and went by the name of &ldquo;Chico.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Cordova is now deceased.

<p>On September 26, 1996, at approximately 10:30 p.m. at 13945 SE Division, Alvin Bradshaw was shot while lying in his bed.&nbsp; He survived the initial assault, but later died at the hospital. Mr. Bradshaw was 48 years old and bedridden most of the time due to several medical conditions.&nbsp; He was not employed and it is believed he sold drugs from his apartment to support himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of the shooting, there were several people in the apartment who gave very similar accounts of the incident. &nbsp;Two suspects that disguised themselves by wearing panty hose over their heads entered the apartment and demanded money from the victim. Shots were fired and the suspects fled the scene.&nbsp; The suspects were described as #1) male, white, in his 40&rsquo;s (in 1996), 5&rsquo;9, 160 lbs. grayish collar length hair, black/gray ski type jacket, jeans, running shoes, and gloves with an automatic pistol in his rights hand.&nbsp; #2) male, white, 40- 50 yrs old (in 1996), 5&rsquo;9, 175-180 lbs. longer gray or brown hair, balding &nbsp;on top, full beard and mustache, blue eyes, dark ski jacket, pistol in left hand. &nbsp;</p>

<p>On January 6, 1997, at approximately 7 pm, Sean Tahtinen went to his brother&rsquo;s apartment in the 106<sup>th</sup> block of NE Wygant to check on him. He had last talked to his brother, Dean Owen&nbsp;Tahtinen, on January 3, 1997, and was supposed to give Dean a ride to the airport on January 5. When he did not hear from Dean on January 5<sup>,</sup> he assumed that Dean had taken a cab to the airport. Dean worked for Wells Fargo Bank and was flying to Arizona as part of his employment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 6, Dean&rsquo;s supervisor from Wells Fargo Bank contacted Sean and inquired about Dean, as Dean had not arrived in Arizona and had missed work. This was very unusual for Dean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Sean opened Dean Tahtinen&rsquo;s apartment door, he found his brother dead.&nbsp; He then left the apartment and called the police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detectives were able to determine that the last time Dean Tahtinen was seen alive was on the evening of January 4, 1997 at approximately 7 pm. Dean was drinking at a bar called CC Slaughters. Dean was known to frequent that establishment. He was not seen leaving with anyone.</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed that he died of homicidal violence.</p>

<p>On September 6, 1982, two individuals were driving east on N Lombard Street at approximately 9:30 pm when they observed what appeared to be a man lying in the Chevron service station near the intersection of N Lombard and Wabash Avenue. When they approached, they discovered James Kesch, a 21-year-old white man who worked as the service station attendant, was shot on the floor of the service station. They called 911 from the service station phone and Mr. Kesch was transported to a nearby hospital where he died shortly after. Investigators believe this to be an attempted robbery, although no money was missing from either the register or safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James Kesch was known to be well liked with no criminal record. An unidentified African-American man was reported to be at the service station shortly after gunshots were reported. He has been described as being in his late teens to early twenties, 5 foot 8 inches to 5 foot 10 inches tall, medium build and medium complexion, wearing a dark baseball cap, dark or navy blue service station jacket with dark pants and shoulder length hair.</p>

<p>At approximately 2:45 in the afternoon on November 26, 1991, two men walked into Jamie&rsquo;s Place, a tavern on 1313 NE Fremont, looking to buy some peanuts. After finding that no one was present, the two men walked next door to call the police, since it was unusual that the owner, Jamie Brock, would not be present while the tavern was open during that time of the day. Police responded and found that Jamie Brock, a 57-year old African-American woman, had been shot and killed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brock was a well-known business owner in the area with no known enemies and no criminal record. She was last seen approximately 30 minutes before the police were called.</p>
