15,15,Columbia Childrens Arboretum,10040 NE 6th Drive,1999,27.17813782,1,97211,NE,,,"In 1900, the area along the Columbia River northeast of Portland was primarily farmland. It flooded every spring with heavy rainfall and melting mountain snows. In the dry summer and fall, water remained in shallow lakes and narrow sloughs. The land between the waterways formed great meadows surrounded by massive cottonwoods and other riparian plants.  John Charles Olmsted looked at this land with foresight. Although most considered it valueless for any other purpose than farming, he proposed acquiring a large acreage in the Columbia Slough region for future parkland. He wrote about the potential of this landscape as a contrast to the hills and river frontages in other parts of town to provide "". . . great stretches of meadow land bordered and diversified by groves of trees. No other form of park has ever proved so attractive and so useful to the masses of the people as the meadow park, particularly when there can be associated with it long reaches of still water as a landscape attraction and for boating purposes.""  Olmsted proposed that Columbia Slough Park would not only provide still waters for boaters unsure of the Willamette River's strong currents, but also broad meadows for recreation such as picnicking, strolling, fast driving, horse racing (as long as gambling could be prevented), and golfing if it should retain its popularity. He suggested that the City secure hundreds to several thousand acres while this land remained inexpensive because of its regular flooding and its great distance from city development.  The land Olmsted proposed for Columbia Slough Park surrounds Switzler’s Lake. Much of this land was farmed by a family named Delminico in the early 20th century. Along with other farmers in the area, they built the original levees between 1917-1919 to reduce yearly flooding from the river. By 1920, enough families had moved into the area that an educational facility was needed for the neighborhood children. Columbia School District #33 was organized and land was purchased for a grade school and high school along NE Sixth Ave. An elementary school was built on the property located at the corner of NE  Sixth and Marine Dr. The high school property one block west, which was never developed, is now the Columbia Children’s Arboretum. The Columbia School District was annexed by Faloma District #33 in 1935, then reorganized as Columbia District #33 again in 1944. Portland Public Schools finally annexed the land and school in 1964.  When Portland School District acquired Columbia School, it was designated as a middle school. The local youth who attended the school were primarily a very transient population, well below the city average in both education achievement and economic levels. In a goal to strengthen the basic curriculum through science-centered projects, Principal Bill Warner proposed a new program titled Growth through Research, Organization & Work (GROW). Students studied math, language arts, social studies, health, and science as they worked on the 28-acre site that became known as the Columbia Children’s Arboretum.  The land started out as a tangle of blackberries in 1965, but by 1970, students and families had planted 8,000 trees. Students began by planning three different scenarios for the development of the land. An orchard and organic garden was chosen for the area adjacent to NE Sixth Ave. An arboretum was designed for the land on the south side of the drainage ditch with intentions to solicit and plant trees from every U.S. state. The area furthest from Sixth Ave was planned as a natural area where indigenous plants and animals could provide a tranquil setting for study.  Before long, the creation of a garden and arboretum became a community project. Organizations of all sorts began to help the school create its dream. Edward Maddix, a Tigard architect provided construction drawings for the site. Students and staff approached the U.S. Marines for assistance with heavy land moving. Bulldozers were brought in to remove the blackberries and create a pond with an island. The Oregon Association of Nurserymen supplied trees, the Rose Society donated roses for the garden, the pond was stocked with fish by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the Rotary Club provided tree labels, and the list goes on. The architect worked with students to design a study shelter that was adopted by Women in Construction. Remnants of the beginning of the shelter still remain, although its construction was limited by the fact that utilities could not be brought to the site.  In 1977, Portland Public Schools built a bus barn on the site of the organic farm area. Eventually, changing demographics in northeast Portland reduced the need for Columbia Middle School, and it closed in 1983. Classes at Whitaker School, located three miles from the arboretum, adopted the GROW program in the 1980s and planting increased. However, the distance between the school and Arboretum became a problem and the program only lasted until the early 1990s. A few classrooms around the district continued to use the Arboretum for field trips. The most constant visitors were neighbors from the new housing developments on the east side of the Arboretum. The neighborhood association created a Columbia Children’s Arboretum Preservation Committee to develop goals and activities in the Arboretum. It has sponsored work parties on a monthly basis for over 10 years. In addition, the committee funded aspects of the East Columbia Wetlands Management Plan to include plans for the Arboretum site. The very first Natural Resources Management Plan in the city, it has guided development and promoted the environmental activities for the Arboretum and adjacent areas since 1988.  In 1999, Portland Parks & Recreation acquired the Columbia Children’s Arboretum land from Portland Public Schools for use as a park. Working closely with the community, a management plan for the site was developed in March 2004. <p>",,Columbia Children's Arboretum,,,,,45.593718,-122.659268

A major commitment to music education was made in the late 1950s when all existing music classes were moved to the Woodstock Community Center. Children's music classes were introduced, including music theory and ear-training, and a variety of stringed instruments were taught. As the children's abilities improved, a string ensemble was formed. It was evident that the music program would soon outgrow its new home.  Community Music Center, Inc. was founded as a non-profit association in February 1960 by a group of parents and interested citizens. It played a vital role in the remodeling a beautiful 1912 firehouse - designated a Portland Historic Landmark - which became the permanent home of CMC in 1969. That project was made possible by a generous gift from John D. and Elizabeth Gray and the donation of services by architect Robert Oringdulph. Substantial improvements were made to the facility in 1999, bringing the building up to the seismic requirements of the City of Portland, and making the building accessible in accordance with the American Disability Act. <p>",5038233177,Community Music Center,,CMCpdx,,,45.494552,-122.630532

His first home in Portland was near where Union Station is today, but he owned all the land from the river to approximately NW 23rd Avenue and from Burnside north for a mile. Captain Couch developed this land and named the blocks alphabetically (A Street, B Street, and so forth). During the last half of the 1800s, Couch's land was known as the Alphabet District. The captain was a well-liked, civic-minded man, so it's only appropriate that one of Portland's beautiful parks be named in his honor.  The site of today's Couch Park was once the estate of 19th century merchant prince Cicero Hunt Lewis, who married Captain Couch's daughter Clementine. The estate consisted of an elegant mansion, stables, and a greenhouse, all of which were built in 1881. The Lewises raised eleven children on these grounds.  After the Lewis house was demolished, the Portland School District acquired the property in 1913 and built a new Couch School to replace the first one built in 1882 located at NW 17th & Kearney. The block east of the school, now the park, was used as a playground.  In 1970 the Captain John Brown house (built in 1890 at 2035 NW Everett) was moved onto the northeast corner of the site to save it from demolition. Private citizens donated money to restore the building as a center for senior citizens and medical services. A HUD Historic Preservation Agency grant of $100,000 was insufficient to complete the restoration and when the additional funds couldn't be raised, the project was abandoned. By 1973 the house had been severely vandalized and was finally demolished.  Couch School became a special school in 1968 and in 1974 its name changed to the Metropolitan Learning Center (MLC), leaving only the park with Couch's name.  In 2014, the wooden play structure and stage at Couch Park was closed and removed after spending approximately 40 years exposed to the Oregon rain. While repairs were made as long as they could to the beloved park feature, the structure had deteriorated beyond repair.   Thanks to the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond passed by Portland voters and a partnership with Harper’s Playground and Friends of Couch Playground, a new inclusive playground, plaza, and Portland Loo was opened in May of 2019. The $500,000 raised by Harper’s Playground and the Friends of Couch Playground included a Nature in Neighborhoods grant from Metro.  <p>",,Couch Park,,,,,45.526705,-122.691572

Originally known as Talbot's Mountain after its pioneer settlers, it has also been known as Glass Hill and later as Fairmount, the name of the road that encircles it. According to legend, Council Crest got its name because it was here where Native Americans held meetings and built signal fires. According to McArthur's <I>Oregon Geographic Names</I>, however, it was named in 1898 by delegates to the National Council of Congregational Churches, who met on the top.  The water tower that now stands atop Council Crest used to be a 77-foot-tall wooden observatory, part of the Council Crest Amusement Park which operated from 1907-1929 and was torn down in 1941. From the top of the hill, one can see five mountains in the Cascade Range: Mt Hood, Mt St Helens, Mt Adams, Mt Jefferson, and Mt Rainier. In addition, the park boasts a fantastic 180-degree view of Portland and surrounding towns.  In July 1956, a welded, sheet bronze drinking fountain featuring a mother and child was installed in the park. Sculpted by Frederick Littman, an associate professor of art at Portland State College, it has been mistakenly identified as a pioneer woman. The sculptor said the statue did not represent a particular era; it was simply a mother and child playing in the park and depicts joy. The fountain was made possible by a $6,000 bequest to the city in 1949 from the estate of Florence Laberee, widow of local builder and contractor George P. Laberee.  In the 1980s, the statue was stolen in the middle of the night by vandals who used hacksaws to dismantle it from its base, sawing through the mother's ankles. Nearly 10 years later, during a narcotics raid on a home in northeast Portland, officers found the rusty statue in the backyard under a cover. The statue was re-erected in the center of the park near the entrance, as opposed to its original location on the eastern side of the park. <p>",,Council Crest Park,,,,,45.498857,-122.707985

Ladd, who served two terms as the mayor of Portland in the 1800s, was the original owner of the property. He called it Crystal Springs Farm. The oldest rhododendron in the current garden was planted prior to 1917.   The development of a display and test garden was initiated in 1950 by the Portland Chapter of the American Rhododendron Society. Sam Jackson, owner of the Oregon Journal, had donated 27 acres on Terwilliger Blvd for the garden, but the site was deemed unsuitable because of its steep terrain. Claude I. Sersanous, one of the group assigned to select a new site, suggested the garden's present location near Reed College. Referred to as Shakespeare Island by Reed College students because of the Shakespearean plays that had been performed there, it was abandoned and overgrown with brush and blackberries. Through the efforts of Portland Chapter members and other volunteers, and with the support of Park Superintendent C.P. Keyser, the garden flourished. The first rhododendron show was held in 1956, and the garden was officially named Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden in 1964.  Originally, the garden was developed as a test garden, which meant that new rhododendrons could be evaluated over a period of several years. Lack of security and adequate protection made this impractical and the concept was dropped. The original garden, on what is now called the Island, was designed by Ruth Hansen, a landscape architect and Portland Chapter member. The portion of the garden known as the Peninsula was designed by Wallace K. Huntington, a well-known Portland landscape architect, and was dedicated in 1977. The rocks used to build the waterfalls and other features were gathered from Mt Hood and Mt Adams.  The more than 2,500 rhododendrons, azaleas, and companion plants in the garden have all been donated by volunteers and interested individuals, or purchased with specially donated funds. Beginning in early spring and continuing into summer, they provide a magnificent display of color, giving visitors the opportunity to view many varieties rarely seen in the Pacific Northwest. During the fall, many companion trees add dramatic coloring. Spring-fed Crystal Springs Lake surrounds much of the garden, attracting many species of birds and waterfowl. <p>",5037718386,Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden,,CrystalSpringsRhododendronGardenPortland,,,45.478655,-122.636127

The park was the epicenter of many political and social movements during the next 30 years. Robert F. Kennedy spoke here. Civil rights marches began here.  The gazebo in the park was built in 1978 to showcase the 120 year-old cupola salvaged from the Hill Block Building, once a cornerstone of the old Albina commercial district and an informal gathering place for the African-American community. The onion-like dome was landmark architecture on the Hill Block Building located on the northwest corner of the intersection of N. Russell & Williams. The building and many others were torn down in the early 1970s to make room for a proposed expansion of the Emanuel Hospital campus. The expansion did not take place due to a cut in federal funds. The gazebo was renovated in 2008.  The summer of 2000 saw an increase of criminal activity in the park. A partnership was formed between the Portland Police Bureau, Portland Parks & Recreation, the Eliot Neighborhood Association, Legacy Emanuel Hospital, Immaculate Heart Church, neighbors, and local businesses to address the problem. This community effort resulted in a revitalization of the park, adding amenities like permanent checkers tables and promoting positive activities for all ages.  By 2007, the park had fallen into some disrepair and a Dawson Master Plan, developed with the community, envisioned restoring it as a key community gathering space. With funding secured in 2011, area residents, community organizations, and area churches provided input to Portland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) and Portland Development Commission (PDC) on how park improvements could promote better use, create a more inviting feel for families, and highlight the park’s deep cultural and historical roots. The final park design by landscape architects 2.ink Studio reflected all of these elements.   Construction began in October 2013, managed by PDC to allow flexibility to optimize minority-certified contractor utilization on the project. Primary funding for Dawson Park's redevelopment was provided from PDC’s Interstate Corridor Urban Renewal Area. Legacy Emanuel Medical Center, in partnership with the non-profit Portland Parks Foundation, donated generous funding toward the newly completed water feature. PP&R and Parks Commissioner Amanda Fritz, with advocacy from the Northeast Coalition of Neighbors (NECN) and the non-profit Harper's Playground, funded upgraded playground surfacing for universal accessibility. <p>",,Dawson Park,,,,,45.544195,-122.667442

Prior to its destruction, Vanport was the second largest city in Oregon. Vanport was constructed in order to house the thousands of war-time shipbuilders that Henry Kaiser, of Henry Kaiser Industries, had recruited from New York to help with the war effort. Vanport, which was constructed in under a year, was deemed 'The Miracle City.' It had its own post office, nine schools, a fire station, a 400-seat cafeteria, a 785-seat theater, a library, a hospital, fourteen playgrounds, five commercial centers, and a police station staffed by twenty-two officers.  The problem with this instant city was that the quality of housing and building construction left much to be desired. On Sunday, May 30, 1948, just one day after the general manager of Vanport announced that the city was ""not in any foreseeable danger"" from rising flood waters, a segment of the ring-like dike surrounding the city collapsed. A 12-foot wall of water rushed through the community, wiping out all of the poorly-constructed houses. The residents were never officially notified that they were in danger.  Delta Park has been the site of quite a bit of controversy over the years. In 1964 there were some hotly contested plans to build a domed stadium in the park. Had the plans gone through, the stadium would have been the largest of its kind, with permanent seating for 60,000 and temporary seating up to 80,000. The plans were not approved and we now have a place for all sorts of outdoor activities. <p>",,Delta Park,,,,,45.598735,-122.680252

After retiring in 1970, he served as a medical consultant for the state workmen’s compensation board until 1976.   He won several awards for his work against racial discrimination as well as for his public service work. In 1958, the Oregon Medical Society named him Doctor of the Year. For his role in bringing down racial barriers, the city of Portland named this park in his honor in 1969. Unthank was the recipient of the distinguished citizenship award from the University of Oregon in 1971 and the citizenship award from Concordia College in 1975. Unthank was the first African American member of the Portland City Club.

The majority of lilacs in the garden were grown by B.O. Case, a nurseryman from southeastern Washington. When Case died in 1936, the Portland Garden Club decided to make his collection a gift to the City of Portland. Mrs. Mark M.

He was born in 1814, in Pulaski County, Kentucky. In 1848, Albert and three of his brothers set out for Oregon. He and brother Clinton got as far as Independence, Missouri, when Albert's livestock were scattered by a storm and lost. Clinton kept on going, but Albert turned back and delayed coming west until the following year  Albert first scouted the area now known as Holladay Park, but was discouraged by the lack of a reliable supply of water. Later, he and  Finice Caruthers explored the area west of the hills, and found it much more to his liking. Albert made his land claim and in 1850, he and his sons put up a cabin of logs and shakes, and moved into it just in time for the birth of his daughter Martha (later, Mrs. O.P.S. Plummer). Albert and his family farmed the land, and Albert served his church as a circuit-riding minister until his death in 1873.  The park came into being in 1956 when Mrs. Hildegarde Plummer Withers offered 9 acres of the family land to then Parks Superintendent Buckley - if it would be dedicated as a park and named after her grandfather, Albert Kelly. The offer was accepted, and for $25,000, the city of Portland took title to the land. Through a series of land swaps and changes in 1959, 1963 and 1965, the park was somewhat reshaped and enlarged to its present size of 12.8 acres.",,Albert Kelly Park,,,,,45.486013,-122.71387

The first true public space in the Skidmore-Old Town District, it is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built on vacated Vine St. and Block 35 on the site of the Bank of British Columbia.  The Plaza was updated in the mid-1980s when TriMet's light rail system (MAX) was slated to travel through the area. PP&R was careful to keep the restoration sensitive to its historical backdrop. Donations of original wrought iron and other historic building materials were used in order to restore Ankeny Plaza to its former glory.  The Skidmore Fountain is Portland's oldest piece of public art and has been praised as one of the finest fountains in American art. Stephen G. Skidmore, a druggist who arrived in Portland by covered wagon, left $5,000 in his will for a fountain for ""men, horses and dogs"" (Henry Weinhard offered to pump beer into the fountain for the dedication). His friends raised an additional $18,000 and New York sculptor Olin Levi Warner was commissioned to design it. The fountain was styled after fountains Skidmore viewed on his visit to the 1878 Paris Exposition. It is 14-feet-tall with a bronze basin eight feet in diameter resting on a central granite shaft and two bronze caryatids, classical Grecian female figures. Four stone watering troughs alternate with stone steps leading to the octagonal base, which is inscribed ""Good citizens are the riches of a city,"" a quote from C.E.S. Wood. The troughs fill with water flowing from the fountain through miniature lion heads. In its early days, metal drinking cups were attached by chains to four of the heads. The bronze work was cast by Bureau Bros. of Philadelphia and the base was made of dressed granite from the Franklin quarries in Maine. Although, the plaza was the center of Portland when the fountain was dedicated on September 22, 1888, the New York Tribune implied that the fountain was too fine an achievement ""for a western city with its bewhiskered, bepistoled lot of frontiersmen.""",,Ankeny Plaza,,,,,45.522693,-122.670003

In 1931, the St Johns Bridge was built on the site with 400-ft towers and a main span of 1,207 feet. It is the only steel suspension bridge in Portland.  In the early 1970s, Howard Galbraith, the ""honorary mayor"" of unincorporated St Johns, got tired of the junkyard state of the area under the eastern end of the bridge. He organized a drive that eventually raised $7.5 million to build a park. After eight years of community fundraising, combined with state, county and city funding, the park was dedicated at a community celebration on May 3, 1980. It got its name from a photo of the St Johns Bridge by Al Monner that appeared on the front page of the Oregon Journal in 1968. Reference was made to its beautiful cathedral-like arches and the park found its name.  In June of 1980, the Cathedral Park Committee sealed a time capsule (complete with ash from Mt St Helens) into the Wall of History in the Memorial Garden in the park. The time capsule will be opened in 2030. Measurements for how to find the capsule (which is covered with a stone that matches the rest of the wall) have been left with the Oregon History Center. Committee chairperson Sharon Roso said, ""We want to make sure that in 2030 people will remember there's a celebration due in St Johns.""  In 2008, a sculpture by Donald Fels was installed beneath the St Johns Bridge. <i>Drawing on the River</> reflects back on a century of industry in St Johns and is an homage to both the mills and the workers who ran them. The piece also invokes the river itself, which powered the mills and is the reason the workers settled here. <p>",,Cathedral Park,,,,,45.587447,-122.761295
99,99,Chapman Square,SW 4th Avenue and Main Street,1869,0,1,97205,CC/NW,Park hours: 5:00am-midnight,,"Chapman is one of two courthouse squares that comprise the Plaza Blocks which are bounded by Third and Fourth Avenues and Salmon and Madison Streets. The south square is named for former Iowa territorial legislator and native Virginian William Williams Chapman (1808-1892) who arrived in Portland in 1850. An attorney with business interests, he also served as surveyor general of Oregon. In 1870, he sold this portion of his land claim to the city. The north square is named for Kentuckian Daniel H. Lownsdale, who settled in Portland in 1845 when there were fewer than 800 people living in the city.  The Plaza Blocks were lively places where orators held forth and citizens assembled. They are characterized in part by several large old elms and gingko trees. Chapman Square, originally designed for the exclusive use of women and children, features all female gingko trees. Lownsdale Square was to be the ""gentlemen's gathering place."" Today the Plaza Blocks are still a busy gathering place, although men and women can now safely coexist in either of them.  In Chapman Square is a bronze statue commissioned by the Oregon Trail Coordinating Council to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Oregon Trail in 1993. <i>The Promised Land</i>, by Oregon artist David Manuel, depicts a pioneer family - father, mother, and son - at the end of their journey. The red granite slab upon which the statue is mounted is inscribed with a quote by Thomas Jefferson. The plaza in front of the statue is sandblasted with footprints reminiscent of pre-settlement days: jackrabbit, black bear, porcupine, grouse, coyote, elk, and moccasin prints.  Between the two Plaza Blocks, Main Street curves around the second oldest sculpture in the Portland metro area - a huge elk fountain given to the city by David P. Thompson. Thompson arrived in Portland driving sheep over the Oregon Trail. He served as Portland's mayor from 1879-1882. One day he looked out of the office window in his New Market Building at the Skidmore Fountain and decided that he wanted to dedicate a fountain to the city as well. As founder and director of the Oregon Humane Society, Thompson’s vision for the sculpture was to provide an accessible watering place for ""bird, beast, and human."" He commissioned Roland Roland Hinton Perry, whose work adorns the Library of Congress and the dome of the Pennsylvania state capitol, to create the sculpture. Local architect H.G. Wright designed the stone base of eastern granite, which included drinking troughs for horses and dogs. In 1900, the 3,000-pound bronze fountain was placed in a site that was a former feeding ground for elk that wandered down from the west hills of the city. The Exalted Order of Elks refused to dedicate it because they considered the statue ""a monstrosity of art."" Many have tried to have Thompson's elk removed because it can be considered a traffic obstacle, but the statue remains. In 1974, after a debate about disturbing the blocks in order to complement the then-new General Services Building, Thompson's elk and the Plaza Blocks were designated as Historic Landmarks. <p>",,Chapman Square,,,,,45.515387,-122.677731

105,105,Eastbank Esplanade,SE Water Avenue and Hawthorne Blvd,1998,10.69104671,1,97214,SE," <p><strong><a href=""/parks/article/643913"">Learn more about swimming in the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.</a></strong></p> The Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade is 1.5 miles long, extending north from the Hawthorne Bridge, past the Morrison and Burnside Bridges, to the Steel Bridge with connections to eastside neighborhoods as well as across the river to Gov. Tom McCall Waterfront Park.  <b>Features</b> The historic nature of the Burnside Bridge prohibits any structure from adding any weight to the bridge: the connector that connects the Esplanade to the Burnside Bridge does not lean on the bridge, it merely 'kisses' the bridge. The connector is held in place by pilings sunk into a huge concrete base and the tower structure bears the weight of the stair truss.  Designed by Mayer/Reed, landscape architects, there are 13 urban markers at key locations along the Esplanade that mark the eastside city street grid. Mayer/Reed also designed 22 interpretive panels that are attached to the markers. The panels provide information about the river and the rich history of the area - from the building of Portland’s bridges to the development of Portland’s eastside. Each marker also includes unique lighting to illuminate the walkway at night.  The Esplanade is a demonstration project for improved habitat areas for fish and wildlife and riverbank restoration. In places, the riverbank has been reshaped with grading that allows for shallow habitat. Bio-engineering techniques use native vegetation and other areas pre-treat I-5 runoff before it enters the river. (All this is a unique feat for a river that seasonally fluctuates 30 feet in water depth.) The plantings also minimize the need for riprap rock for erosion control. 280 trees and 43,695 shrubs were planted along the Esplanade, mostly native plants of Oregon.  The construction timeline for the Esplanade, especially work that had to be done in the river, was timed carefully to be sensitive to fish migration seasons. Several large 'root wads' were trucked to the site from Central Oregon and were anchored in place along the riverbank to provide important habitat areas for fish. Wildlife that inhabits this area includes beavers, ducks, geese, herons, steelhead, and salmon.  To the north of the Morrison Bridge, the Esplanade provides a lookout over what looks like strange rock formations, but which is actually a large accumulation of concrete. The concrete was dumped in this location by cement trucks washing their truck beds in the river during the building of the Morrison Bridge.  Four pieces of public art, created by RIGGA - a group of local artists, are featured between the Morrison Bridge and the floating walkway. The <i>Echo Gate</i> by Ean Eldred, located beneath the Morrison Bridge, is a sculpture that 'echoes' the pier buildings and Shanghai tunnels of Portland's past. It is made of copper plate that was heat-formed, fitted, and welded. Two pieces of art sit on a concrete wall that is a remnant from the bulkhead of the Port of Portland's Terminal 2 and serves as a reminder of early maritime commerce along Portland’s eastside. The <i>Ghost Ship</i> by James Harrison, sited on the south end of the wall, is a grand lantern made of copperplate, copper bar, a stainless steel substructure, and fit with hundreds of prismatic pieces of art glass. It pays homage to the many ships that have come through Portland, and the ones that have gone down in crossing the Columbia River Bar. At the north end, <i>Stack Stalk</i>, also by Ean Eldred, is a hybrid beacon - part masthead, part wheat stem, part smokestack. Made of rolled steel tubes and a stainless steel basket, it suspends a Japanese glass fishing float in the sky as a reminder of the river's connection with the Pacific Ocean. The final piece, the <i>Alluvial Wall</i> by Peter Nylen, clings to a concrete retaining wall and echoes the natural shape of the river before Portland was Portland. It alludes to the interwoven layers of the river’s pre-industrial geology and human artifacts; an amalgam of sedimentation and erosion formed of cold-forged steel plate with bronze castings lodged between its layers.  At 1,200 feet, the floating walkway is the longest one of its kind in the United States, and offers the sensation of walking on water. The adjoining 120-ft public boat dock provides moorage for recreational boaters as well as space for a future river taxi and other commercial uses.  The Steel Bridge RiverWalk, attached about 30 feet above the Willamette River, offers pedestrians and bicyclists a new route across the river and provides visitors on the eastside with a stunning overlook from which to view the downtown cityscape.",,"The Eastbank Esplanade has been an important part of the long-term vision for downtown Portland. Early city planners included the park in the 1988 Central City Plan. At the direction of City Council in 1993, work began on developing a master plan to guide the design and construction of the Eastbank Esplanade. The City formed a citizen Eastbank Riverfront Project Advisory Committee (PAC) to provide project oversight to City staff. The PAC included members of adjacent neighborhoods, the Central Eastside Industrial Council, landowners, river and environmental enthusiasts, and long-time parks activists. Hargreaves Associates, landscape architects based in San Francisco, was selected as the lead consultant.   Completed in January 1994, the Eastbank Master Plan described an esplanade with docks, piers, overlooks, a plaza for festivals and gatherings, floating walkways, fountains, public art, and connections to the neighborhoods and Portland’s bridges. The Esplanade would connect the east and west sides of the Central City around its central feature – the Willamette River. Construction of the Esplanade began in October 1998 and was completed in May 2001.  The Esplanade was named after Mayor Vera Katz in November 2004 to honor her vision and leadership for Portland - which included support for the construction of the esplanade. A bronze sculpture of the mayor by Bill Bane was installed on the plaza at the south end of the esplanade in June 2006. <p>",,Eastbank Esplanade,,,,,45.519678,-122.66708

It came into being originally as a golf course for the use of members of the Multnomah Athletic Club. When one of the members of the Multnomah Club returned from Spokane, where he saw how a golf course was created with help from the municipal Park Commission, an idea had been planted. A committee was organized, with members serving from each of the three local golf courses (Waverly, Portland, and Tualatin). The plan was to rent a 150-acre plot of pasture land that had been leased to the Willsburg Dairy. This agreement was to have lasted for five years. Portland's Mayor Albee approved of the project, and soon the City was purchasing rather than renting. Chandler Egan, a former national amateur golf champion and leading golf course architect, was commissioned to design the course, and in 1917, Portland had its first public golf course. <p>",5037752900,Eastmoreland Golf Course,,,,,45.473527,-122.636985

When the proposed Mt. Hood freeway project fell through, Benedict worked hard to ensure that the land that had been purchased as an easement for the freeway be developed as a neighborhood park. In 1988 the parcel known as Mt Hood Park was deeded to the City of Portland for ""eventual use as a recreational park."" Benedict died that year and, in his will, left money to establish a trust fund to develop the park. Ed Benedict Community Park was officially named at a ceremony on July 29, 1991.

A Native American legend holds that this was a good spot to stampede a herd of elk over the cliff. The island gets its name from being near Elk Rock.   Elk Rock Island was part of the original donation land claim of Milwaukie pioneer Lot Whitcomb and was known as Lot Whitcomb Island during the 1860s. It went through six owners before Scottish grain exporter and Portland businessman Peter Kerr (1862-1957) acquired the property in 1910 from the Rock Island Club, which operated a dance hall on the island. He gave the island to the City of Portland in 1940 with the requirement that it be preserved in its natural state. As Kerr put it, ""Preserve it as a pretty place for all to enjoy.""

An abundance of wildlife (more than 112 bird and 62 mammal species) can be found in Forest Park. With its massive tree canopy and substantial undergrowth, the park serves as a natural air purifier, water collector, and erosion controller.  The 30-mile Wildwood Trail in Forest Park is part of the region’s 40-Mile Loop system that links Forest Park to pedestrian and trail routes along the Columbia River to Gresham, through southeast Portland, along the Willamette Greenway, and back to the Marquam Trail in southwest Portland. A landmark on the trail is the Stone House. This structure was built in the mid-1930s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) as a public restroom. The infamous Columbus Day storm on October 12, 1962, took out the water line. Because the structure had been heavily vandalized over the years, the decision was made to gut the building rather than embark on costly repairs. It remains as a favorite spot to rest along the trail.","In 1803, William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame) paddled far enough up the Willamette River to see Forest Park's present location. He described this forest as having Douglas fir as its predominant tree, with trunks ranging from five to eight feet in diameter.  From almost the earliest time of subsequent European settlement along the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers, the vision of a great natural park along the eastern slope of Portland's northwest hills, which Native Americans called the Tualatin Mountains, was pursued over the years by various civic leaders. The first of these visionaries was the Reverend Thomas Lamb Eliot who arrived in Portland in 1867. His persistence led to the formation of the Municipal Park Commission of Portland in 1899. The Commission brought in the famous landscape architecture firm, Olmsted Brothers of Brookline, Massachusetts, to prepare a park planning study for the City in 1903. Their recommendations included the development of the 40-mile Loop and the acquisition of the wooded hills west of the Willamette River for a park with a wild, woodland character. In their report, they maintained that ""...a visit to the woods would afford more pleasure and satisfaction than a visit to any other sort of park..."" and ""...no use to which this tract of land could be put would begin to be as sensible or as profitable to the city as that of making it a public park.""  Frederick Van Voorhies Holman, a prominent lawyer in Portland during the 1890s and a president of the Oregon Historical Society, donated a 52-acre parcel to what would become Forest Park. Part of the Holman property had been flushed down to Guild's Lake by Lafe Pence's flume in 1909. After Pence was brought to task, Holman had a plaster of paris scale model made of the property to estimate how much it would cost to return the property to its original contours in order to develop it. Discouraged by the City from taking such a great risk, he offered the property as a park if the property between it and Macleay Park were acquired. The property was donated to the city by his siblings George F. and Mary Holman on August 16, 1939.  Various setbacks delayed the formation of the forested park, including rumors of oil existing in the hillside, until the City Club of Portland undertook a feasibility study which it published in 1945. From there the 'Committee of Fifty' civic leaders persevered until 4,200 acres were formally dedicated as Forest Park in late September 1948. Additional acres have been added over the years; Forest Park now includes over 5,100 wooded acres making it the largest, forested natural area within city limits in the United States.

Stephens. The property was divided and one, if not both, parcels were purchased by Philip A. Marquam, who was for many years the largest landowner in Multnomah County. In July 1888, Southwest Portland Company purchased the land for $150,000, creating the original 411 acres of the Fulton Park District. In June 1910, B.M. Lombard, in partnership with Fulton Park Land Company, recorded a replat of 272 acres of the Fulton Park District land, creating South Burlingame Neighborhood.  In 1914, the Fulton Park Elementary School was built. The school housed grades K-8 in its four classrooms all opening into a central gymnasium, complete with a stage. A later remodel of the building included a new kitchen and additional bathroom facilities. The building was designed by Floyd Archibald Naramore, who was the architect and superintendent of school properties for Portland Public Schools from 1912 to 1919. In his seven years in Portland, Naramore designed and built many schools including the historic Kennedy School in northeast Portland.  In 1958, PP&R obtained the school building through a leasing agreement with Portland Public Schools whereby PP&R would maintain and use the facility until such time that it may be needed as a school again. PP&R owned the land upon which the facility was built, as well as the adjacent forested area, park, and community garden properties.

Salmon Street Springs was dedicated in 1988, although it wasn't named until a contest was held in 1989. Designed by Robert Perron Landscape Architects and Planners, the fountain is controlled by an underground computer that changes the pattern of the fountain's 185 water jets. The three cycles of the fountain are called misters, bollards, and wedding cake. At full capacity, the fountain recycles 4,924 gallons of water per minute through as many as 137 jets at once.  On August 3, 1990, the Japanese American Historical Plaza was dedicated to the memory of those who were deported to inland internment camps during World War II. In the memorial garden, artwork tells the story of the Japanese people in the Northwest - of immigration, elderly immigrants, native-born Japanese Americans, soldiers who fought in US military services during the war, and the business people who worked hard and had hope for the children of the future. A sculpture by Jim Gion, <i>Songs of Innocence, Songs of Experience</i>, serves as a gateway to the plaza.  A non-profit organization, the Oregon Nikkei Endowment, fueled the commemoration with help from PP&R, Metropolitan Arts Commission, Portland Development Commission, and the Portland-Sapporo Sister City Association. Designed by award-winning landscape architect Robert Murase, the plaza is 70 feet wide at its narrowest, 200 feet at its widest. It extends between NW Davis & Naito Parkway (formerly Front Ave) and the Willamette River esplanade for about 300 feet northward from the Burnside Bridge. One hundred ornamental cherry trees link the plaza northward to the <I>Friendship Circle</I>, a collaboration by sculptor Lee Kelly and composer Michael Stirling. From a wide concrete circle rise a pair of 20-foot stainless towers from which emanates music based upon traditional and contemporary Japanese instruments. The sculpture commemorates 30 years of the Sister City relationship between Sapporo, Japan and Portland.  In 1993, the Police Memorial, located at SW Jefferson near the Hawthorne Bridge, was dedicated to Portland police officers who had given their lives in the performance of their official duties.","The idea for this park came at the turn of the century when the 1903 Olmsted Report pointed out the need not only for parks within the city, but for a greenway scheme for the riverbanks in order to ensure their preservation for future generations. The 1912 Bennett Plan again showed a need for more parks and river greenways, but instead of reorienting itself to the river, the city's focus was pulled further inland. In the late 1920s, the seawall was built along the Willamette's west bank for the protection of downtown from the annual floods. The seawall not only cut off the water from the people, but the people from the water as well. The construction of Harbor Drive along the west bank in the 1940s continued the trend of isolating the public from the river.  With the opening of the Eastbank Freeway (Marquam Bridge, I-5), Harbor Drive became less important to the traffic flow of the city. Governor Tom McCall created the Harbor Drive Task Force in 1968 in order to study proposals for creating a public open space in its place. In 1974, Harbor Drive was torn up and construction of a waterfront park began. It was completed and dedicated in 1978, gaining instant popularity. In 1984, the park was renamed Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park. <p>",,Waterfront Park,,,,,45.517068,-122.672218

Harney was the commander of the U.S. Army's Department of Oregon from 1858-59. Harney was instrumental in making San Juan Island, off Washington's coast, part of the United States rather than part of Canada.  The park that bears Harney's name was originally a neighborhood eyesore; it was the location of illegal dumping and was a magnet for 4-wheelers out for a spin. When the neighbors decided that something needed to be done, they applied for a Housing and Community Development grant from Multnomah County. The neighbors received a $50,000 grant and the assurance that the Marines would volunteer to grade the park. Due to the passage of the 1989 Park Improvement Levy, PP&R matched the Multnomah County funds. The community was able to drum up enough extra money to complete the project by gaining the support of the Portland Trail Blazers, the Rose Festival Association, and Precision Castparts, one of the major employers of the neighborhood's working population.

For centuries the seasonal rise and fall of the water made it a rich plant and animal habitat and an important Indian gathering place. In the early 1900s levees were constructed for drainage which allowed for industrial development in the area.   The present 340-acre site was once part of Vanport City, which at the time, was the second-largest city in Oregon, and remains the largest government housing project in US history. The construction of Vanport began in 1943 to house nearly 40,000 workers who came to work for the Oregon Shipbuilding Company during the height of wartime production. Following World War II, the population was reduced by half due to many wartime workers leaving, although the newly built Vanport College (present-day Portland State University) attracted a large number of veterans and their families.   On May 30, 1948, excessively high water levels caused a 200' break in the dike that held back the Columbia River, resulting in massive flooding that killed 15 residents and virtually destroyed the entire city.  It would be almost another two decades before initial construction began on the first of the two golf courses at Heron Lakes. Designed by renowned golf architects Robert Trent Jones, Sr. and his son Robert Trent Jones II, the first 18 holes (present-day Greenback) and clubhouse were opened in 1971, under the name West Delta Park Golf Course. Along with the name change to Heron Lakes, another 9 holes were added during the 1980s giving the facility three 9-hole courses called the Red, White, and Blue. An additional fourth set of 9 holes were added in 1992 to form the present Great Blue Course. In 2008 the City of Portland selected KemperSports to manage the property and assist in the process of developing a new clubhouse facility. <p>",5032891818,Heron Lakes Golf Course,,,,,45.603295,-122.704074

After the school moved, the Portland Art Association purchased the land and buildings in 1968 for use as an artists’ cooperative. In 1972, finding the property too costly to maintain, the Art Association decided to sell, and word spread throughout the community that the most likely buyer was a condominium developer. Since many of the homes in the area are situated on steep lots with no backyards, residents felt that the site would be better used as a park and community center. The problem, of course, was money.  A citizen’s organization, Citizens for Hillside Community & Recreation Center, Inc. (CHCRC), was formed for the purpose of preserving the property for a public park and community center. The CHCRC entered into an agreement with the Oregon Parks Foundation to help with the property acquisition and negotiated with the Art Association for a one-year option to purchase the land and buildings for $106,500.  In early 1973, the option was secured with a down payment of money raised by the neighborhood. After an exhaustive neighborhood fundraising effort generated additional monies, including contributions from private foundations and City Council, the community was still $25,000 short. To make up the difference, twelve families, sometimes referred to as the ‘Trembling Twelve,’ took out second mortgages on their homes to guarantee a loan of $25,000 from the Bank of California that finalized the purchase of the property. Over the next several years, the community continued to hold fundraising events to help the families pay off the second mortgages.  In spring of 1974, the CHCRC, through the Oregon Parks Foundation, transferred the property over to the City of Portland, which accepted it as a public park and agreed to maintain the property and staff a community center. To create more open space, PP&R razed three of the four buildings on the property, keeping the gymnasium. Tennis courts, a soccer field, and a children’s play area were constructed to provide outdoor play spaces, and the gymnasium was remodeled with care taken to preserve the building’s exterior beauty.  The center was awarded a $75,000 grant in 2002 and a $75,000 grant in 2003 from the Northwest Neighborhoods Parks and Recreation Fund (I-405 Fund) of The Oregon Community Foundation. The grants were to be used to design and build a 580 sq ft multi-purpose room adjacent to the main building. However, in October 2003, the center experienced a fire that destroyed the kitchen and caused severe smoke damage throughout the rest of the building. Construction of the multi-purpose room was delayed until 2004, to coordinate that project with the repairs and clean-up needed on the main building. <p>",5038233181,Hillside Community Center,,https://www.CMCpdxcom/HillsideCommunityCenter/,,,45.527784,-122.70971

He stirred things up wherever he went and was a bit of a dandy, dressing like a riverboat gambler. He was said to be ""wholly destitute of fixed principles of honesty, morality, or common decency."" In 1868 Holladay sold his stage coach business in California to Wells Fargo and moved to Portland to get involved in the railroad business. His goal was to build a rail line to California along the east side of the Willamette River. In order to do so, he spent a total of $55,000 in bribe money to help secure his company's endorsement. He also built two large hotels in the area where the park bearing his name is now located. Known as an extravagant spender, Holladay owned numerous mansions on both coasts and had over extended himself financially. He lost his railroad in 1876, and died in Portland in 1887.  Commissioned by the Lloyd Corporation and Pacific Power & Light in 1964, a concrete fountain featuring music and lights was installed in the park. Designed by Jack Stuhl, assisted by Ted Widing and Phillips Electrical, the musical fountain was favorite gathering place for park visitors. It was replaced in 2000, in conjunction with a major renovation of the park, by a spouting fountain designed by Tim Clemen and Murase Associates.  Three cast-bronze sculptures by artist Tad Savinar were added to the park as a percent-for-art project in 2000. Entitled <i>Constellation</i>, the project illustrates the connection between the personal front yard garden and the civic park garden through three distinct elements: a vase of cut flowers, an abstract molecule containing elements of a good neighborhood, and the figure of a home gardener, shears in hand. The objects in the molecule were selected by the Sullivan Gulch Neighborhood Association and the gardener was modeled after Carolyn Marks, a longtime neighborhood activist.",,Holladay Park,,,,,45.530752,-122.653614

Multnomah County gave the Parks Bureau perpetual use of approximately 145 acres of land north of Washington Park for this purpose. It was named Hoyt Arboretum in honor of Ralph Warren Hoyt, the county commissioner who championed the formation of the arboretum.  Most of the collection is arranged in family groups: all the oaks are in one area and all of the redwoods are in another. Grouping by scientific classification, or taxonomic arrangement, was in vogue when the Arboretum was first laid out. In the 1930s, planners decided to use Fairview Boulevard to divide the conifers from the deciduous trees: conifers were planted on the west side and deciduous trees on the east.  Hoyt Arboretum’s plant collection contains 6,000 individual trees and shrubs, representing 2,000 different species from around the world.

When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. Epidemics of smallpox, malaria, and measles reduced this population to 88 by 1851, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands, including Johnson Creek.  By the middle of the 19th century, European American settlers had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms, a trend that has continued. <p>",,Johnson Creek Park,,,,,45.460599,-122.642316
207,207,Johnson Lake Property,NE Glass Plant Road and Simpson Street,1996,15.19542127,0,97218,NE,,,"Harry Johnson purchased the lake in 1911. Over a half a century ago this lake was the recreational center of the area. The lake, which is fed with 20 springs, was so clear that you could see the bottom of the lake. The springs in the shallow areas were so strong that the water resembled bubbling fountains. People rented boats to play, fish, and swim on the clear waters. There was a beach house where they could change, a dance hall where they could recreate. In the late 1940s the dance hall burned down, but the community still enjoyed the lake for a number of years.  With the Vanport Flood in 1948, the lake was flooded by the slough and became murky. In the 1950s, Owens-Illinois (glass factory) purchased the land to the south and west of the lake and the area where the lake flows into the slough system from Mr. Johnson. The following year, a mysterious 'sludge' began appearing on the lake (Owens-Illinois was eventually fined for this). This began what seemed to be a lifelong issue between Harry Johnson and Owens-Illinois. In the 1960s, Mr. Johnson constructed a logjam around the outflow pipes where Owens-Illinois dumped into the lake in an attempt to try to keep the oil and surface pollutants from spreading across the surface of the lake. At that time the neighborhood kids were still swimming and fishing on this lake.  When I-205 was constructed in the late 1960s–early 1970s, a portion of the lake and a small stream that flowed into it were filled in. Over the next two decades, fishermen continued to spend time on the lake until they noticed that the fish they were catching had sores on them. In 1996 the City of Portland purchased Harry Johnson's half of the lake from his daughter, Dorothy Thoreson, and it became an environmentally protected area. In 1997, a number of people got together and planted 1,000 trees on the property. A class of students from Madison High School did a study on the history of the lake and did testing on the water quality. Volunteers continue to try to keep the blackberry vines under control.  PP&R, Bureau of Environmental Services, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, and the Columbia Slough Watershed Council are involved in trying to recover the lake and the surrounding habitat. A consortium of these agencies and the neighborhood associations for Parkrose, Sumner, and Cully are committed to this effort.  <I>(Information provided by Marcy Emerson-Peters)</I>",,Johnson Lake Property,,,,,45.5656,-122.561166

The park and the neighborhood, platted in 1889, are named after Sir Walter Scott's 1821 novel <I>Kenilworth</I>, a romantic novel set in Elizabethan England. Many of the streets in the neighborhood took their names from this novel and other novels by Scott.  In 1910, Park Superintendent Emanuel Mische created a design for the park that was inspired by the park's natural topography and vegetation. The design included a bandstand, tennis courts, sports field, wading pool and play area, sand courts, walkways, and vista points. In 1912 a comfort station pavilion was added and remains an important historic feature of the park. Designed by Ellis Lawrence in the 20th Century Classic style, it is significant for its cubist form and decorative brickwork arches. Originally the arches were open and provided unobstructed views of the city; in 1983, in order to curb vandalism, metal doors were added to close off the pavilion when not in use.

In 1949, the Park Bureau created a Junior Museum in the building, later renamed the Children's Museum, until it was relocated to the former OMSI building in Washington Park in 2001.  The smaller building, the Customs House, was built in 1921 as a branch of the county library. The building, Italian Renaissance Revival, is one of seven Carnegie-funded branch libraries in Portland.

Ladd, who developed Ladd's Addition and twice was mayor of Portland. Ladd named his 486-acre parcel Hazel Fern Farm, after the name of one of the streets in the area. Here Ladd developed one of the most prestigious stock farms in the West. In fact, his purebred Jersey cattle probably laid the foundation for Oregon's future livestock industry. As East Portland developed, Ladd's tract of land became too valuable for agricultural use. Ladd sold his land for over $1,000,000 to the Laurelhurst Company around the turn of the century.  A spring-fed pond on the property had always been a favorite watering hole for cattle, as well as a favorite swimming hole for both children and adults. In 1911, seeing the potential for a park as part of the Olmsted Plan, the City of Portland bought 30 of the acres, including the pond.  In 1912, Emanuel Mische, Portland's park superintendent from 1908-1914, designed the park based on his experience as the longtime horticultural expert for the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm. Inspired by the Olmstedian 'natural' landscaping approach, his plan included several distinct sections - the concert grove, Firwood Lake, children's lawn, plateau and broad meadows, picnic grove, and Rhododendron Hill. Workers were hired to deepen the pond into a 3-acre lake. A 'play park' was developed between Oak and Stark Streets. The boys were to play on the south side, the girls on the north side, and general games were to be held in the eastern block. The park's comfort station building was added in 1914 and a series of paths and sidewalks were lit by electric lights in 1915.  Laurelhurst Park is a perfect example of the City Beautiful Movement in landscaping. In 1919, the park was named the most beautiful park on the west coast by the Pacific Coast Parks Association. Thanks to the efforts of the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission, in February 2001 Laurelhurst Park was named to the National Register of Historic Places, the first city park ever listed on the national register.  For years, the Rose Festival Queen's Coronation took place in the Laurelhurst Park pond on floating boats and decorated rafts. The event drew thousands of onlookers who were attracted to the music, dancing, and pageantry. In the 1950s, Easter Sunrise Services were held, drawing thousands of people.  In the park's early years, the pond was patrolled by a white swan named General Pershing (for his militant attitude). He forbade anyone to approach the edge of the lakeshore. In later years a black-beaked, black-toed swan named Big Boy was lake marshall. A man, known only as Mr. Martinson, fed Big Boy every day for 15 years. Mr. Martinson taught Big Boy to nod his head and honk ""Hello!""  Laurelhurst Park's ideal duck population is ten male/female pairs. In 1987, the normal duck population was at 120, with seasonal visitors sometimes boosting numbers over 200. PP&R wanted to reduce the duck population in order to clear up the murkiness from the lake water. An adopt-a-duck venture was unsuccessful because the company hired to catch the birds was unable to trick the birds into their traps.  In 1990, nearly 20,000 catfish, carp, and black crappie fish were stirring up sediment on the lake's bottom. In addition, the water was smelly because of the overcrowding. The Oregon Bass and Panfish Club tried to deplete the fish population to no avail. Today, thousands of fish still inhabit the lake, along with the ducks and turtles. <p>",,Laurelhurst Park,,,,,45.521072,-122.626217

In 1912, the Lents community was annexed from Multnomah County and incorporated into the City of Portland.  According to neighborhood reports, the original 5.2 acres of Lents Park had previously been used as a gravel quarry. During the 1940s and 1950s, an additional 32 acres was purchased from private property owners by the City of Portland in an effort to assemble all of the land between SE 88 & 92 and SE Holgate & Steele for park purposes. In 1953, a central plan was prepared by the City, proposing locations for a baseball stadium, athletic playing fields, tennis courts, community buildings, pathways, and parking areas. Construction on the stadium began in 1956.  The stadium was named after Charles B. Walker. From 1930-1934, he supervised playground softball teams as a playground leader and in 1934, organized the first industrial and commercial softball leagues. In 1935, he was appointed as the city's first Sports Director. From 1944-45, Walker served as an American Red Cross Field Director in Germany. Upon his return from the war, he helped organize the first men's and women's softball tourneys ever held west of the Mississippi. In 1950, he was appointed as the commissioner of the Amateur Softball Association (ASA) for the Portland Metro area. He also served as the Pacific Coast Vice-President of the ASA. He retired from the Parks Bureau in 1969 after 40 years of dedication and service to the game of softball.

The short-lived amusement park was plagued by debt, alleged gangland connections, and a plane crash which destroyed several buildings.

Lovejoy Fountain Park, along with Pettygrove Park, is in what was known in the 1960s as the 'urban renewal area.' The same coin that Mr. Lovejoy and Mr. Pettygrove used to determined whether our city would be called Portland or Boston was flipped to determine which park would be Lovejoy and which would be Pettygrove.  The Lovejoy Fountain was designed by Lawrence Halprin, the well-known San Franciscan architect. The concrete fountain was installed in 1966. ""The fountain wonderfully captures the spirit of Oregon's streams.

243,243,Lownsdale Square,SW 4th Avenue and Main Street,1869,0,1,97205,CC/NW,Park hours: 5:00am-midnight,,"Lownsdale is one of two courthouse squares that comprise the Plaza Blocks which are bounded by Third and Fourth Avenues and Salmon and Madison Streets. The north square is named for Kentuckian Daniel H. Lownsdale, who settled in Portland in 1845 when there were fewer than 800 people living in the city. The south square is named for former Iowa territorial legislator and native Virginian William Williams Chapman (1808-1892) who arrived in Portland in 1850.  The Plaza Blocks were lively places where orators held forth and citizens assembled. They are characterized in part by several large old elms and gingko trees. Chapman Square, originally designed for the exclusive use of women and children, features all female gingko trees. Lownsdale Square was to be the ""gentlemen's gathering place."" Today the Plaza Blocks are still a busy gathering place, although men and women can now safely coexist in either of them.  In the center of Lownsdale Square stands <I>Soldiers Monument</I>, Douglas Tilden’s 1906 sculpture in memory of the Oregonians killed in the Spanish-American War (1898). The tall granite obelisk is topped with a bronze replica of a soldier in the Second Oregon Volunteer Infantry, part of the first large American fighting force ever sent overseas. At the base of this monument are two howitzers used in the defense of Fort Sumter (misspelled as 'Sumpter' on the plaque) in 1861. They were brought to Portland by Colonel Henry E. Dosch. Because the cannons were used by both  Union and Confederate troops, it was Dosch's idea to face one north and the other south.  Another memorial dedicated to the men killed in service in the Philippines, <i>Fountain for Company H</i>, was installed in 1914. It was donated by the mothers, sisters, and wives of the men in Company H of the Second Oregon Volunteers. John H. Beaver, an architectural draftsman, won the honor of designing the limestone fountain and a $50 prize in a citywide contest.  Between the two Plaza Blocks, Main Street curves around the second oldest sculpture in the Portland metro area - a huge elk fountain given to the city by David P. Thompson. Thompson arrived in Portland driving sheep over the Oregon Trail. He served as Portland's mayor from 1879-1882. One day he looked out of the office window in his New Market Building at the Skidmore Fountain and decided that he wanted to dedicate a fountain to the city as well. As founder and director of the Oregon Humane Society, Thompson’s vision for the sculpture was to provide an accessible watering place for ""bird, beast, and human."" He commissioned Roland Roland Hinton Perry, whose work adorns the Library of Congress and the dome of the Pennsylvania state capitol, to create the sculpture. Local architect H.G. Wright designed the stone base of eastern granite, which included drinking troughs for horses and dogs. In 1900, the 3,000-pound bronze fountain was placed in a site that was a former feeding ground for elk that wandered down from the west hills of the city. The Exalted Order of Elks refused to dedicate it because they considered the statue ""a monstrosity of art."" Many have tried to have Thompson's elk removed because it can be considered a traffic obstacle, but the statue remains. In 1974, after a debate about disturbing the blocks in order to complement the then-new General Services Building, Thompson's elk and the Plaza Blocks were designated as Historic Landmarks. <p>",,Lownsdale Square,,,,,45.516054,-122.67737

He arrived in Oregon in 1847 and settled his donation land claim in 1850, carving out a space in the forest for a large cabin for himself, his wife, and their nine children. A nearby claim was taken by the Stump family. The two families did not care for each other. In true Shakespearean fashion, Mortimer Stump, the eldest son of the clan, began courting Anna, the oldest of the Balch daughters. Danford, a peaceful man, warned Mortimer to stay away from his fifteen-year-old daughter, but Mortimer paid no heed. When Anna turned sixteen, she and Mortimer ran away to Vancouver, Washington, where they eloped. Two weeks later, Danford took his shotgun and met members of the Stump family, including his new son-in-law, at the Stark Street Ferry. As the ferry was loading, Danford shot both barrels into Mortimer, who died instantly. Danford claimed the shooting was an accident, but was taken to jail, where he waited until the next spring to be tried. The jail being flimsy, he was able to break out. He hid out in the west hills near his farm until July, when he was re-arrested. In August, he was tried and convicted of the murder. On October 17, 1859 he was hanged at a public gallows in front of over 500 witnesses. The creek that runs through the property bears his name because for years after his hanging people still referred to the area as the Old Balch Place.  In 1862, the claim was sold for $5,000 to John Confer, whom Danford's widow soon married. He then sold the property to John H. Mitchell, the attorney (and later US Senator) who was handling the Balch affairs, for $550. Mitchell also bought the children's claim in the land for $5,500. Two weeks later he sold it to the mayor of Portland for $15,000.  The property was eventually acquired by Donald Macleay, a prominent Portland merchant. Macleay was an early real estate developer and an investor in railroads. He was president of the Portland Board of Trade in the 1880s. Macleay, a Scotsman, gave the land to the city in 1897 in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria's reign, but that was not the only reason! It is said that Macleay complained that his taxes on the property were too high and that he would rather give his land to the city for park purposes than pay so much in taxes. The Deputy Assessor, L. S. Maxwell, countered with, ""Well, then, why don't you?"" Macleay returned to the courthouse three days later with a deed turning the steep, rough gulch of tall timbers into Macleay Park. This was the first true gift of land for parks except for a small portion of Governors Park. One of the provisions of the gift was that ""the city shall provide conveyance for carrying patients from the [area] hospitals through the park during the summer."" The paths were also widened in order to accommodate wheelchairs. This was done so that hospital-bound people would have the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful outdoors, especially in the heat of summer.  In 1905, Lafe Pence from Denver decided to use a mining device called a flume to wash hillsides along Balch Gulch into Guild's Lake to create fill areas for industrial sites. He caused a great ruckus because he ignored getting permission from the legal landowners, but he partially succeeded in his scheme. A portion of the flume was used as a walkway for many years until it was replaced by a trail. <p>",,Macleay Park,,,,,45.529477,-122.720887

To volunteer at your neighborhood park, call 503-823-5121.","The untiring efforts of Jane Baker, an East Portland neighborhood leader who died in April 2002, turned an overgrown vacant lot behind Midland Library into a park. She envisioned a park where residents from all over the area could visit with birds and butterflies, trees and plants; where people could sit on benches and read - or walk on paths among the trees; where local students could be involved in designing, planting, and maintaining a park; and where the books inside the library could be made more real for children - and adults - through connections with the park. Since the mid-County area was unincorporated at that time, Jane knew that whatever got done in the ""park"" would have to be done by volunteer effort. During the late 70s and early 80s, Jane organized volunteer clean-up crews to get rid of the brush and blackberry bushes which covered the lot. She secured a donation of sawdust to cover paths which were carved out by a National Guard crew. With another donation of more than a dozen, hand-made bird houses, and her personal contribution of plantings to stabilize the bank along the north side of the site, her park began to take shape.  Jane's plan involved using the park as a teaching tool for students in local schools. This living lab would allow students to learn how plants and animals lived together in a natural habitat in an urban setting. The proximity to the library was an added benefit in that people of all ages could learn about the natural world just outside its doors. Although Jane never saw the completion of the park, friends and neighbors formed Jane's Park Group to ensure that her vision was implemented. Today Midland Park is a fitting memorial to this dedicated volunteer. <p>",,Midland Park,,,,,45.516388,-122.539583
265,265,Mill Ends Park,SW Naito Parkway and Taylor Street,1976,0,1,97204,CC/NW,,,"In 1946, Dick Fagan returned from World War II to resume his journalistic career with the <I>Oregon Journal</I>. His office, on the second floor above Front Street (now Naito Parkway), gave him a view of not only the busy street, but also an unused hole in the median where a light pole was to be placed.  When no pole arrived to fill in this hole, weeds took over the space. Fagan decided to take matters into his own hands and to plant flowers.  Fagan wrote a popular column called Mill Ends (rough, irregular pieces of lumber left over at lumber mills). He used this column to describe the park and the various ""events"" that occurred there. Fagan billed the space as the ""World's Smallest Park."" The park was dedicated on St. Patrick's Day in 1948 since Fagan was a good Irishman. He continued to write about activities in the park until he died in 1969. Many of his columns described the lives of a group of leprechauns, who established the ""only leprechaun colony west of Ireland"" in the park. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O'Toole. After Mill Ends officially became a city park on St. Patrick’s Day in 1976, the park continued to be the site of St. Patrick's Day festivities.  Over the years, contributions have been made to the park, such as the small swimming pool and diving board for butterflies, many statues, a miniature Ferris wheel (which was brought in by a normal-sized crane), and the occasional flying saucer. The events held here include concerts by Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court.  The park had to be moved temporarily in 2006 due to construction on Naito Parkway. It was replaced on March 16, 2007 in true St. Patrick's Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and the Fagan family, including Dick's wife Katherine, in attendance.",,Mill Ends Park,,,,,45.516189,-122.673291

Tabor Invasive Plant Control and Revegetation Project</a>","Portland's Mt. Tabor, a volcanic cinder cone, was named by Plympton Kelly, son of Oregon City pioneer resident Clinton Kelly, after Mt. Tabor in Israel, six miles east of Nazareth. In 1894, the city built two open reservoirs on the site (two other open reservoirs were built in 1911). By 1900, Portland's growing eastside population demanded park space; in 1903 landscape architect John C. Olmsted recommended the city obtain more land at Mt. Tabor. In 1909, the Board of Park Commissioners used voter-approved bonds to buy approximately forty lots on Mt. Tabor for $366,000.  Portland Parks Superintendent Emanuel Tillman Mische, who had worked with the Olmsted Brothers' landscape design firm in Massachusetts, developed a naturalistic design for the park. The plan included long flights of stairs, gently curving parkways, numerous walking trails, and a nursery yard. It also showcased native plants. In 1912, construction workers discovered volcanic cinders which were later utilized in surfacing the park's roads.  At the crest of the park is a bronze statue of Harvey W. Scott, editor of <i>The Oregonian</i> newspaper from 1865-1872 and from 1877 until his death in 1910. A gift to the city by Scott's widow, Margaret, and family, it was sculpted by Gutzon Borglum in the early 1930s while he was at work on his monumental sculpture of four American presidents on Mt. Rushmore in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Cast by the Kunst Foundry in New York, it was unveiled in June 1933 with great ceremony.  In 2017, the Mt. Tabor Park summit restrooms were reopened after being closed for many years. Funding from the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond allowed critical improvements like new plumbing, electrical systems, sewer line, lighting, roof, seismic upgrades, and ADA accessibility improvements from Harvey Scott Drive to the ADA accessible restroom.",,Mt.

In 1973, the focus changed from sports-related activities to arts and crafts, which were more suited to the space and layout of the building, and the center was renamed the Multnomah Community Design Center. With the addition of ceramic, pottery, and weaving classes, the center was renamed Multnomah Arts Center in 1978.  After the 1979 closure of the Multnomah Elementary School (built in 1919), parents created the Multnomah Historical Association to preserve the buildings, history, and memorabilia of the community. Due in part to the efforts of the association, the school became the new community center. It was acquired by Portland Parks & Recreation in 1980 and renovated.

Captain John Couch dedicated the blocks to the City in 1869. City plats show the park blocks continuing to Front Street, but Tanner Creek and poor drainage were obstacles to development and land north of Glisan remained vacant. The original design concept for the North Park Blocks was for a continuation of the South Park Blocks promenade. However, the linking was impeded early on by Benjamin Stark's reluctance to give the city the two blocks between Ankeny and Stark. The six blocks between Salmon and Stark donated by Daniel Lownsdale became part of a legal battle with his second wife's heirs. The court ruled in their favor and the property was eventually sold and developed. On the remaining blocks, trees were planted in rows like those in the South Park Blocks, using Big leaf maples and Black locusts with American elms at the street edge.  By the 1880s, the area was predominantly residential, but not fashionable like the South Park Blocks. Modest one- and two-story houses were built. From the turn of the century, more commercial and light industrial businesses and residential hotels were developed in the area. The railroad purchased the land north of Park to Front and expanded its rail yards.  In 1908, the People's Institute operated a playground and welfare program in the North Park Blocks. The next year the Park Commission added play equipment and took over. This became the Portland's first supervised playground, separating the boys from the girls. It became popular citywide. In 1920, tennis courts were built in the northernmost block and play areas were developed between Everett and Glisan. Also built around this time were two brick restrooms in the Ankeny block. As more playgrounds were developed in other parks, and commercial and industrial uses pushed out residential use, the park began to decline. Many large trees were damaged in the 1962 Columbus Day storm and were removed, changing the character of the park.  In 1992, a series of improvements was completed in the North Parks Blocks. Pains were taken to protect and preserve the remaining historic trees that had stood there since the park's inception. Light fixtures were replaced with the same style of ornamental ones now in the South Park Blocks. Different colored paving stones were used on the pathways to create bright, winding lanes. In 1993, a new playground was built and its popularity brought some vitality back to the park.  In October 2002, a 12-foot bronze sculpture was installed between Burnside and Couch streets. Based on a wine pitcher from the late Shang Dynasty (circa 1200-1100 BC), this sculpture is about sixteen times larger than the original. The young elephant standing peacefully on his father's back symbolizes safe and prosperous offspring. The elaborate surface decoration features cloud-shaped curves and birds and animals from ancient Chinese mythology. The piece is titled <i>Da Tung & Xi'an Bao Bao</i>. Da Tung may be translated as ""universal peace"" or ""large bronze."" Xi'an Bao Bao means ""baby elephant."" The sculpture was a gift to the city from Chinese businessman Huo Baozhu, whose foundry in Xi'an, China, is licensed by the national government to reproduce Chinese antiquities. Huo, who visited Portland a number of times, said he was motivated by a love of Chinese history and admiration for Portland.  In February 2005, a fountain designed by the famous weimaraner dog photographer William Wegman was installed between Davis and Everett streets. <i>Dog Bowl</i> measures 8x10 feet with checkerboard black and white granite tiles to resemble a patch of linoleum kitchen floor; four of the squares are artificial turf. Wegman designed the cast-bronze dog bowl, with water burbling up from an underground source, to be reminiscent of the Benson bubbler drinking fountains placed around town in 1912 by philanthropist Simon Benson. <p>",,North Park Blocks,,,,,45.52517,-122.678882

He was elected as Portland's first mayor in the city's first election on April 7, 1851, by receiving 104 of the 222 votes cast.  In the early 1900s, the Rivoli Theater and the Basket Grocery were the two best known features on the block. Built by Robert S. Farrell, business and political leader and one of the founders of the Multnomah Athletic Club, the Rivoli Theater was famous for its vaudeville acts. At the beginning of World War II, with stage acts a thing of the past, it was renamed the Newsreel Theater. The grocery was one of the finest gourmet delicatessens in Portland for 50 years before it was closed in 1969.  In 1971 the property was donated to the city by Mr. and Mrs. William E. Roberts. Built mostly of brick and concrete, the square was designed by Donald Edmundson and Evan Kennedy of the Portland firm of Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall, and was dedicated in December 1973. O'Bryant Square's dominant feature is a bronze fountain in the shape of a rose, fittingly titled <I>Fountain to a Rose</I>. It was made possible through a $28,000 bequest from Donald Card Sloan, who was a prime minister of the Royal Rosarians in 1953. Its inscription reads ""May you find peace in this garden."" The fountain is surrounded by 250 rose bushes and other plants. Beneath the fountain's jets an underground parking garage accommodates 90 cars, making it the first park with parking in the city.

Part of the park is built on a sanitation landfill consisting of 400,000 cubic feet of construction waste material layered with soil. The City of Portland acquired the original 115 acres in 1959. Parks acquired the landfill property from the Donald M. Drake Company at the beginning of 1969 to block its development as an industrial park. The area was believed, at the time, to be one of the few remaining marshland areas in Portland, and local residents were strongly opposed to its development as industrial property.   Portland Parks & Recreation's Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge is a 163-acre complex of meadows, woodlands and wetlands in Portland on the east bank of the Willamette River, just north of the Sellwood Bridge. The refuge is the largest remaining natural area within the lower Willamette River floodplain and provides important habitat for fish and wildlife, including threatened salmon and more than 175 bird species.  Oaks Bottom supports many wildlife species that are considered “special status” - in decline on a regional or statewide scale. These include 44 bird species, three bat species, and one type of amphibian.  Portland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) manages the site as an important habitat area and an inviting place to view wildlife in the heart of the city. The Springwater Corridor Trail (part of the region’s trail network) bisects the western edge of the refuge. A hiking trail and one hike/bike trail connect the refuge with two visitor parking lots and the Sellwood neighborhood to the east.  PP&R created Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge (name changed from Oaks Pioneer Park), the city’s first wildlife refuge, in 1988 after a long history of environmental degradation at the site.

At that time the road to Sandy traversed the Elliott family's property. When they eventually platted their land, they were required to dedicate a right-of-way which passed through the site where the gravel path exists today.  In the 1940s, Henry Troh opened a small airport called Troh’s Skypark on the current-day park site. The airport closed in the 1950s and was replaced by a sand and gravel quarry owned by the Oregon Asphaltic Paving Company. Gravel from the site helped to build the surrounding neighborhood. By 1984 the excavation reached the water table, and groundwater filled the quarry. The quarry was filled in the 1990s, largely with material excavated in the surrounding neighborhoods.  When the surrounding subdivisions were built in the 1970s, the triangular parcel that is now Parklane Park, become a Multnomah County park. Local residents planted many of the trees, and installed red and white striped playground equipment, giving the park its nickname, Candy Cane Park. In 1993, the City of Portland acquired the park from Multnomah County. The 1996 Centennial Neighborhood Plan recommended acquisition of 20 acres to the north, the site of the former gravel quarry. In 2002, the City purchased the three additional parcels from the Oregon Asphaltic Paving Company.

It includes the city's first public rose garden and first community center, a historically designated bandstand, and Portland's second oldest playground.  The park was purchased by the city in 1909 for $60,000 with funds raised in a 1908 bond measure. Originally owned by local businesswoman Liverpool Liz, it had been the site for a roadhouse and racetrack for quarter-mile horse racing. An autopark and campground were also included in the original parcel. Planned by renowned Oregon architects Ellis Lawrence and Ormond R. Bean, the park was a result of Portland's 1912 'City Beautiful' movement. Completed in 1913, much remains of the original features, including the lantern-style streetlights, the stone pillars, vast brickwork, and the nearly 100-year-old fountain in the center of the rose garden.  <i>Disc #4</i>, a bronze sculpture by Jerry Allen, was installed in 1979 along the west side of the park. <p>",,Peninsula Park,,,,,45.568153,-122.673649

Pettygrove, from Portland, Maine, was the owner of Portland's first house, wharf, warehouse, and store.  Pettygrove Park, along with Lovejoy Fountain Park, is in what was known in the 1960s as Portland's urban renewal area. Both Lovejoy and Pettygrove Parks were unnamed until the opening of the parks. The same coin that Mr. Lovejoy and Mr. Pettygrove used to determined whether our city would be named Portland or Boston was flipped to determine which park would be Lovejoy and which would be Pettygrove. Pettygrove Park, 300 yards away from the crashing cascades of water in the Lovejoy Fountain, is composed of serene mounds of grass, trees, and stonework laid out among paths.  In 1979, the Portland Development Commission installed Manuel Izquierdo's muntz bronze sculpture of a reclining woman, <I>The Dreamer</I>.

He paid $24 and a pair of boots. Later the Portland School Board purchased the site and opened Central School, Portland's first real schoolhouse, in 1858. It was moved to an adjoining street in 1883 to make way for the Portland Hotel which occupied the site from 1890-1951. The elegant hotel was torn down and for the next 30 years the site was a parking lot. In 1979, the City acquired the block from Meier & Frank Company who donated $500,000 toward creating an open space. In 1980, a national design competition was held to select a design team. The winning team was led by Portland architect Will Martin, who died in a plane crash not long after the square was dedicated. Located across from its namesake, the historic Pioneer Courthouse, Pioneer Courthouse Square officially opened April 6, 1984, sharing Portland's 133rd birthday.  The Square's features include the Waterfall Fountain, built of granite; sixteen columns with classical pillars topped with carved yellow roses on which crawl pink-and-green spotted bugs; and two brick amphitheaters which provide seats for events. Other pieces of artwork include J. Seward Johnson's <i>Allow Me</i>, a bronze statue of a man holding an umbrella. A signpost lets visitors know how far they would have to travel and in which direction to reach sights such as Walden Pond or Moscow's Red Square. And every noon, the Weather Machine performs, forecasting upcoming weather by displaying one of three metal figures amid a show of mist and flashing lights. Helia, a golden sun, indicates a clear, sunny day; Blue Heron predicts mist, drizzle, and changeable weather; and fierce, open-mouthed Dragon forecasts storms. This whimsical machine also tells the temperature.  In 2017, Pioneer Courthouse Square received major renovations with funding from the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond.

Prior to its destruction, Vanport was the second largest city in Oregon. Vanport was constructed in 1942 to house the thousands of war-time shipbuilders that Henry Kaiser, of Henry Kaiser Industries, had recruited from New York to help with the war effort. Vanport, which was constructed in under a year, was deemed 'The Miracle City.' It had its own post office, nine schools, a fire station, a 400-seat cafeteria, a 785-seat theater, a library, a hospital, fourteen playgrounds, five commercial centers, and a police station staffed by 22 officers.  The problem with this instant city was that the quality of housing and building construction left much to be desired. On Sunday, May 30, 1948, just one day after the general manager of Vanport announced that the city was ""not in any foreseeable danger"" from rising flood waters, a segment of the ring-like dike surrounding the city collapsed. A 12-foot wall of water rushed through the community, wiping out all of the poorly-constructed houses.

The park is comprised of 611 acres of meadowland and forest.  Since time immemorial, the members of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde lived in their traditional territories, which extended over 20 million acres from the Columbia River to the Klamath River, and from the crest of the Coast Range to the crest of the Cascade Range. Their territory included Powell Butte.  Before the turn of the century, the large meadow area was cleared and an orchard planted by the first settlers. In 1925 the City of Portland purchased the land from George Wilson for future water reservoirs, but continued to lease the northeast portion of the property to Henry Anderegg, a farmer and owner of Meadowland Crest Dairy, until 1948 when the farming was discontinued. However, dairy cattle were permitted to graze on the acreage to preserve the pastures. In the mid-1970s, the Water Bureau prepared a development plan for Powell Butte that called for the construction of four 50-million gallon underground reservoirs to be located at the north end of the butte. In 1981, the first reservoir was built. A second 50-million gallon underground reservoir was constructed in 2014. These reservoirs serve as the hub of the Water Bureau's distribution system.   In 1987, the City officially established Powell Butte as a nature park and the park was opened to the public in 1990. The nature park is managed by Portland Parks & Recreation.  Today, miles of trails accommodate hikers, mountain bikers, and horseback riders. Abundant wildlife populates the park, including rabbits, ring-necked pheasants, ground squirrels, raccoons, gray foxes, skunks, bats, chipmunks, coyotes, and black-tailed mule deer. The park is home to many birds of prey with its open meadows, groves of wild hawthorn trees, forested slopes of Western red cedar, and wetlands near Johnson Creek. <p>",,Powell Butte Nature Park,,,,,45.486214,-122.504932

Between 1852-75 the park was an unimproved roadway on the outskirts of the city center; the southern portion up to Jefferson was part of the Great Plank Road. During the 1870s the area became a fashionable residential neighborhood with large Italianate mansions, schools, and churches. In 1877 the first landscaping of these blocks occurred when the City Council authorized florist and landscape designer Louis G. Pfunder to plant 104 Lombardy poplars and elms between Salmon and Hall. The Ladd School opened on the present Portland Art Museum site in 1879. In 1885 the city's first parkkeeper was appointed and a more formal park began to develop. Over the years, much has been added to the park, but there seems to be consensus that the blocks should remain ""a cathedral of trees with a simple floor of grass.""  By the 1880s many lots were subdivided for smaller residences; by the turn of the century, apartment buildings were developed. Lincoln High School was located at Park and Market. This later became the first Portland State University building. The campus from Market to Jackson was established in the 1950s. In 1973 the campus was redesigned and streets closed off.  Today there are twelve South Park Blocks stretching through the heart of downtown Portland. Each park block features artwork. On the block between Hall and Harrison is the most recent addition. Installed in 2004, this work made of white Indiana limestone by Oregon sculptor Donald Wilson is entitled <I>Holon</I>. The word comes from the Greek <I>holos</I> which means whole, entire, complete in all its parts - something that has integrity and identity at the same time as it is a part of a larger system. A block north at Montgomery is the 1973 bronze statue and fountain <I>Farewell to Orpheus</I> by Frederic Littman (1907-79).  In the center of the block between Market and Clay is a granite mosaic sculpture by Oregon artist Paul Sutinen. <I>In the Shadow of the Elm</I>, installed in 1984, depicts the shadow of a tree that may have once existed within the grid of trees in the block. In the center of the block between Columbia and Jefferson is a very different sculpture, also installed in 1984. Comprised of three large granite pillars, <I>Peace Chant</I> is the first known peace memorial in Oregon. Sculptor Steve Gillman wished to express his own advocacy for peace as well as that of the nearby churches. In May 1985 the City Council named this block Peace Plaza.  Between Jefferson and Madison stands an 18-foot-tall bronze equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt by New York sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor (1860-1950), who was known for his western art. Mounted on a 14-foot tall base of California granite, the statue entitled <i>Theodore Roosevelt - Rough Rider</i> portrays the colonel in the actual uniform and accoutrements he wore in his famous ascent of San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War. It was presented to the city by Dr. Henry Waldo Coe. When Dr. Coe was just beginning his medical practice in 1884 in North Dakota, he met the young Roosevelt, who was there trying to regain his health. Their friendship lasted until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Aside from his personal friendship, Coe (who moved to Portland in 1891) admired Roosevelt's politics. It was mostly for this reason that he decided to express his admiration in the form of a public statue. Calvin Coolidge broke ground for the statue in August 1922 and it was unveiled on November 11 of that year. The block was named Roosevelt Square.  The block between Madison and Main was named Lincoln Square because of another donation by Dr. Henry Waldo Coe - a 10-foot bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln on a granite base. Sculpted by George Fite Waters and cast at the famous foundry of Claude Valsuani in France on Lincoln’s birthday in 1927, the statue was unveiled on October 5, 1928.  Located between Main and Salmon is the Shemanski Fountain, given to the city by Joseph Shemanski in 1926 to ""express in small measure gratitude for what the city has done for me."" Shemanski (1869-1951) was a Polish immigrant who started out as a traveling clock salesman before he founded the Eastern Outfitting Co. and became an extremely successful businessman. The triangular structure of cast Oregon sandstone was designed by Carl L. Linde, a local architect whose work included many fine homes, hotels, and apartments. The fountain includes three small, low drinking basins for dogs.  The original design included a large central planter, but after the fountain was erected, Shemanski felt that a sculpture would better complete the graceful cupola. He commissioned Oliver Laurence Barrett, an art professor at the University of Oregon, to create a bronze statue of <I>Rebecca at the Well</I>. It is not clear why Rebecca was chosen, but as the wife of Isaac in the Old Testament known for her hospitality to strangers and kindness to animals, she was a fitting choice.  At the northern end of the block at Salmon sits the Simon Benson Memorial which was constructed in 1959. It was planned by architect Albert E. Doyle while designing the Benson Hotel. A round bronze plaque with a bas relief of Simon Benson, timber baron and philanthropist, is mounted on the curved brick wall with stone benches. He looks out at a drinking fountain which represents one of the 24 bowl fountains that Benson gave to the city in 1912.  The newest park on the Blocks is Simon & Helen Director Park located between Taylor & Morrison. The site was a surface parking lot donated to the city by real estate developer Tom Moyer who also made a substantial contribution toward the design and construction of the park. Another generous contribution was made by philanthropist Jordan Schnitzer who named the park in honor of not only his maternal grandparents, but of all immigrants who helped to build Portland. The design team was led by internationally-renowned landscape architect Laurie Olin whose projects include Bryant Park and Battery Park in New York City and Canary Wharf in London. <p>",,South Park Blocks,,,,,45.512712,-122.684562

679,679,Springwater Corridor,"SE Ivon Street to Boring, Oregon",1990,261.63549611,1,NA,SE,,"The Springwater Corridor is the major southeast segment of the 40-Mile Loop which was inspired by the 1903 Olmsted plan of a parkway and boulevard loop to connect park sites. The eventual developed trail will be over 21 miles long.  For the most part, the trail is well separated from the public road. The route is a scenic one, encompassing wetlands, buttes, agricultural fields and pastures, residential and industrial neighborhoods. Close to Johnson Creek, one of the last free-flowing streams in Portland's urban area, the trail criss-crosses the stream on its course to the Willamette River. The Corridor connects several parks and open spaces including Tideman Johnson Nature Park, Beggars-tick Wildlife Refuge, the I-205 Bike Path, Leach Botanical Garden, Powell Butte Nature Park, and Gresham's Main City Park.  The Springwater Corridor is a multi-use trail. The paved surface is generally 10-12 feet wide with soft shoulders. The hard surface trail is designed to accommodate walkers, joggers, hikers, bicycles, wheelchairs, and strollers. Equestrian use is more common east of I-205 where a separate soft surface path meanders away from the main trail where topography allows.  Most of the wildlife found along the Corridor are those species capable of co-existing with humans. Common species include crow, robin, starling, song sparrow, Bewick's wren, house finch, cedar waxwing, violet-green swallow, belted kingfisher, great blue heron, mallard, wood duck, bushtit, black-capped chickadee, raccoon, opossum, nutria, and mole species. Less developed areas support greater diversity, including black-tailed deer, coyote, deer mouse, vole, bat, western fly-catcher, black-headed grosbeak, orange-crowned warbler, common merganser, and woodpecker. Mountain lions have been sighted.  Himalayan blackberry used to dominate much of the Springwater landscape. It is a non-native plant and so invasive that it chokes out native plants. Over a decade of projects have helped control invasive plants and improve wildlife habitat. Look beneath the PGE transmission lines for new plantings of native shrubs and small trees such as red-osier dogwood, elderberry, Indian plum, and willow. Some of the adjacent natural areas such as Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge and  Beggars-tick Wildlife Refuge feature a wide variety of habitats including open water, shrub/scrub marsh, cattail/smartweed marsh, and forested wetland; Powell Butte Nature Park features open meadow with stands of orchard trees and forested slopes below; and Tideman Johnson Natural Area contains a small riparian woodland.  Johnson Creek and the Springwater Corridor are intertwined, with at least 10 trail bridges over the creek. The creek was once host to abundant native fish populations, including threatened salmon species. Following a series of floods in the mid-1990s, the City of Portland began acquiring properties in the Johnson Creek floodplain. Protected as natural areas, these properties provide flood storage, wildlife habitat, and opportunities for wildlife observation along the Corridor. Ongoing streambank restoration will improve habitat and water quality for threatened fish species.","The Springwater Corridor is a former rail corridor; the Springwater Division Line was developed for rail service in 1903. By 1906, under a joint ownership with Portland General Electric and the Portland Railway Light and Power Company, the line reached its peak usage. By 1910, the company had six electric plants and 161 miles of rail, carrying 16,000 passengers each year on a citywide system.  In addition to passengers, the rail hauled farm produce to Portland markets. It was at this time it acquired the name Springwater Line, probably because of the planned connection to the community of Springwater on the Clackamas River. It was also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line.  Many communities developed along the Springwater Line including Sellwood, Waverley Heights, Eastmoreland, Woodstock, Errol Heights, Lents, Powellhurst-Gilbert, and Pleasant Valley. Towns that developed along the line include Milwaukie, Gresham, Boring, Eagle Creek, Estacada, and Cazadero. During the peak of the railroad era, the Springwater Line was the linkage between these communities. To encourage weekend use, the rail corporation developed destination parks along the line such as Oaks Amusement Park on the banks of the Willamette River in Sellwood. These parks became major attractions, drawing thousands of passengers each weekend. Passenger service was discontinued in 1958.  Much of Springwater Corridor was acquired by the City of Portland in 1990, with additional acquisitions by Metro in the following years. Master planning for the Corridor began in 1991, and included input from citizens, agencies, organizations, and municipalities, including Portland Department of Transportation; Oregon Department of Transportation; the cities of Gresham and Milwaukie; Metro; Clackamas and Multnomah counties; the 40 Mile Loop Land Trust; and the Johnson Creek Corridor Committee. Construction of the initial Portland segment was completed September 1996. The trail through Gresham was built in 1996 and an additional mile east of Gresham was built in 2000. With the completion of a 3-mile segment from SE Ivon to SE Umatilla Streets (known as Springwater on the Willamette) in 2005, the part of the trail within Portland is nearly complete.",,Springwater Corridor,,,,,45.474008,-122.526733

793,793,Terwilliger Parkway,SW 6th Avenue - Sheridan Street to Slavin Street,1912,102.81563558,1,97201,SW,,,"The construction of Terwilliger Boulevard was first mentioned in landscape architect John C. Olmsted's 1903 report to the Portland Park Board. Olmsted envisioned a comprehensive system of parks and parkways for all of Portland - with Terwilliger Blvd, or South Hillside Parkway as he called it, becoming the principal pleasure drive leading south from the city. John and his stepbrother, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., felt that boulevards and parkways were important additions to cities and added a feeling of civility to movement in an urban area. Of the four proposed parkway systems, Terwilliger is the only one completed for public use and utilized as envisioned by its planners.  The parkway got its name from the James Terwilliger family. James came to Oregon in 1845, built a log cabin at what is now SW First and Morrison St, and opened a blacksmith shop. He traded an eastside land claim for a horse, then traded that horse for 640 acres in Portland's west hills. In 1854, he, his wife, and some adjacent landholders donated a total of 10 acres that became the city cemetery. James died in 1892 and his heirs donated 19.24 acres in the form of a right-of-way through the Terwilliger property in 1909 as a part of the development of Terwilliger Blvd. The deeds stated that the donated land was intended to form part of the ""Park and Boulevard System of the City of Portland.""   Nothing was done to develop the parkway until 1909 when Portland lawyer Joseph Simon became mayor. By the end of his two-year term, the City had a design for the parkway, received gifts of land, purchased 2.84 acres and graded the portion between Hamilton and Slavin Roads. The 200-foot right-of-way was designed to ensure that no buildings would be built to obstruct the views. The formal dedication was held on August 4, 1914, and more than 200 autos paraded along the boulevard. The road was illuminated by electric lights, making the road seem ""as light as day.""  There was a great deal of discussion in 1917 regarding the surface of the roadway. It was not completely paved and the surface had begun to deteriorate. The boulevard had become one of the best routes between downtown and the southwest, and some people wanted to open Terwilliger to commercial traffic. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (which had donated 41.2 acres) and the heirs of James Terwilliger threatened to reclaim the right-of-way. The City attorney pointed out that much of the land was given expressly to ""be used forever as a boulevard and parkway for the benefit and use of the public,"" and if the city failed in this or in the improvement of the parkway, the land would immediately revert to those granting the gift. The City paved the road within a year.  In 1959, the City created a special design zone for the parkway to retain its ""heavily wooded character."" In 1983 the City Council enacted the Terwilliger Parkway Design Guidelines and the Terwilliger Parkway Corridor Plan to preserve and protect this urban treasure from growing development.  A 1.93-acre parcel, located in the heart of Terwilliger Parkway, was owned by Charles and Thelma Norris. A longtime Portland resident and school teacher, Mrs. Norris was a charter member of the American Rhododendron Society. She and her husband planted dozens of rhododendrons on the property. When she died in 1992, she bequeathed the property to Portland Parks & Recreation. <p>",,Terwilliger Parkway,,,,,45.491406,-122.683681

In 2012, the center was renamed in honor of Charles Jordan, Portland’s first African-American City Commissioner and Portland Parks & Recreation Director. He was the force behind Portland landmarks such as Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, Delta Park, and Southwest Community Center. On the national stage, Charles Jordan broadened the agenda of the environmental movement and land conservation to make it more inclusive. He is known for his groundbreaking approach to putting people - particularly people of color - at the heart of the American Conservation Movement. <p>",5038233631,Charles Jordan Community Center,,http://www.CMCpdxcom/CharlesJordanCC,,,45.587687,-122.711366

Water drips from one bronze pan to another, and gargoyles around the base spout water. Commissioned by the city for $400 in 1891, the cast iron fountain was created by John (Hans) Staehli, a Swiss woodcarver, who designed it after a Renaissance fountain. Originally the fountain was painted white and was topped by a cast iron figure of a boy holding a staff from which water spouted. At some  point over the years, the staff disappeared. The last known record of it was in 1912 when Willis McElroy's band was photographed in the nearby bandstand. In the 1920s, during a spell of freezing weather, water left in the fountain expanded and destroyed the figure of the boy. It was not replaced. In 1960, the fountain was in such disrepair that the city was ready to scrap it. Local longshoreman Francis J. Murnane, whose avocation was the preservation of historic buildings and objects, appealed to Mayor Terry Schrunk and the park bureau was authorized to begin restoration. Much of the original decoration had disappeared so replicas were created from existing pieces for $450. With the additional costs of reassembly and installation, the total came to a little over $1,772 - a good investment!  Placed at the entrance to the park, the Lewis and Clark Memorial is a 34-foot, rectangular granite shaft with each side bearing a large bronze replica of the great seals of the States of Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Idaho which comprised the Northwest Territory. This was the only portion of the United States that was acquired by discovery and therefore was never under a foreign flag. President Theodore Roosevelt laid the foundation stone on May 21, 1903. He was assisted by the monument's designer, Portland stonecutter Otto Schumann. The memorial was completed in 1908.  <I>Coming of the White Man</I> was given to the city by the heirs of David P. Thompson, an early Portland mayor and donor of the elk statue on Main between the Plaza Blocks. Completed in 1904, this bronze statue, sculpted by  Hermon Atkins MacNeil and cast by Bureau Brothers Foundry in Los Angeles, features two Native Americans standing on a block of rough-hewn native stone. Facing eastward, they look down upon the route that ox teams trudged bringing settlers to this part of the country. The older of the two is said to represent Chief Multnomah of the Multnomah people. At some point, the oak branch held by the younger figure was broken off.  A bronze statue of Sacajawea holding her son Jean-Baptiste is located near the Chiming Fountain. In commemoration of the heroic Shoshone Indian woman who helped lead the Lewis and Clark explorers through the mountains of the west, the statue was unveiled on July 7, 1905 at the Lewis and Clark Centennial. Among those present at the event were Susan B. Anthony, Abigail Scott Duniway, and Eva Emery Dye. The project was promoted and paid for by subscriptions solicited nationwide by a group of Portland women headed by Mrs. Sarah Evans. The committee commissioned  Alice Cooper of Denver, at that time an understudy of Lorado Taft, to sculpt the statue. It was cast in New York and required 14 tons of copper which came from the Sweden mine, just below Mt St Helens. The copper was donated by Dr. Henry Waldo Coe of Portland. In April 1906, the statue was placed in its current location in Washington Park. Its inscription reads, ""Erected by the women of the United States in memory of the only woman in the Lewis & Clark expedition, and in honor of the pioneer mother of Oregon.""  Located near the corner of Washington Way & Wright, the Oregon Holocaust Memorial was dedicated on August 29, 2004. The memorial features a stone bench adorned with wrought-iron gating, screened from the street by rhododendron bushes. The bench sits behind a circular, cobblestoned area - simulating a town square. During the Holocaust, many Jewish families were gathered in town squares before being loaded onto trains and taken to concentration camps. The square contains scattered bronzes of shoes, glasses, a suitcase, and other items to represent everyday objects that were left behind. A European-style, cobblestone walkway with inlaid granite bars, simulating railroad tracks, leads to a wall of history panels - giant, stone placards that offer a brief history of the Holocaust and quotes from Holocaust survivors. At the end of the wall is the soil vault panel. Buried below the panel are interred soil and ash from six killing-center camps of the Holocaust - Chelmno, Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Majdanek, and Auschwitz-Birkenau. The back of the wall is engraved with the names of people who died in the camps, followed by the names of their surviving relatives in Oregon and SW Washington. <a href=""http://ohrconline.org/"" target=""_blank"">More information</a> on the Holocaust Memorial.","Washington Park is one of the oldest parks in Portland. The city purchased the original 40.78 acres in 1871 from Amos N. King for the then high price of $32,624. Many people questioned the purchase given that the site was thick with brush and timber, and cougar roamed the hills.  City Park, as Washington Park was originally known until 1912, was developed slowly. In June 1885, the city hired Charles M. Myers as its first park keeper. A native of Germany and a seaman, Myers had no formal training but enthusiastically began to develop the park by using his memories of European parks as a guide. By 1900, the park had developed from a wilderness to a place of drives, walkways, formal plantings, lawns, clipped hedges, and ornamental flower displays. In 1903, John C. Olmsted toured Portland and recommended changes of lasting usefulness to the park: he advised changing the name from City Park to one of more distinction, moving the main entrance to Park Place, separating vehicular traffic from foot traffic, and restoring some of the formally planted areas to their natural beauty with native shrubs and ground cover.  The last major land addition to Washington Park was made in 1922 when the entire 160-acre County Poor Farm was transferred to the Park Bureau. The southern half of the property was developed into the 9-hole West Hills Golf Course. The remainder was designated as a municipal arboretum in 1928.  Washington Park was also the site of Portland's first zoo, which Dr. Richard B. Knight began as an animal attraction in the mid-1880s. Dr. Knight was an English-born seaman who became a pharmacist upon moving to Portland. He purchased two bears (a grizzly named Grace and a brown bear named Brownie) along with other animals from his seafaring friends and exhibited them on a vacant lot next to his downtown pharmacy. By 1887, the popular collection had outgrown its quarters, so Dr. Knight donated the animals to the city for a zoo. The animals were moved to the area near the current reservoirs. The collection grew rapidly. By 1894 there were about 300 specimens, mostly North American species plus some monkeys, a kangaroo, and some foreign birds. The city park keeper, Charles Myers, became the zookeeper as well. He constructed the bear pit, which is believed to have been the first sunken, barless cage anywhere in the world. In 1925, the zoo moved to a higher location, the present site of the Japanese Garden. The zoo opened at its present location in 1959 and in the 1960s its management was transferred to Metro.  The Rotary Club of Portland spearheaded a $2 million fund-raising effort that culminated in the 1995 construction of the Rose Garden Children's Park, a popular, accessible play area for children of all ages. <p>",,Washington Park,http://explorewashingtonpark.org/parking,,,,45.516287,-122.707169

In 1924, the property was used as golf links, likely in conjunction with what is today known as Eastmoreland Golf Course. Prior to the 1920s, dating back as far as 1852, the property was used as farmland. By the 1930s, the site east of the subdivision had been converted from a wetland to serve time as a dairy, brickyard, and airstrip known as Broomfield Field (named after a Reed College Graduate by the name of Hugh Broomfield who lost his life over German Lines in WWI while on a recon mission.) However, as development increased, residents requested that these empty fields be turned into a city park.  In 1935, the City Planning Commission recommended development of recreational amenities for the nearby residents and ""the improved appearance and traffic safety of McLoughlin Boulevard as a major traffic freeway entrance to the city."" In January 1936, the City of Portland purchased the 45-acre parcel called Fairways Addition from Oregon Iron & Steel Co., a business owned by the Ladd Estate Co. After purchasing the land, the City of Portland immediately commissioned Francis Benedict Jacobberger to create a <i>Study Sketch and Preliminary Layout for the West Moreland Recreation Park</i>. F. B. Jacobberger was the son of Joseph Jacobberger, a principal of the architecture firm Jacobberger & Smith, founded in 1912. From 1921, the younger Jacobberger worked as a draftsman in his father’s office; when the elder Jacobberger died in 1930, Francis Jacobberger continued the firm in his own name.  As initially conceived, the park included (from roughly north to south) a park office and restroom building, outdoor handball courts, a roller-skating rink, basketball courts, twelve tennis courts, two children’s play areas, two picnic parks, a model yacht lagoon, bowling greens, a horseshoe pitching area, a fly-casting pond with nearby dry-casting area and fly-caster’s club house, four baseball diamonds, two football fields, a lacrosse field, a soccer field, various portable bleachers, and dressing rooms. Water from Crystal Springs, which entered the park at the north end, was to feed both the model yacht lagoon and the casting pond before flowing through to the south end of the park. Both the lagoon and pond were also intended for use as ice-skating rinks in the colder winter months.  A partnership between the City of Portland and the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) helped escalate the park’s construction. Viewed as an important opportunity to employ laborers during the rough economic times following the Great Depression, park construction focused on manual labor in order to employ the greatest number of people. The fly-casting pond, specifically, was hand excavated, and was one of the first features completed at the park. By August 1936, the pond was home to the 28th Annual International Casting competition.  By the end of the first year of construction, projects at West Moreland (now Westmoreland) Park included the aforementioned casting pond, as well as the beginnings of the model yacht lagoon. In spite of ""the persistence of farmed fields along the southern and northern portion"" of the park project, several ball fields in the southwestern portion of the park were also under construction. Of particular note was concern regarding field drainage, which required additional attention in the form of hand-dug trenches topped with fine sand and/or gravel that connected to the creek through sewer pipes. (The need for additional drainage is not surprising given the original marshy topography of the Crystal Springs watershed as it flowed through the park.) Rustic bridges, constructed from local trees, were built for pedestrian crossings to span Crystal Springs Creek; the use of local materials in a rustic style was typical of WPA construction, especially for park-like settings.  In spite of the progress, the park project was closed due to lack of funds in approximately June 1937.11 By April 1939, however, interest in restarting the project was evident, and the project as reopened on July 26 that year. The work to date had varied slightly from the original study sketch, and some features, notably the model yacht lagoon, were constructed ahead of schedule to provide employment for the largest number of men.  A major variation to the original design was the manner in which the casting pond received water from Crystal Springs. As initially designed, water would flow from the north end of the park, through the model yacht lagoon, into the casting pond, and then south through the park along the natural stream channel. However, as construction progressed, it became apparent that this course would not work, as the elevation of the fly-casting pool was higher than that of the creek. To fill the pool, water was taken from a point 3,000 feet northwest (within Eastmoreland Golf Course). The water through the lagoon continued along the natural streambed without further diversion.  The West Moreland Park project reopened on July 26, 1939, with approximately 300 men employed via the WPA for a total federal contribution of around $225,000. The casting-pond floor was concreted, the ball fields were graded, and at least one wood vehicular bridge was constructed across Crystal Springs Creek. Also in 1939, local druggist Nick Sckavone advocated for construction of an adult baseball stadium, which was constructed in 1942 and, in 1955, was renamed Sckavone Field in his honor (now Sckavone Stadium).  In 1945, lawn bowling facilities were constructed; the grass playing surface is also used croquet and the gravel playing surface is used for petanque. A restroom/picnic shelter, originally called the Field House, was built in 1949. The model yacht lagoon, as initially constructed, included a sloped soil shoreline with native plantings. In 1952, the lagoon was re-formed into the wading pool, a concrete-lined structure in roughly the same alignment as the previous water feature. Also during this time, Crystal Springs Creek appears to have been channelized through the length of the park, using both poured concrete and concrete stone blocks. In later years and into the present day, the persistent presence of waterfowl in the pool caused a change in the naming convention, with the wading pool now commonly referred to as the duck pond.  Installed in 1979, <i>Uroboros</i>, the name for an ancient Egyptian and Greek symbol that depicts a snake that bites its own tail, was created by Charles Kibby.  During the 1940s the first incidents of Crystal Springs overflowing its banks were documented. In 1974 it was reported that the concrete walls which channelized Crystal Springs Creek were failing. Also, in the 1970s, complaints were registered about ducks and geese creating menacing situations, dogs running loose, and parking problems. During the 1980s, swimming in the casting pond and Crystal Springs became a concern for local residents and PP&R staff because of water quality and safety issues. From 1996 to 1998, periodic flooding in the park inundated picnic areas, playgrounds, and paths. When the waters finally receded, leaving behind damaged stream edges and dying trees, questions about the future of the creek and park arose.  In order to address these issues, a master planning process for the park, with community input, began in 2002; a final plan was approved in 2003. <p>",,Westmoreland Park,,,,,45.469718,-122.640867

864,864,Woodlawn Community Garden,7098 NE 11th Avenue,1998,0.41940226,1,97211,NE,,,"In 1996, a committee involving Woodlawn Neighborhood Association (WNA) members and Woodlawn Elementary School teachers began meeting to plan the creation of a community garden. Leslie Pohl-Kosbau, the founder and Director of Community Gardens for Portland Parks & Recreation (PP&R) from 1975 to 2011, had worked with the WNA for years on this project. In November 1996, Portland Public Schools gave permission to start the garden on a parcel of land between the school and Woodlawn Park. This site was specifically chosen for its visibility and to encourage more community involvement. Initial funding for the project included a $16,000 grant from the Bureau of Housing & Community Development and a grant from the Edible Classrooms Project of the Alice Waters Foundation.   A groundbreaking ceremony was held at the garden site on May 22, 1997. That fall, the Park Trust Fund provided $8,100 for construction drawings of the garden. A soil test was conducted in November; that same month, PP&R installed the water meter and irrigation system.   The garden officially opened on May 8, 1998. Alice Waters was a special guest and featured speaker. In addition to the Garden Classroom, there were seventeen community garden plots. The next day, a fundraising group called 16 Girls and a Guy held “From the Ground Up,” a silent auction/dinner benefit for the garden at Water’s Restaurant in downtown Portland. This event raised nearly $40,000 to cover major garden construction costs including excavation, berm construction, and concrete work.  In October 1999, Alice Waters was back at Atwater’s for a book signing reception and dinner for her newest book, Chez Panisse Café Cookbook. Proceeds from this event helped fund the Garden Classroom, a program to teach children about healthy eating through the planting, tending, and harvesting of a garden plot. From 2008 to 2012, the community garden was home to a children’s garden program, which was launched in collaboration with the Friends of Portland Community Gardens, the Portland Trail Blazers, and Fred Meyer.   In August 2007, AVEENO® and Organic Gardening provided funding for the installation of a Thai Jar rainwater-harvesting cistern, the first of its kind in the northwestern United States. In addition to the cistern, the project included a new covered arbor that serves as a gathering and teaching space, flower boxes around the tool shed, roses for the perennial beds, and a new picnic table. At present, the Thai Jar has several cracks and is (unfortunately) in need of repair.   There are currently forty-three plots in the Woodlawn Community Garden. One plot is dedicated to Produce for People; everything grown there is donated to the St. Andrew Church food pantry on NE Alberta Street. In the summer, we also have a “free produce box” attached to the park side of the fence; neighbors strolling by can help themselves! Teachers and students from Woodlawn Elementary School continue to have a plot and also use the garden as a “classroom” for art and other projects. The garden has communal raspberries, strawberries, herbs, and fruit trees including a pear and a fig, and a native plant habitat area. As of 2019, there is now an active mason bee house, too.   Fun fact: In 2008, President Bill Clinton and his daughter Chelsea were campaigning for Hillary and visited the Woodlawn Community Garden. They pulled weeds and posed for photographs with gardeners and neighborhood residents.",5038231612,Woodlawn Community Garden,,PDXcommunitygardens,,,45.574152,-122.653165

Portland's 25-year dream of reclaiming its waterfront was realized with the completion of South Waterfront Park which runs 1,000 feet along the bank of the Willamette River. Unique along the downtown riverfront, South Waterfront Park provides direct public access to the river throughout the year.  Developed primarily to anchor the commercial and residential property built in the mid-1990s, the park also served to stem any further erosion of the river bank that occurred during the 1996 winter flood. Once the site of a lumber mill and the City's steam plant, the park was designed by the landscape architectural firm of Walker Macy. The esplanade meanders the full length of the riverbank, mirroring the course of the river. Historically the street grid of Portland extended directly to the river's edge to facilitate access and commerce. Today the city's block grid extends through South Waterfront Park to the water's edge via walkways leading to overlooks with views of the river, the city, Mt Hood, and Mt St Helens. The form of the river is carried up into the park via the flowing forms of the site grading and planting, as well as a pair of boulder-lined pathways sculpted into the riverbank leading to a natural silty beach that is exposed at the base of these pathways during periods of low water.  The basalt, concrete, and steel sculpture by Mathieu Gregoire, <I>River Shift</I>, reflects the historical progression of the riverbank with his use of local basalt and remnants of the concrete piers and reinforcements excavated from the old waterfront site.  As the basalt pieces progress from berm to river, they tip over, so that the concrete below becomes exposed and the basalt becomes submerged and eventually disappears. The concrete is cut in various places to expose the river rock aggregate inside as well as the old embedded wood piers, and some of the heavy steel reinforcement emerges like roots. <p>",,South Waterfront Park,,,,,45.507898,-122.672186

PP&R hosted several community meetings inviting residents to help design the park. The neighbors persuaded the city to expand the plans to include two lots.

In 1939, $197,299 was allocated by the City to transform the area into a park; $42,000 was used to build the baseball field. The very first baseball season got underway in 1940 and since that time, Westmoreland Baseball Park has been the launching ground for several professional careers and championship teams. In 1943, the City added a wooden stadium. The field needed lights, but city funds were not available. Not deterred, Sckavone and the Portland Amatuer Baseball Association (PABA), which he founded, organized a benefit baseball game at the old Vaughn Street Park, after which Sckavone handed the City a check for $2,000. Impressed by this show of support, the City budgeted the additional $11,000 and new lights were installed in 1944. In 1955, the facility was renamed Sckavone Field in honor of the man who was so instrumental in its creation.

In 1888, Georgiana Burton Pittock, wife of publisher Henry Pittock, invited her friends and neighbors to exhibit their roses in a tent set up in her garden; thus the Portland Rose Society was established.  Madame Caroline Testout was a late 19th century French dressmaker from Grenoble, the proprietor of fashionable salons in London and Paris. She regularly purchased silks from Lyon, which was an important center for rose breeding. The nurseryman Joseph Pernet-Ducher was called 'The Wizard of Lyon' due to his success in developing hybrid tea roses. Madame Testout was an astute businesswoman and understood the value of good publicity. She asked Perner-Ducher to name one of his new roses after her. He agreed, but considered her choice of seedling to be mediocre. The 'Madame Caroline Testout' rose made its debut at the salon's 1890 spring fashion show. It was not strong on scent, but became an immediate success with Madame Testout's well to do customers as well as the gardening public for its abundant silky, rose-pink flowers. The new variety's popularity spread to America, and in Portland, nearly half a million bushes of 'Caroline Testout' were planted along the sidewalks. By 1905 Portland had 200 miles of rose-bordered streets which helped attract visitors to the Lewis and Clark Centennial celebration. Portland came to be known as the 'City of Roses'.  In 1915 Jesse A. Currey, rose hobbyist and Sunday editor of the <i>Oregon Journal</i>, convinced city officials to institute a rose test garden to serve as a safe haven during World War I for hybrid roses grown in Europe. Rose lovers feared that these unique plants would be destroyed in the bombings. The Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917 and by early 1918, hybridists from England began to send roses. In 1921 Florence Holmes Gerke, the landscape architect for the city of Portland, was charged with designing the International Rose Test Garden and the amphitheatre. The garden was dedicated in June 1924. Currey was appointed as the garden's first rose curator and served in that capacity until his death in 1927.  Part of the original design, the <b>Royal Rosarian Garden</b> is home to the namesake roses of all past Prime Ministers of the Royal Rosarians, a civic group which serves as the official greeters and goodwill ambassadors for the City of Portland. Founded in 1912, the Order of Royal Rosarians modeled their mythical 'Realm of Rosaria' after the government of England’s King Henry VII, whose rise to the throne in 1485 ended the War of the Roses. Members are 'knighted' into the organization under their chosen variety of rose, which is then their 'namesake' rose. The garden also features a stone bench honoring Jesse Currey.  In 1945, the <b>Shakespeare Garden</b>, located at Crystal Springs Lake in southeast Portland, was moved to Washington Park to allow for expansion of Eastmoreland Golf Course. Designed by Glenn Stanton and Florence Gerke, it was originally intended to include only herbs, trees, and flowers mentioned in William Shakespeare's plays. The garden continues to honor the Bard with roses named after characters in his plays. The focal point of the garden is the Shakespeare Memorial, a brick wall with a plaque featuring Shakespeare’s image and his quote, ""Of all flowers methinks a rose is best."" Donated by the LaBarre Shakespeare Club, it was dedicated on April 23, 1946 - the 382nd anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. In 1957 the club added a sundial to the garden.  In 1967, rose curator Rudolph Kalmbach wanted to establish a formal  garden featuring Gold Award roses. (In 1919 the City of Portland issued its first annual Gold Award for the best new rose variety.)  With the support of the Portland Rose Society, Wallace Kay Huntington was selected to design the garden which was dedicated in June 1970. In 1991, the Portland Rose Society donated the pavilion which overlooks these award-winning roses.  Established in 1975, the <b>Miniature Rose Garden</b> is one of only six testing grounds for the American Rose Society (ARS) miniature rose test program. The national annual winners from both ARS and AARS associations are displayed in the middle of the garden along the center aisle.  Set in a sunken section on the upper level of the garden, the Frank  Beach Memorial Fountain was dedicated in June 1975. The stainless steel sculpture, titled <i>Water Sculpture</i>, was designed and built by Oregon artist Lee Kelly. The fountain was a gift from the Beach family to honor their father, Frank Edwin Beach (1853-1934), the man who is said to have christened Portland the 'City of Roses' and who first proposed the annual Rose Festival.  <b>Awards</b> The award called <I>Portland’s Best Rose</I> was established in 1996. Rose experts from around the world attend a one-day judging in June and select the best rose that day from thousands of submissions. Portland remains the only North American city to issue such an award.  In 2006, the International Rose Test Garden received <i>The Garden of Excellence Award</i> from the World Federation of Rose Societies. <p>  In 2017, the Garden’s Centennial anniversary, a construction project funded by the 2014 Parks Replacement Bond removed ADA accessibility barriers from the main promenade within the Rose Garden and improved connections to the parking lot.",,International Rose Test Garden - Washington Park,http://washingtonparkpdx.org/parking/,,,,45.519255,-122.705416

He was a consummate businessman, and took ownership of the weekly Oregonian in 1860, the same year he married 15-year-old Georgiana Martin Burton of Missouri, only seven years after arriving on the wagon train from Pennsylvania. He went on to build an empire incorporating real estate, banking, railroads, steamboats, sheep ranching, silver mining, and a pulp and paper industry.  Georgiana loved gardening and kept a terraced flower garden filled with many kinds of flowers. She started the tradition of Portland's annual Rose Festival. In the community, she dedicated herself to the lives of woman and children. She helped found the Ladies Relief Society in 1867 and played a key role in building the Martha Washington home for single working women.

In 1998, a conceptual plan for the new parks and open spaces was proposed by the Tanner Creek & Water Feature Steering Committee and approved by City Council. Those recommendations served as a point of departure for planning the district's parks.  In June 1999, Peter Walker & Partners, a landscape architecture firm, was retained to provide concepts for three new parks between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues in the River District. They developed and refined plans for the parks with input from a Project Steering Committee and two public workshops. The final plan is characterized by a series of recurring elements which strengthen the connection between each of the three parks.  Located between NW Johnson and Kearney, Jamison Square was the first to be developed. It is named in honor of William Jamison, whose presence was pivotal in the development of the River District. He was an exceptional person in his ability to influence and connect with a wide variety of people. His personal magnetism, in addition to the size and scope of his art gallery, drew many people into the Pearl District.

For the next two years, they applied for grants, recruited volunteers, solicited donations from local businesses, filed for city permits, and negotiated a lease with Portland Public Schools to prevent the land from being sold. In total, the group received $60,000 in grants and $10,000 in fundraising. Donated materials were worth an estimated $40,000. The garden opened in September 2005.  The Rigler Peace Garden, as it was unofficially named by the group of volunteers who built it, is used for both community gardening and for education.

To find out how you can help at your neighborhood park, call 503-823-5121.","What is now known as the Pearl District was once a wetland and lake fed by streams that flowed down from the nearby hills in southwest Portland. These wooded hillsides provided a natural filter for the streams, cleansing the water as it made its way to the Willamette River. The springs from Tanner Creek, named for the tannery built by pioneer Daniel Lownsdale in 1845, flowed into the shallow basin of Couch Lake, now the area surrounding Tanner Springs Park. As the population of Portland grew in the late 19th century, Tanner Creek was rerouted through an underground system of pipes to the Willamette River. The lake and the surrounding wetland were eventually filled to make way for warehouses and rail yards which in turn were replaced by residences, shops, and public spaces. Today, the park sits about 20 feet above the former lake surface.  From the beginning of the planning efforts for the Pearl District in the early 1990s, the creation of a network of open spaces was an important goal of both the neighborhood and the City. In 1998, a conceptual plan for the new parks and open spaces was proposed by the Tanner Creek and Water Feature Steering Committee and approved by City Council. Those recommendations served as a point of departure for planning the district's parks.  In June 1999, Peter Walker & Partners, a landscape architecture firm, was retained to provide concepts for three new parks between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues in the River District. They developed and refined plans for the parks with input from a Project Steering Committee and two public workshops. The final plan is characterized by a series of recurring elements which strengthen the connection between each of the three parks. Jamison Square was the first to be developed.  North Park Square was the working name given the second block to be developed. Planning for this park began in early 2003. Atelier Dreiseitl, a renowned German design firm, and GreenWorks, P.C., an award-winning, local landscape architecture firm, were selected to design the park. A series of community workshops were held between January and June 2003, allowing the public to participate in the design process. After committee review, the name Tanner Springs was adopted in April 2005. The springs connect the park to Tanner Creek that at one time flowed openly through this area; today it flows through large pipes beneath the city streets. Since the design of the park attempts to recapture the area's past with its native wetlands and flowing runnels, the name is fitting.  The Artwall runs along the east edge of the park. It is composed of 368 railroad tracks set on end and integrates 99 pieces of fused glass inset with images of dragonflies, spiders, amphibians, and insects. The images were hand-painted by Herbert Dreiseitl directly onto Portland glass, which was then fused and melted to achieve the final effect. <p>",,Tanner Springs Park,,,,,45.531161,-122.681973

Elizabeth Caruthers was born in Tennessee. In 1816 she married Joe Thomas, and the couple had one son. She later rejected her married name, and in 1847 she and the son, Finice Caruthers, came to Oregon. They settled here on the banks of the river near the abandoned 1842 Johnson cabin. Under the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, they claimed this 640-acre section. Elizabeth died in 1857 and Finice in 1860. Their deaths, without wills or heirs, led to fraudulent claims and litigation, which reached the United States Supreme Court in 1868. There the matter was resolved in a landmark decision ruling that, under the 1850 Donation Act, a woman - married or not - had the same property rights as a man. SW Caruthers Street, SE Caruthers Street, and Caruthers Creek in Marquam Gulch also reflect the family's prominence in the early history of Portland.  Prior to European contact, over 50,000 Native Americans lived in the Portland area and hundreds of thousands of Native Americans came to trade along the river. During the time of early land agreements and negotiations with local tribes, the South Waterfront area became a relocation camp for Native Americans who were removed from other parts of the city.

The City of Portland's South Waterfront Plan envisioned a system of parks working together to enliven the neighborhood, stimulate development activity in the area, and provide for the recreational needs of area residents. These projects are important because they set the tone for the quality of open space in the district.   <b>Environmental Requirements:</b> At the direction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the State of Oregon Division of State Lands (DSL) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the design for the riverbank restoration included habitat in the form of a shallow water bench to provide shelter for juvenile fish, and adjacent riparian plantings. Working jointly with the Corps of Engineers, Oregon DSL, NMFS, Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, and the City’s Bureau of Environmental Services, a hybrid concept was developed in summer 2010 that met public and agency needs.  <b>Phasing</b> After nearly 10 years of planning, review and design by local, state, and federal agencies, the Greenway Project was permitted in June 2012.  Construction was broken into two phases. Phase 1 included Riverbank Restoration - removal of contaminated soil, installation of retaining walls, riparian habitat, and the osprey pole, plus repair of areas of the site that were damaged during construction. Phase 2 included completion of the Upland Park, with pedestrian and bicycle paths, seating, lighting, lawns, and the public art piece.   <b>Public Art</b> Named ""Cradle"", the public art installed along the Greenway includes 3 trees laid on their sides upon concrete pods near the Curry Street overlook.
