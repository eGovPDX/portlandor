<p>Personnel Training Order (PTO): A written directive relating to training assignments, issued at the Bureau level, and authorized by the RU manager.</p>
<p>The person requesting a PTO will submit the request on a Training Application. As the authority to publish a PTO comes from the RU manager, once it is signed by the manager, it serves as the PTO authorizing the applicant&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>Any training offered outside the Bureau, that would normally be paid for through the use of discretionary training and education funds and that is not a conference, command or supervisory development seminar directed by the Chief of Police&rsquo;s office, must have the following information included with the application:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;A clear endorsement by each level of the requesting member&rsquo;s chain of command.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;A paragraph indicating the justification for the member&rsquo;s training endorsed by the RU manager.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If appropriate, a paragraph indicating how the information gleaned will be shared in the organization.</p>
<p>The RU manager will sign the PTO. The affected RU will be responsible for issuing and distributing the PTO to the applicant, Training Division, Fiscal Services, and the Court Coordinator, if applicable.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/525134

<p><strong>POLICY (021.00)</strong></p>
<p>The following states the Bureau&rsquo;s adopted Human Goals:</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau, which exists to protect and serve the community, must always be guided by the principle that the individual has infinite dignity and worth. In all that we do, we must show respect for the citizens we serve, and for the men and women of the Portland Police Bureau, recognizing and encouraging their individual needs, aspirations and capabilities.</p>
<p>The attainment of these goals requires that we strive to:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Attract to the Police Bureau a diverse group of individuals with ability, dedication, and capacity for growth.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Provide the opportunity for everyone to rise to as high a level of responsibility and interest as desired, dependent only on that individual&rsquo;s talent, diligence and commitment.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Train and support Bureau members to be the best they can be.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Make the Portland Police Bureau a model of equal opportunity for all regardless of race, color, sex, religion, age, national origin, marital status, sexual orientation or physical challenge.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; Contribute to the improvement of our community, especially to those citizens in need, by maximizing our human resources while maintaining full effectiveness in the performance of our primary mission: service to the community.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/525131

<p><strong>POLICY (024.00)</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau employs a community-based style of policing that encourages citizen participation in crime reduction and greater coordination with other service providers to address crime-related problems. Bureau members are one of the catalysts who bring the necessary resources to bear on community safety needs throughout Portland.</p>
<p>By strengthening the partnership among citizens, police, neighborhood and business communities, and public and private agencies, the Portland Police Bureau expects a reduction in the fear of and occurrence of crime through a resolution of immediate community safety problems and identification of root causes of crime and disorder. Citizens and Bureau members mutually participate in, and are responsible for, strategy design and problem solving that emphasizes comprehensive responses to criminal incidents. Problem solving is joint empowerment of police and citizens to coordinate public and private resources to resolve community problems. Police members take a vested interest in, and are sensitive to, the cultural and ethnic diversity of the areas they serve.</p>
<p>The Bureau is committed to fostering an organizational climate that rewards its employees for initiative, innovation, citizen involvement and consensus building in problem resolution. The Bureau encourages decentralization of resources to the most appropriate level in the organization and community.</p>
<p>All Bureau members are expected to maintain a sustained and dedicated service orientation with all citizens to assure the peace and safety of our community. The organizational values (integrity, compassion, accountability, respect, excellence, service) must be the driving force in all of our decisions.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/525130

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This policy is to establish a standardized system for the storage of all general Bureau files.<strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This filing system will apply to all Bureau and Responsibility Unit (RU) files. This system will not include crime and information files maintained by specialized units, (i.e., Drugs and Vice, Internal Affairs, etc.). In addition, the personal files of managers are not affected.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Bureau and RU files are organized information maintained by each RU containing written material related to policy and procedures in the directives and other information pertinent to the RU&rsquo;s operation. The material contained within these files may also contain correspondence, research data, brochures, inter-agency information, visual aids, training information, intelligence notes or any information relevant to the operation of the RU. Files will be reviewed and purged each year during the month of January.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Section Numbers: </strong></p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The filing system incorporates numbered tabbed file dividers. The following numbered tabs correspond to the directives&rsquo; section numbering system:</p>
<p>3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manual Organization/Filing Manual</p>
<p>3.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureau Organization</p>
<p>3.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personnel/General Administration</p>
<p>3.1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conduct/Discipline/Grievances</p>
<p>3.1.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disability/Injury/Retirement</p>
<p>3.1.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contracts/Labor</p>
<p>3.1.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field Operations</p>
<p>3.1.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 700&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergencies/Disturbances</p>
<p>3.1.1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 800&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrest/Detention/Courts</p>
<p>3.1.1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 900&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report Writing</p>
<p>3.1.1.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weapons/Ammunition/Equipment</p>
<p>3.1.1.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uniforms/Grooming</p>
<p>3.1.1.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance/Vehicles/Property</p>
<p>3.1.1.13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Orders</p>
<p>3.1.1.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executive Orders</p>
<p>3.1.1.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Training Education/Bulletins</p>
<p>3.1.1.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Division/Precinct Miscellaneous Files&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp; Mandatory Sub-Sections:</strong></p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conjunction with the directives&rsquo; section numbers, there are sub-sections relative to most of the RUs. In order to ensure continuity, these sub-sections have been assigned specific numbers and will be used by those involved with the filing system. Any of the sub-sections may be further sub-divided. Refer to the section on Filing Procedures for an example.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp; Filing Manual:</strong></p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200.1 Budget</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600.1 Intelligence</p>
<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600.2 Parks</p>
<p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 600.3 Special Events</p>
<p>5.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 700.1 Tactical Areas of Responsibility&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp; RU Filing Manual &ndash; Section:</strong></p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each RU using this filing system will maintain an alphabetical cross index and section number index. These cross-indexes and a copy of this directive will make up the RU&rsquo;s Filing Manual Section 001.00.</p>
<p>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When assigning file numbers, any material to be filed that directly relates to a policy or procedure in the directives will be assigned the same directive section number. For example, the Section 630.30 of the directives that deals with Ride-Alongs under the Bureau filing system could be further broken down by the RU&rsquo;s by adding 630.30.1 Ride-Alongs &ndash; Accepted and 630.30.2 Ride-Alongs &ndash; Refused.</p>
<p>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Material relating to a section number, but not corresponding to a specific directive, will be numbered with a section number and a decimal designation. For example, RUs wishing to file information on the armory will find there is no specific decimal breakdown for Armories. However, the subject matter relates to Section 1000 Weapons/Ammunition/Personal Equipment and armory information could be filed immediately behind the 1000 divider and would be assigned number, 1000.0 Armory. For another example, Central Precinct could assign numbers to specific parks under the 600.0 Parks sub-section by giving them number 600.2.1 for Washington Park and 600.2.2 for Council Crest Park.</p>
<p>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 3000 is designated for each RU use to file material not logically related to Bureau section numbers. The decimal numbering system should be used within the 3000 series when organizing the file. For example, 3000.1 Annexations, 3000.1.1 Johns Subdivision and 3000.1.2 Smith Subdivision.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7.&nbsp; Incorrect Numbering:</strong></p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except when numbering files in conjunction with a directive section number, RUs will assign numbers only as described above. For example, 630.30 Community Policing Citizen Ride-Along Program. Assigning the number 630.31 to a file relating to Ride-Alongs would be incorrect. 630.30.1 Ride-Alongs-Accepted would be the correct file number assignment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Policy</strong>:</p>
<p>1. The purpose of this directive is to establish the process for the review and development of Portland Police Bureau directives.</p>
<p>2. The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that community members entrust the Bureau with great authority. &nbsp;As a result, the Bureau has a responsibility to the public to ensure that its members appropriately exercise that authority. &nbsp;Member accountability is paramount.&nbsp; The Bureau must demonstrate responsibility for guiding member action and holding members accountable to established policies and procedures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The Bureau strives to establish policies and procedures that promote professional practices and guide members to be good stewards of public resources. &nbsp;Bureau directives serve as the foundation for all Portland Police Bureau operations. &nbsp;The policies and procedures contained in directives promote professional practices and provide staff with information to act decisively, consistently and legally. &nbsp;When unusual circumstances are encountered, the directives assist members in identifying the best course of action to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The Bureau values the input of community members and our working partners.&nbsp; Collaboration and community involvement are essential to ensuring that Bureau policies and procedures reflect the values of the community we serve.&nbsp; For this reason, the Bureau encourages community members and other key stakeholders to participate in the directive development process by contributing feedback on directives when they are scheduled for review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">Procedure</strong><span style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">:</span></p>
<p>1. Process Initiation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. Any member of the Bureau may contact the Policy Development Team to request the creation of a new directive or the revision or rescission of an existing directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2. Existing directives shall be reviewed every two years from the time of enactment by the Chief or designee.&nbsp; The review history shall be documented at the bottom of each directive.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1. The Chief or designee shall have the authority to adjust the review schedule of a directive if an operational need requires that the directive be immediately reviewed and modified or when otherwise deemed necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3. New directives shall undergo a one-year review from the time of enactment.&nbsp; Upon completion of the year one review, the Bureau shall adjust the review period to align with the standard two-year review schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4. Prior to being approved by the Department of Justice (DOJ), directives that pertain to compliance with the 2012 DOJ Settlement Agreement shall undergo the standard universal review and public comment processes, as established in this policy.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1. After receiving DOJ approval and pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, all DOJ-identified directives are subject to an initial semi-annual review, followed by annual reviews thereafter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5. Occasionally, the initiation of the directives review and/or development process may be tied to an administrative, legislative, or legal rationale.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.1. Administrative matters that may create a need to address a directive include, but are not limited to:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Council Report: A formal communication from City Bureaus/Offices to Council, which provides information, transmits other documents, and/or makes recommendations. Reports are commonly used to approve bids and the completion of contracts, make appointments to boards or commissions, make recommendations, and more.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ordinance: A formal document, which carries the binding force of law and is passed by the Council in accordance with rules set forth in the City Charter. Two kinds of ordinances, emergency and non-emergency, appear on the Agenda. Emergency ordinances, designated in the Agenda by an asterisk preceding the agenda number, require a unanimous vote with at least four (4) Council members present to vote. Non-emergency ordinances come before Council twice and go into effect thirty (30) days after passage by Council. Public testimony is generally taken only at the first reading and the vote is taken at the second reading. Only three (3) votes are needed for approval.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Resolution: A formal document, which establishes Council policy or directs certain administrative actions. It requires only one reading and approval by three (3) Council members.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because all requests and transactions requiring City Council approval will be developed and submitted through an ordinance or resolution, the Chief&rsquo;s Office must approve Police Bureau-specific council reports and any associated documentation before materials are submitted for Council consideration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Fiscal Services Division staffs the Chief&rsquo;s Office on council reports and associated documentation, in accordance with Administrative Rule 7.01, Drafting Manual for Ordinances, Resolutions, and Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Responsibility Unit Managers must consult with Fiscal Services Division about when an ordinance or resolution is required. Generally, anything that represents a financial risk or potential liability to the City should go before Council. Examples range to include, but are not limited to: grants, memorandum of understanding or agreement amendments, contracts or contractual amendments, intergovernmental agreements or agreement amendments, procurement requests, updates to city code, and gift transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Responsibility Unit Managers must follow the Fiscal Services Division&rsquo;s direction with regard to preparation necessities including coordination with other City Bureaus/Offices (e.g. City Attorney&rsquo;s Office, Office of Finance and Management, Auditor&rsquo;s Office), formatting, submission deadlines, Council Meeting attendance, and presentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It generally takes four (4) weeks to develop a council report and any associated documentation, obtain the Chief&rsquo;s Office approval, and submit materials for official action, therefore advanced planning and cooperation is of utmost importance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (240.10)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau will provide support and emotional care to immediate survivors of a member who is killed in the line-of-duty or who dies a natural or accidental death. The wishes of the family regarding funeral arrangements take priority over the desires of the Bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (240.10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Beneficiary: The person designated by the member as recipients of specific death benefits.</p>
<p>Death benefits: The financial payments made to the family to ensure financial stability following the loss of a loved one.</p>
<p>Family Liaison Officer: Preferably a member(s) who is close to the family and able to provide needed support without causing him/herself undue emotional stress. Honor Guard and Highland Guard: Special units that provide assistance with funeral functions such as ushers, guards for the body, rifle salutes, bagpipers and liaisons with other agencies&rsquo; Honor Guards and representatives.</p>
<p>Incident Supervisor: The Personnel Division manager (Personnel) or designee, who will oversee all line-of duty death/natural death incidents and act as liaison with Chief of Police&rsquo;s Office, the affected member&rsquo;s RU manager and the Police Liaison Officer.</p>
<p>Line-of-duty death: Any action, felonious or accidental, which claims the life of a member who is performing work-related functions while on or off duty.</p>
<p>Notification team: At least two designees, appointed by the member&rsquo;s RU manager, who will follow the notification procedure.</p>
<p>Police Liaison Officer (PLO): The Bureau&rsquo;s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Coordinator who will coordinate the events following the line-of-duty death, including acting as liaison between the Bureau and the family and coordinating all benefits to which the survivors are entitled. The Personnel Lieutenant and Sergeant, along with the Disability Benefits Coordinator will provide assistance and support to the PLO. The EAP office will coordinate the appropriate response from all EAP volunteer groups, including the Traumatic Incident Committee, Peer Support Team, Chaplains, Police Alcohol and Recovery Team.</p>
<p>Survivors: The immediate family members of the deceased member, including the spouse, domestic partner, children, parent, siblings, fianc&eacute; and/or significant others.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notification (240.10)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the affected member&rsquo;s RU manager to notify the next of kin of a member who has suffered severe injuries or who has died. The RU manager may personally make the notification or designate at least two members to make the notification.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The member&rsquo;s RU manager should immediately notify the EAP Coordinator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The Chief of Police will be notified immediately by the member&rsquo;s RU manager.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Notification should always be made in person and with more than one member present, as long as the survivors are in the area. A team could include a chaplain or other appropriate designee. Notification may also include the need to transport the next of kin to the treating medical facility. Upon receiving word of severe injury or death of a member, do not wait. Immediately after notification, transport the next of kin to the treating medical facility.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;If an immediate survivor or a family member of the affected Bureau member has a known medical problem such as a heart condition, high blood pressure, etc., medical personnel should be available at the time of death notification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Take special care to avoid making a death notification on the doorstep. Once inside the home, find out who is present in the home in order to gather everyone together, to prevent some family members, especially children, from overhearing the news from another room inside the home.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;If specifics of the incident are known, relay as much of the information as you have. Be sure to use the member&rsquo;s name during the notification. If the member has died, state that the member has died or is dead. Do not give a false hope by using softer words such as gone away or passed away.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;If the family insists on driving themselves to the treating medical facility, a Bureau member should accompany them.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;If young children are in the home and childcare is required, the Notification Team shall assist in arranging for childcare. This may involve calling a co-worker, spouse(s), Peer Support, transportation for the children to the home of a friend or relative or similar arrangement.</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (210.70)</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the Portland Police Bureau to establish clear comprehensive guidelines for secondary employment contracts between the City of Portland and local businesses. These contracts are managed through mutual agreement by the Portland Police Officer&rsquo;s Association (PPA).</p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau may approve, at the discretion of the Operations Branch chief (or designee), those contracts which provide for an enhanced public safety presence at certain events or ongoing operations. The contracted work must be a policing function that provides a benefit to the public, and is not focused solely on the interests of the business. In fulfilling the secondary employment contracts, members assigned to the contract shall perform their duties within the operational directives and mission of the Bureau.</p>
<p>In approving secondary employment contracts, the Operations Branch chief (or designee) shall consider the following:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; The event has a discernable impact on the safety of the community.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; The event provides a benefit to the greater community.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; If the establishment or the persons controlling the establishment initiated proceedings against the City of Portland may cause adverse actions for the City of Portland.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; If there a significant criminal history associated to the person(s) controlling the establishment.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; If this is primarily a security function for the sole benefit of the establishment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (210.70)</strong></p>
<p>All secondary employment requests shall be directed to the RU manager overseeing the geographical area where the event will take place, or in the case involving a special skill needed, such as Traffic Division, it shall be directed to the appropriate RU manager. The procedure for approval shall be as follows:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; After signing of the contractual agreement between the Portland Police Bureau and the employer, the contract will be sent forward to PPA for the filling of positions as agreed upon in the contract.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; In the event where the PPA is unable to fill the positions as defined in the contract, the RU manager has the right to terminate the contract prior to its execution.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Fiscal Services will be responsible for the billing process associated with all secondary employment contracts.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; RU managers will strive to enter into secondary employment contracts consistently and fairly.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL (210.70)</strong></p>
<p>All contracts will be sent electronically to the Operations Branch administrative assistant where the files will be saved. There will be an annual review of the contracts by the Operations Branch chief or their designee.</p>

Members will promptly review their paychecks for the accuracy of regular hours and overtime paid, compensatory time credited and vacation, compensatory time or other leaves taken. Members will report to their timekeeper or immediate supervisor any inconsistency that may not accurately reflect their time records by their next shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Approve the accuracy of the Uniform Daily Assignment Roster (UDAR), overtime entries, absences, and regular schedules with digital signature (user login/password) daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; When members are assigned to training, travel or other temporary assignments, supervisors will ensure training, travel and supporting documents are consistent with the member&rsquo;s start and end times reported for regular and overtime hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coordinate vacation, training, and other related staffing requirements to minimize staffing shortages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure members perform in a manner that minimizes the need for overtime. For example, assign non-emergency service requests received near shift changes to on-coming shift members or the completion of police reports include only the minimum number of members integral to a case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure all overtime is authorized in advance, unless unforeseen circumstances exist. Ensure that overtime is accurately entered into the UDAR overtime module in accordance with the Fiscal Services Division&rsquo;s procedures and deadlines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Responsibility Unit Manager Responsibilities:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure the Responsibility Unit evaluates all aspects of assignments to determine if overtime is justified or if performance may be managed in a way that minimizes the need for overtime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitor overtime reports and identify any unusual, unexplained, or disproportionate overtime expenditures. For example, an unexplained change in overtime when compared to similar time period or activity, or a significant increase in overtime expenditures at a rate that could negatively affect the Police Bureau&rsquo;s budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Responsibility Unit will have an established Standard Operating Procedure in place to ensure timekeeping documents are accurate and reported expeditiously to the Fiscal Services Division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Fiscal Services Division Responsibilities:</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accurately account for reported time while consistently applying timekeeping rules.</p>
<p>5.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau of Human Resources and the Police Bureau&rsquo;s Personnel Division will interpret all bargaining agreements when necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prepare and analyze timekeeping documents for processing by Central Payroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. Consistent with principles of public accountability, the Bureau expects all non-sworn non-represented and Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempt, and PPCOA represented Police Bureau members to account for their work time and activities by tracking time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In an effort to fulfill its goal of conserving and streamlining business processes, all portions of the time tracking process should be kept digitally and not printed, where feasible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The intent of management leave is to recognize exceptional additional individual efforts, performance, and achievements, including but not limited to beyond the standard workweek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

</ol>

<ul>
<li>Legal documents:&nbsp; For purposes of this policy, legal documents refer to all documents notifying a member that the member, the Bureau, or the City are defendants or potential defendants in a civil lawsuit or tort claim.&nbsp; Legal documents will not include subpoenas or public records requests, which are handled under a separate directive.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""pa5CxSpMiddle"">&nbsp;<strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. This directive establishes the procedure for Bureau members who become involved in a lawsuit against the member where they were acting within the course of their employment or duties.</p>
<p>2. Generally, a person may file a lawsuit against the City of Portland (&ldquo;City&rdquo;) and/or an individual member of the Bureau alleging claims related to actions a member took within the scope of a member&rsquo;s employment or duties.&nbsp; Legal documents related to lawsuits can be served by a hired process server, a member of a Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, or any other competent adult aside from the person suing (Plaintiff).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Rules for service of legal documents are different depending on the identity of the party being sued (Defendant).&nbsp; This directive guides Bureau member interactions with a process server or other person attempting service and sets forth the responsibilities of those members who are named as Defendants or potential Defendants.</p>
<p>4. For purposes of this policy and due to the fact that members do not have an &ldquo;office&rdquo; for purposes of office service, members must be personally served when they are individually named in litigation relating to actions within the scope of the members&rsquo; employment or duties.&nbsp; The Court Coordinator is not authorized to accept personal service of lawsuits for individually named members.</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (316.30)</strong></p>
<p>It is a critical component of service delivery of the Portland Police Bureau to maintain a drug-free workplace. Members who engage in the unauthorized use of drugs and alcohol risk their safety, the safety of their co-workers, and the safety, well-being, and trust of the citizens they serve. It is therefore imperative that members are held to a standard that assures the citizens and the other employees they are not under the influence of these substances while at the workplace. This policy will be for all Police Bureau members, both sworn and non-sworn.</p>
<p>Members will be tested for alcohol or drugs whenever there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has engaged in prohibited alcohol use or prohibited drug use. Reasonable suspicion will be based on specific, concurrent, articulable observations made by a trained supervisor, concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (316.30)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>

<p>Drug test: A test conducted whereby an authorized lab technician or designee obtains a sample of urine from a test subject for analysis of its content for drugs or alcohol.</p>
<p>Impairment: Diminished ability, loss or limitation of physical, mental or sensory function. A condition associated with any drug, including but not limited to alcohol.</p>
<p>Reasonable suspicion: Objective and articulable facts that would make a reasonable supervisor believe that a person was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or that a person&rsquo;s ability to perform the functions of their job was impaired, or their ability to do their job safely was compromised.</p>
<p>Safety sensitive function: Includes, but is not limited to, situations in which a member must exercise judgment about whether and when to use force, operate a motor vehicle, and/or have any contact with members of the community.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Under ORS &sect;133.235, Peace Officer Arrests, sworn officers retain their authority twenty-four (24) hours a day, anywhere in Oregon. While Police Bureau members may be authorized to take police action when off duty, off duty members should defer to the appropriate law enforcement agency whenever possible. Members taking off duty police action lack equipment, risk injury, and may create confusion on scene. The ability for a member to be a good witness and/or summon on duty help is highly valuable and furthers quality police work.</p>
<p>2. A member who takes off duty police action in effect becomes an on duty member for Police Bureau purposes.</p>
<p class=""Pa5""><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
<p class=""Pa5"">1. A member considering off duty police action (e.g. stopping or detaining a subject, making an arrest, showing police identification in an official capacity, etc.), must assess the incident and assess their abilities in relation to the incident, by taking into account the following factors, before initiating off duty police action:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal Assessment:</p>
<p>1.1.1. Fitness for duty (e.g. physical injury or impairment (intoxication)),</p>
<p>1.1.2. Ability to communicate with public safety responders,<strong></strong></p>
<p>1.1.3. Threat of injury,</p>
<p>1.1.4. Availability of police equipment. <strong></strong></p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Incident Assessment:</p>
<p>1.2.1.&nbsp; Seriousness of the offense, <strong></strong></p>
<p>1.2.2. Availability of on duty assistance,</p>
<p>1.2.3. Threat of injury,</p>
<p>1.2.4. Immediacy of the need to prevent the crime or apprehend the suspect,<strong></strong></p>
<p>1.2.5. Tactical situation.<strong></strong></p>
<p>2. Members shall not make arrests, issue citations, write reports, or otherwise use their official position to gain an advantage in a personal conflict, whether on or off duty. When a personal relationship is involved, members may not take police action except to prevent an immediate threat of physical confrontation. In said situations, members shall notify the agency responsible for the jurisdiction in which the event is occurring for appropriate action and investigation. Members shall immediately notify an on duty Portland Police Bureau supervisor about this call for service either in person or by phone.</p>
<p>3. A member who takes off duty police action shall immediately:</p>
<p class=""Pa5"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify an on duty supervisor in the jurisdiction where the action occurred, either in person or by phone,</p>
<p class=""Pa5"">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify an on duty supervisor with the Bureau, either in person or by phone,</p>
<p class=""Pa5"">3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify their supervisor, either in person or by phone,</p>
<p class=""Pa5"">3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Document their activities within an appropriate police report during their next work shift or as required by a supervisor.</p>

<li>Information Technology: Mobile communication devices, computers, telecommunications hardware, software and systems that utilize the Internet and/or any other communication network.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>As an entity of the City of Portland, Portland Police Bureau comports with the administrative rules set forth by the Bureau of Human Resources.&nbsp; The appropriate use of all Bureau resources is the responsibility of each member and relates directly to official activity which the member was hired to perform.&nbsp; Resources shall be used for their intended purpose in accordance with the law (e.g., state, local, contracts, licenses, property rights, records, etc.) and approved policy, procedure, or training.</li>
<li>The Bureau entrusts its members with the use of all Bureau resources such as City facilities, office fixtures, office supplies or equipment, electronic and physical records, police uniforms and equipment, information technology, and vehicles. Less obvious examples of Bureau resources include work time, data, and information. &nbsp;Inappropriate uses of resources include, but are not limited to, facilitating unauthorized access or modification, negligent or purposeful misuse, abuse, breach, damage, destruction, loss, or theft.</li>
<li>All information technologies created or stored on City-owned information systems are considered City property, and as such, all employees shall have no expectation of personal privacy in the use of the City&rsquo;s information technologies.&nbsp; The uses of passwords are meant to protect the security of City data and information technologies and are not intended to convey an expectation of personal privacy or exclusion from monitoring.</li>
<li>The Bureau, under the City of Portland&rsquo;s rights as a public employer, reserves the right to search, without member consent, all areas and property over which the City maintains joint or full control. &nbsp;All Bureau vehicles, equipment, offices, desks, files, and lockers are subject to search by management. &nbsp;Searches shall be conducted in the presence of the member, if practicable. &nbsp;If the member is not available, or if the member so requests, a reasonable time will be allowed for a representative to be present before a search is conducted. &nbsp;The limitation on the City&rsquo;s right to examine City property contained in this paragraph does not apply to property used jointly by more than one member.</li>
<li>The use of Bureau resources could invoke a collective bargaining provision(s) or right(s). In the event there is a conflict between a City right and a collective bargaining provision or right, the collective bargaining provision or right prevails. &nbsp;</li>
<li>While members are issued information technologies because they have a need to remain in contact with the public, other members, and the chain of command to conduct official police business, the use of Bureau resources generates public records, and is subject to public records law (e.g., retention, confidentiality, disclosure).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Member Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. Information Technology.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.2. Limited personal use of information technology is permitted so long as members comply with the guidelines listed in the City&rsquo;s HRAR 4.08, Information Technologies (e.g., use is limited to short duration, does not result in public expense, does not interfere with job activities, does not violate &ldquo;prohibited uses&rdquo;).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.3. Members issued Bureau smart phones (cell) shall refer to Directive 1221.00, Smart Phone Issuance and Usage, for additional guidelines.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.8. Considerations While Using Information Technology.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.8.1. Members should be aware that the use of City resources constitutes an express consent to monitoring at all times.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.2. Members should consider parking constraints at precincts and other police facilities. &nbsp;If a Bureau vehicle has an assigned parking space, members are required to utilize that space.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.2.1. Members who are assigned a Bureau vehicle with a reserved parking space shall park in the designated location unless temporary circumstances prevent them from doing so.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. As public employees, Police Bureau members are required to comply with ethics laws and be mindful of even the appearance of impropriety. Because ethics law is detailed and nuanced, conduct that could appear dishonest to a reasonable observer will undermine the public trust even if the conduct is not prohibited. Members demonstrate mindfulness by being aware of ethics law, including state law, Human Resources Administrative Rules, and Bureau Directives. Members ensure compliance by consulting about ethical matters with the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office, through their chain of command, to ensure proper interpretation of relevant law as applied to their particular circumstance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Members are not permitted to use their official position to seek or receive a personal financial gain or avoid financial loss, nor to obtain a privilege or avoid a consequence, that would not otherwise be available but for their position as a public employee, sworn and non-sworn alike. Restrictions on receipt of benefits or avoidance of financial loss extend to people within the member&rsquo;s household or any legal entity in which the member of a person in the member&rsquo;s household is financially interested (e.g. business, not-for-profit organization, etc.). The following examples are non-exhaustive - because ethics law is detailed and nuanced, members ensure compliance with ethics law by consulting about ethical matters with the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office, through their chain of command, to ensure proper interpretation of relevant law as applied to their particular circumstance.</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of personal financial gain include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Authorizing purchases with public funds or recommending or awarding business to an entity with which a member or a member of their household is financially interested.</p>
<p>2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to follow established City procedures for services (e.g. towing, procurement, contracts, etc.).</p>
<p>2.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using travel incentives earned because of travel on behalf of the City for personal travel (e.g. frequent flyer miles, compensation for being &lsquo;bumped&rsquo; off overbooked flight, etc.)</p>
<p>2.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other examples relate to Directive 312.50, Identification (e.g. using Police Bureau identification to obtain a personal, financial benefit).</p>
<p>2.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other examples relate to Directive 313.20, Political Activity (e.g. influencing political activity for personal, financial benefit).</p>
<p>2.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other examples relate to Directive 631.35, Press/Media Relations (e.g. endorsing one media outlet over another).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of avoiding personal financial loss include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directive 313.10, Gratuities, Gifts, and Rewards (e.g. accepting a discount to avoid paying full cost for an item or service).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of privileges include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directive 210.85, Academic Achievement (e.g. use of information received because of City employment, which is confidential or not readily available to the public for academic purposes).</p>
<p>2.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directive 317.40, Authorized Use of Bureau Resources (e.g. use of information received because of City employment, which is confidential or not readily available to the public for personal benefit).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examples of consequences include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>2.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempting to avoid a fine, citation, or arrest (e.g. parking or moving violation, DUII).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Members are expected to report conduct they believe to be unethical to their chain of command, the Bureau of Human Resources, and/or the City Attorney's Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Command Staff Responsibilities:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate awareness of ethics law among direct reports.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Respond to a member&rsquo;s report of unethical behavior by working with the member to consult with the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office and/or the Bureau of Human Resources.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult with the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office and the Bureau of Human Resources about ethics law with regard to Bureau purposes (e.g. organizing special events, recommending retailers or authorizing discounts on equipment purchases, coordinating compassion dinners for injured members, etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<li>Social Media: Websites and other forms of Internet communication used to provide or share information, ideas, messages, photographs, videos and other content. &nbsp;Examples of social media sites include, but are not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr and LinkedIn.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. The Police Bureau recognizes the increasing use of social media both personally and in the workplace.&nbsp; This Directive addresses the personal use of social media by Bureau members, whether that use occurs on personal time or during work hours. &nbsp;It does not address the official use of social media by members for police business while on or off duty. &nbsp;Official use of social media for community outreach, crime prevention, problem solving, and general information exchanges will be governed by a separate directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Members have a right to engage in personal expression as private citizens. &nbsp;However, the Bureau may regulate such private expression when the members&rsquo; private expression on social media unduly disrupts Bureau operations or violates other Bureau directives such as the prohibition against disclosing sensitive, confidential, or protected information. &nbsp;Personal use of social media may affect a member&rsquo;s official position with the Police Bureau and may impact the effective operations of the Bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Social media communications that constitute protected union-related activities are not restricted by this directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. When using personal social media, members may express themselves as private citizens, but shall not:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. Post or use any image of Police Bureau badges, identification, name tags or plates, logos, patches, marked vehicles, marked equipment or other marked materials without the express prior permission of the Chief of Police or a designee.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1. Members may post or use photographs of themselves taken in uniform while:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.1.1. Appearing for official ceremonies or recognitions, promotions, awards or commendations; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.1.2. Taking part in Bureau sponsored or approved events.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.2. This policy does not prohibit members from reposting information, photographs, videos or other materials that have been previously published or are otherwise available in the public domain (i.e., available to the public as a whole).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.3. A social media platform&rsquo;s automatic assignment of such an image to a member will not alone violate this policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2. Post, publish, transmit, share or disseminate any documents, photographs, videos or information that they have access to solely as a result of their employment with the Bureau.&nbsp; This prohibition includes information that is confidential or investigative in nature (e.g., crime or accident scene images, Bureau training materials, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3. Post, publish, transmit, share or disseminate any comments or information that negatively impact or unduly disrupt the operations of the Bureau or that unduly criticizes&nbsp;the official decisions or actions of the Bureau, and causes actual harm to Bureau operations as a result.&nbsp; The balancing test for protected free speech requires an analysis of whether actual harm to Bureau operations occurs as the result of a member&rsquo;s use of speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4. Post, publish, transmit, share or otherwise disseminate information that is confidential or is otherwise restricted from disclosure by law or Bureau policy that pertains to Bureau-related tactics or mission-specific strategies and objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes any information obtained by the member solely because of the member's position with the Bureau.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5. Post, publish, transmit, share or disseminate any comments or information that promotes or advocates a violation of City or Bureau directives or other policies or criminal activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6. Post, publish, transmit, share or disseminate any documents, comments or information that are confidential or otherwise restricted from disclosure by law or Bureau policy regarding community member complaints about the Bureau or any of its members, administrative investigations, criminal investigations, criminal prosecutions, or legal claims or court cases involving&nbsp;the Bureau or any&nbsp;Bureau members.&nbsp; This includes any information obtained by the member solely because of the member's position with the Bureau.&nbsp; Members may post, publish, transmit, share or disseminate such information&nbsp;already&nbsp;available in the public domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.7. Post, publish, transmit, share, comment in support of, or disseminate any posting that is harassing or includes any threat of actual violence. &nbsp;Members should be aware that the Bureau may prohibit inflammatory posts that are directed to inciting or producing immediate lawless action and are likely to incite or produce such action.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.8. Post, publish, transmit, share, comment in support of, or disseminate any posting that ridicules, disparages or negatively expresses bias or disrespect towards any race, religion, sex, gender, marital or familial status, sexual orientation, nationality, age, disability or any other legally protected classification as defined in City of Portland Human Resources Administrative Regulation (HRAR) 2.02 or PPB directives or policies.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.8.1. Members should be aware that such comments made outside of the workplace or outside of a work-related setting, as described in HRAR 2.02, may still be prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.9. Post, publish, transmit or disseminate any statements, photographs, endorsements, information or materials that represent or purports to represent the official views or position of the Police Bureau or the City of Portland, without the express prior approval of the Chief of Police or a designee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Members are permitted to access social media accounts on Bureau-issued computers and Mobile Data Computers (MDCs) while on duty for the purpose of executing a specific work function.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1. When using social media in an official capacity on an authorized Bureau-issued computer or MDC, members shall not accept any social media platform&rsquo;s invitation to determine or track the location of the device or the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2. Members are prohibited from using Bureau-issued cell phones to access personal social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3. Members shall not use any Police Bureau or City of Portland email address to register for any personal social media account.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Policy</strong>:</p>
<p>1. The EIS is an application that compiles information from the Police Bureau and other data sources to enable a comprehensive review of a sworn member&rsquo;s work performance. &nbsp;The use of EIS benefits the Bureau and sworn members alike by facilitating professional growth through a feedback process that reinforces the Bureau&rsquo;s management and accountability systems, standards, and expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. It is the policy of the Bureau to encourage and develop personnel. &nbsp;EIS supports this goal by supplying information to supervisors that will allow them to better develop, manage, and support their sworn members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. EIS and the information developed therein shall not form the basis for disciplinary action but may be used for non-disciplinary notice purposes, such as development of work performance plans and letters of expectation. &nbsp;The reports from EIS may not be used by the City for disciplinary, transfer or promotion decisions. &nbsp;However, if the underlying data that appears in EIS is maintained separately by the City and is simply reflected in EIS, nothing in this directive prevents the City from making appropriate use of the underlying data in disciplinary, transfer, or promotion decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. The AMS and PDT shall be treated as confidential material.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
<p>1. Performance Discussion Tracker:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;The PDT allows supervisors to record discussions about a member&rsquo;s performance and behavior. &nbsp;Every entry to a member&rsquo;s PDT should be preceded by a discussion with the member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;Supervisors who observe positive behavior or performance related to a member&rsquo;s job duties as described in the member&rsquo;s personnel evaluation form (ref: Directive 215.00, Member Performance Evaluations) are encouraged to discuss the observation with the member and make an entry to the member&rsquo;s PDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;Supervisors who counsel a member or engage in other non-disciplinary corrective action, whether during normal operations; during an after action review in accordance with Directives 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reporting and 1010.00, Use of Force; or as part of another formal process such as a Supervisory Investigation, shall make an entry about the event and the corrective action undertaken in the member&rsquo;s PDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;At minimum, any entry made under Section 1.2 or 1.3 shall contain a brief synopsis of the incident, any relevant reference number (case number, CAD number, etc.), and an indication of how additional information may be obtained (e.g., contact the supervisor, review an after action, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;Upon notification that a sworn member&rsquo;s use of force has resulted in a finding of liability in a civil trial, the EIS Administrator shall make an entry reflecting the event in the member&rsquo;s PDT. &nbsp;In addition, the EIS Administrator shall generate an alert and send it to the sworn member&rsquo;s RU Manager for review.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6.&nbsp;EIS automatically generates an e-mail to a member when a supervisor makes an entry in their PDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.7.&nbsp;Members may submit a response to PDT entries by writing a memorandum through their chain of command, to their RU Manager, and sending an electronic copy of the memorandum to the EIS Administrator.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.7.1.&nbsp;Upon receipt, the RU Manager will forward a copy of the memorandum to the EIS Administrator, retaining the original in their file.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.7.2.&nbsp;The EIS Administrator will enter the response in the sworn member&rsquo;s PDT upon receipt of the copy of the memorandum described in Section 1.7.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Review of Sworn Member Data Upon Transfer:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;Supervisors who have sworn members new to their command, whether due to the transfer of the supervisor or transfer of the sworn members, shall review the sworn members&rsquo; EIS record and document this review occurred in the sworn members&rsquo; PDT within thirty (30) days of the transfer.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;This requirement applies to all temporary assignments (TDY, acting supervisor, etc.) that are in effect for more than thirty (30) continuous days, as well as a return to normal status from a temporary assignment (including all types of leave described in Directive 210.21, Leaves from Service) in effect for more than thirty (30) continuous days.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;Prior to completing a sworn member&rsquo;s performance evaluation conducted in accordance with Directive 215.00, Member Performance Evaluations, or Human Resources Administrative Rule 9.02, Performance Management, supervisors will review the information available in EIS, including the various external data sources, PDT, and AMS.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.1.&nbsp;EIS contains aggregate and comparison data that may be useful in completing the evaluation and facilitating a career development conversation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.2.&nbsp;After concluding the review, the supervisor shall document that the review occurred in the sworn member&rsquo;s PDT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Performance Discussion Tracker and After Actions:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;Supervisors who address a sworn member&rsquo;s performance in the Recommendation and Critique Section of an After Action Report written in accordance with Directives 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reporting and 1010.00, Use of Force, shall place an entry in the sworn member&rsquo;s PDT. This requirement applies to the following events/incidents:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">(a)&nbsp;Vehicle pursuits;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">(i)&nbsp; Destruction of animal(s).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1.&nbsp;This entry shall be made prior to forwarding the After Action Report to the next level of review unless the supervisor is unable to either personally make the entry or cause the entry to be made within the timelines established in Directives 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reporting and 1010.00, Use of Force. &nbsp;If the entry is not made prior to forwarding the After Action Report to the next level of review, the supervisor shall do the following prior to forwarding the After Action Report:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.1.&nbsp;Note the inability to make the entry in the After Action Report;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.2.&nbsp;E-mail either the EIS Administrator or a supervisor in the member&rsquo;s RU and request the entry be made; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.3.&nbsp;Request in the After Action Report that the next level of review verify that the entry has been made in the sworn member&rsquo;s PDT.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.2.&nbsp;Supervisors who receive an After Action Report where an EIS entry has been requested but not made under the procedure described in Section 3.1.1 shall document that the entry has been made in their After Action Report comments.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.3.&nbsp;The entry shall include, at a minimum:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.3.1.&nbsp;The case number of the incident,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.3.2.&nbsp;The nature of the incident and, if applicable, the type of force used,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.3.3.&nbsp;Whether the incident was within policy,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.3.4.&nbsp;Any positive performance, and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.3.5.&nbsp;Any training deficiencies, policy deficiencies, or poor tactical decisions identified as well as any non-disciplinary corrective action taken to remedy them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;Pursuant to Directives 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reporting and 1010.00, Use of Force, all After Action Reports must be reviewed by the sworn member&rsquo;s chain of command. &nbsp;A manager (lieutenant or above) who is reviewing an After Action Report prepared by a subordinate shall make an EIS entry under the following circumstances:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.1.&nbsp;When the manager identifies a previously unidentified training deficiency, policy deficiency, or poor tactical decision made by the sworn member, the manager shall make an entry in the sworn member&rsquo;s PDT in accordance with this directive, in addition to ensuring the appropriate corrective action is provided to the sworn member.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.2.&nbsp;When the manager concludes the critique, analysis, or other commentary provided by any subordinate level of review is inadequate, inaccurate, or incomplete, the manager shall, if the matter is not referred to Internal Affairs &nbsp;(IA), provide the appropriate non-disciplinary corrective action and document it in the subordinate&rsquo;s PDT with:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.2.1.&nbsp;The case number of the incident,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.2.2.&nbsp;The nature of the incident,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.2.3.&nbsp;The nature of the deficiency, and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.2.4.&nbsp;The non-disciplinary corrective action taken.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.3.&nbsp;Entries made in accordance with Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 may require the manager to make entries in multiple subordinates&rsquo; PDTs.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.4.&nbsp;The manager shall make any PDT entry required by Section 3.2.1., and 3.2.2., prior to forwarding the investigation to the next level of review.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;When a subordinate&rsquo;s performance on an After Action investigation or review exceeds the expectations of the organization, managers and supervisors shall make an entry to the subordinate&rsquo;s PDT documenting the performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Type I and Type II Alerts and Review Process.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;EIS Administrator Alert and Review Process Responsibilities:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.1.1.&nbsp;If a member has reached a threshold, the EIS Administrator shall generate an alert in the AMS.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.1.&nbsp;Every alert is evaluated by the EIS Administrator in accordance with the Professional Standards Division&rsquo;s (PSD) Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) 44 for individual sworn members and SOP 47 for groups and their respective supervisors.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.2.&nbsp;If the EIS Administrator determines that the member&rsquo;s supervisor should review the alert, the EIS Administrator shall send the alert to the member&rsquo;s RU Manager with a request for the RU Manager to review the alert.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.3.&nbsp;If the EIS Administrator does not request an RU Manager Review, the alert is sent to the PSD Lieutenant for review as outlined in Section 4.4.3.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.4.&nbsp;Any decision made during this process, and the reason(s) for it, shall be documented in the &ldquo;case notes&rdquo; section of the alert.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bias-Based Policing: &nbsp;The differential treatment of any person or any group of persons and/or any discriminatory practices by the Bureau or its members that are motivated by prejudicial judgments of the individual on the basis of their membership in classes protected by law or Bureau policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Equity: &nbsp;The process of creating policies and procedures to promote the fair and unbiased treatment of all individuals and to remove differences in treatment of Bureau members and community members based on membership in classes protected by law or Bureau policy.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee:&nbsp; A statewide, governor-appointed committee that is charged with the duties of assisting Oregon law enforcement agencies with stop data collection and analysis efforts, improving community relations, training efforts, and policy recommendations that pertain to ensuring equity in Oregon law enforcement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Probable Cause: &nbsp;&nbsp;A substantial objective basis for believing that, more likely than not, an offense has been committed and a person to be arrested has committed it.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Profiling: Where a Bureau member targets an individual belonging to a class protected by law or Bureau policy when conducting stops or detentions unless the Bureau member is acting on suspect description or information related to an identified or suspected violation of a provision of law.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Reasonable Suspicion: &nbsp;An objective test measured at the time and place the member acts and based on the totality of the circumstances, which requires a member to point to specific, articulable facts giving rise to a reasonable inference that a subject has engaged or is engaging in criminal activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop:&nbsp; Temporary restraint of a person&rsquo;s liberty by a sworn member who is lawfully present in any place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong>Policy:</strong></strong></p>
<p>1. The Bureau is dedicated to offering courteous and professional service delivery and providing equal protection, a fundamental right under the Constitution, to all members of the community.&nbsp; The Bureau endeavors to create an organizational culture that promotes nondiscriminatory and inclusionary practices, and its members shall strive to enforce laws and policies in an impartial and equitable manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Bureau members are committed to respecting and preserving the constitutional rights of all individuals. &nbsp;Members are prohibited from taking or refraining to take any police action motivated by bias or prejudice and should, when appropriate, strive to engage community members in a positive manner. &nbsp;Furthermore, members shall not profile or discriminate against any individual who is a member of a legally protected class.&nbsp; Legally protected classes, as defined by federal or state statute, as well as case law, include an individual&rsquo;s race, color, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, actual or perceived mental or physical disability, language (spoken or signed), marital or familial status, veteran status or any other protected status under law.</p>
<p>3. The Bureau is committed to policing in the most impartial manner possible.&nbsp; Therefore, regardless of protected status, members shall not profile or discriminate against any individual solely based on their membership in the following groups: housing status, socioeconomic status, immigration or refugee status, or political ideology or affiliation.</p>
<p>4. Public trust and confidence are the cornerstones of community policing.&nbsp; The Bureau recognizes that engaging in police acts that are rooted in bias is contrary to the values of the Bureau and erodes that trust and confidence, delegitimizes the Bureau, and ultimately undermines community policing efforts.</p>
<p>5. Members shall adhere to established legal, ethical, and best practice standards.&nbsp; The Bureau shall provide introductory and ongoing training to all sworn members that emphasizes developing an understanding of racial, ethnic, national, religious, cultural, and other differences and fosters the professional growth and continued development of members.&nbsp; &nbsp;Training of this nature is reinforced and incorporated throughout several disciplines and is intended to equip members with the necessary tools and techniques to police effectively, lawfully, and without bias, while also treating community members with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>6. The Bureau recognizes the reality of implicit bias, the scope of its potential influence on human behavior and, as it pertains to policing, how it can affect interactions and relationships between the Bureau and Portland&rsquo;s diverse communities.&nbsp; Therefore, the Bureau is committed to offering&nbsp;resources and&nbsp;instruction that help members identify and acknowledge their own subconscious perceptions or associated stereotypes about or attitudes towards people about which they may not be aware.&nbsp; In an effort to both minimize discriminatory practices and strengthen its relationship with the communities it serves, the Bureau will continue to work with members on an individual and collective basis to address how implicit biases may directly impact their work.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Procedure:</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bias-Based Policing and/or Profiling.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall police justly and impartially.&nbsp; Members shall not engage in bias-based policing or profiling.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members are permitted to consider status characteristics that are protected by law or Bureau policy when acting on a suspect description or information related to an identified or suspected violation of a provision of law.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a bias crime, as defined in ORS &sect;166.155 and 165.165, a member may consider an individual&rsquo;s class status that is otherwise protected by law or Bureau policy to the extent they are formulating reasonable suspicion or probable cause to investigate or arrest.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When investigating or charging under one of these statutes, members shall document the protected class status considered and the reason for doing so to establish reasonable suspicion or probable cause.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IPR Director is the City of Portland&rsquo;s responsible point of contact with the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IPR Director or designee will submit copies of all City-received profiling complaints to the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee and will intake any Committee-received profiling complaints from the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IPR Director or designee will notify the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee of disposition of the complaint.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee may collect and disseminate data regarding profiling and bias-based policing for statistical purposes, but is required to keep personally identifying information confidential.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain or designee shall ensure that the appropriate profiling complaint data is provided to the Law Enforcement Contacts Policy and Data Review Committee as described above. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Internal Complaints.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may file a complaint against another Bureau member.&nbsp; The member may report the alleged misconduct to anyone in or out of the chain of command (e.g., the Chief, Bureau of Human Resources [BHR], etc.).&nbsp; Individuals receiving a complaint shall forward the information directly to IA.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the circumstances warrant, the Bureau shall initiate an investigation, even in the absence of a complaint from an individual. &nbsp;Circumstances will warrant investigation when information regarding misconduct that has not been previously addressed and which, if true, could result in discipline.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the IA Captain, the Assistant Chief of Investigations, or a member of the Police Commissioner&rsquo;s staff receives information that a member has engaged in conduct that may be subject to criminal and/or administrative investigation, they shall notify the IPR Director in a timely manner.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IA and BHR shall jointly conduct investigations regarding allegations related to HRAR 2.02. &nbsp;The IA Captain, or designee, shall immediately notify the Chief when any investigations involving HRAR 2.02, Directive 310.20, Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Prohibited, or any other City Administrative Rule or Bureau directive the IA Captain deems appropriate are initiated. &nbsp;If allegations of misconduct involve the IA Captain and/or any other member of IA, the Chief shall be notified and shall designate a member of command staff to assume the role of the IA Captain and/or any other member of IA for all purposes related to the<br />investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once IA receives a complaint, the authority for process&shy;ing, investigating, or referring the complaint, unless the Chief directs otherwise in writing, is delegated by the Chief, to the IA Captain or designee. &nbsp;No Bureau official has the authority to stop, intercede in, suspend, or in any way direct and/or unduly influence the substance of an IA administrative investigation. &nbsp;When allegations of misconduct require immediate attention, supervisors shall initiate the necessary action and notify the IA Captain or designee and the appropriate Assistant Chief through the chain of command.</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation.</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The responding supervisor, or a designee, shall collect and document the following information, if available:</p>

<p>3. Complaint Processing and Assignment.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the restrictions and criteria set forth in this Directive, the IA Captain or designee shall process each complaint through one of the following means:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Investigation conducted by IA,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Investigation conducted by the Responsibility Unit (RU),</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigation by an outside entity, such as BHR, when IA has an actual conflict of interest or a special circumstance arises that, in the opinion of the IA Captain or designee, prohibits IA from conducting a timely or credible investigation,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisory Investigation,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mediation, or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Closure.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain or designee shall coordinate with the Assistant Chief of Investigations concerning all matters alleging criminal misconduct, in accordance with Directive 333.00, Criminal Investigations of Police Bureau Employees.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A case shall be assigned for administrative investigation when there is a prima facie allegation of conduct that, if true, violates one or more Bureau directives and could result in discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, IA investigators shall conduct IA investigations; however, the IA Captain or designee, when appropriate, may assign complaints to be investigated or resolved at the RU level.&nbsp; IA shall assign the case within seven days of receipt.&nbsp; In determining whether it is appropriate for an investigation to be conducted at the RU level, the IA Captain or designee shall consider the following criteria:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there could be a violation of criminal law,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seriousness of the allegation based on the level of potential discipline should the allegation be sustained,&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The involved member&rsquo;s complaint and discipline history,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the assignment to the RU presents a potential conflict of interest,</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The involved RU Manager&rsquo;s ability to conduct an investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegation formation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IA opens the case, they shall review the available material to determine which policies may have been violated.&nbsp; All alleged policy violations will be reflected in the investigation as allegations of misconduct.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Allegations will be written in such a way as to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.5.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accurately reflect the concerns of the complainant;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.5.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be phrased as violations of directives; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.5.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be specific enough to give the involved member notice of what misconduct they are being accused.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations are subject to changes as the investigation uncovers new information or if the original allegation was improperly framed.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All allegations against an involved member stemming from the same incident shall be investigated by a single investigative unit. &nbsp;The most serious allegation will govern the assignment of the case.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain or designee shall notify IPR of the processing and assignment of each complaint. &nbsp;If IPR disagrees with the decision, IPR will promptly notify the IA Captain, or designee. &nbsp;IPR has the authority to conduct the administrative investigation if the disagreement is not resolved.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IA is conducting an investigation at the time of the notification, IA shall cease its investigation and provide all investigative materials to IPR.</p>
<p>4. Notifications.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When IPR receives a complaint, IPR is responsible for providing each complainant and the involved member with a tracking number and informing each complainant of the allegation classification and assignment.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When IA opens a complaint, IA shall notify each complainant and the involved member of the allegation classification and assignment upon designating a case number.&nbsp; IA shall forward a copy of the notice to IPR.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IA shall notify the complainant if the case is internal (i.e., against a fellow member).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The information provided to the involved member shall be sufficient to reasonably apprise them of the nature of the allegation(s) in the complaint.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IA shall provide additional notification to each complainant and the involved member once the allegation has been framed.&nbsp; IA shall forward a copy of the second notification to IPR.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These notifications may be delayed in cases of criminal misconduct or where notification may compromise the integrity of an investigation.</p>
<p>5. Administrative Investigations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An IA investigator assigned an administrative investigation shall follow the procedures described in Directive 332.00, Administrative Investigations.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPR may choose to participate in an IA investigation without assuming the primary investigative role.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An RU investigator assigned an administrative investigation shall follow the procedures described in Directive 334.00, Performance Deficiencies, and Directive 332.00, Administrative Investigations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An IPR investigator assigned an administrative investigation follows IPR procedures.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPR may choose to conduct its own investigation. &nbsp;Pursuant to City Code, IPR has the authority to investigate cases of public interest which may include complaints involving:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crowd control;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disparate treatment or retaliation against a community member;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.3.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters that the IPR Director determines are in the public interest and over which IPR has jurisdiction under City code.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IPR notifies the IA Captain that they intend to conduct an independent investigation of any of the complaints listed in Section 5.3.1., IA shall not conduct a concurrent investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPR may request that IA participate in an IPR investigation, without relinquishing the primary investigative role.&nbsp; When requested, IA shall assist strictly in an administrative capacity and shall not perform any investigative functions unless IPR requests.</p>
<p>6. Supervisory Investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to Directive 331.00, Supervisory Investigations, supervisors shall investigate complaints against a member that, if sustained, would not result in corrective action greater than command counseling.</p>
<p>7. Mediation.</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the complainant is willing to engage in mediation, and the IPR Director and the IA Captain (or IA designee) conclude that mediation will meet the needs of the Police Bureau and the community, the involved member&rsquo;s RU Manager shall offer mediation to the involved officer. &nbsp;This option is contingent upon the mutual agreement of: the IA Captain (or designee), the involved member&rsquo;s RU Manager, the involved member(s), and the complainant. &nbsp;The IA Captain or designee, the involved member&rsquo;s RU Manager, or the involved member may decline an IPR recommenda&shy;tion to mediate a complaint.</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">7.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any portion of a complaint relates to the following, then the complaint will not be eligible for mediation:</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 90px;"">7.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations of excessive force by a member;</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 90px;"">7.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations of criminal conduct by a member; or</p>
<p class=""Pa5"" style=""padding-left: 90px;"">7.1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Circumstances in which the member is a witness against the complainant in a pending criminal or traffic prosecution.</p>
<p>8. Administrative Closure.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the exception of any allegation of excessive force and after initial investigation by either IA or IPR, the IA Captain or designee may administratively close an investigation after sufficient inquiry.&nbsp; In that circumstance, no further investigative action will be taken, although the IA Captain may refer the complaint to the appropriate RU Manager for an informal debriefing.&nbsp; The IA Captain may decline to conduct further investigation of an allegation contained within a complaint under the following circumstances as set forth in Administrative Rules PSF 5.01 and PSF 5.20:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Misconduct: &nbsp;The employee&rsquo;s conduct, as alleged by the complainant, does not violate Bureau policy.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trivial or <em>De Minimis</em> Rules Violation: &nbsp;The employee&rsquo;s conduct, as alleged by the complainant, constitutes a minor technical violation that, if sustained, would not result in discipline and is too minor or too vague to justify a Supervisory Investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No Jurisdiction: &nbsp;The complaint is against a non-employee, a former employee, or an employee of another department or other agency; or the employee resigns, retires, or shall no longer be employed by the Bureau by the time an investigation and disciplinary process could be completed. &nbsp;Even if the Bureau lacks jurisdiction, the IA Captain may decide to investigate a complaint based on the nature and seriousness of the allegations or based on a request from IPR or another law enforcement agency.&nbsp; For example, if serious misconduct has been alleged, the IA Captain may order an investigation so that the findings will be placed in the employee&rsquo;s personnel or IA file, forward the findings to another agency, review the actions of the employee&rsquo;s supervisors, or recommend a review of Bureau training or policies. &nbsp;Discipline may also be imposed if the employee returns to service.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Judicial Review: If it is likely that the investigation would focus on the action of a complainant such as an allegation that the complainant was improperly cited for a traffic infraction.&nbsp; Such cases are better addressed through legal proceedings where a court could place witnesses under oath, take live testimony, and render a decision.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unidentifiable Employee: &nbsp;A documented reasonable investigative effort was not able to identify the (involved) employee.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously Investigated or Adjudicated: &nbsp;The alleged conduct was previously investigated or adjudicated by the Bureau and the current complaint does not provide substantially new evidence or allegations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lacks Investigative Merit: &nbsp;The IA Captain or designee must articulate specific reasons why the complaint is not credible or reliable.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">8.1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Complainant Delayed Too Long in Filing the Complaint to Justify Present Investigation:&nbsp; Complaints alleging significant misconduct will not be dismissed due to a delay in filing.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases in which an investigation is administratively closed, IA will prepare an explanation and send it to IPR so the complainant can be advised.&nbsp; If the investigation is administratively closed because the involved officer is an employee of a different agency, IA will refer the complainant to that agency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Criminal Complaints Involving Members.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">9.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allegations of member misconduct, which include a possible criminal law viola&shy;tion, shall be investigated concurrently as a criminal and administrative investigation. &nbsp;Criminal cases involving members shall be processed according to Directive 333.00, Criminal Investigations of Police Bureau Employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Unlawful Employment Practices, Discrimination Complaints, and Equal Employment Opportunities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">10.1.&nbsp; Complaints by members alleging unlawful employment practices shall be processed according to the City&rsquo;s Human Resource Administrative Rule 2.02, Prohibition Against Workplace Harassment, Discrimination, and Retaliation and Directive 310.20, Discrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation Prohibited.</p>
<p>11. Personnel Performance Deficiencies.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">11.1.&nbsp; Complaints regarding job performance problems or minor work rule violations may be processed according to the procedures in Directive 334.00, Performance Deficiencies.</p>
<p>12. Disposition Notification.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">12.1.&nbsp; If the complainant is a community member, IA shall write a disposition letter.&nbsp; The letter shall explain the investigation and findings or administrative closure.&nbsp; IA shall provide the letter to IPR within seven days of completion of the Police Review Board (PRB) for IPR&rsquo;s use to notify the complainant.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">12.1.1.&nbsp; If the complainant is a Bureau member, IA shall notify the individual and IPR directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">12.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any changes in the findings occur as a result of proceedings relating to the collective bargaining agreement between the City and the labor organizations that represent sworn members of the Police Bureau, or as a result of administrative or judicial review, IA shall write a new disposition letter to follow up with the complainant as permitted by law. &nbsp;The complainant shall be notified of the new findings as described in Section 12.1. and 12.1.1. of this directive.</p>
<p>13. Liability Management.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">13.1.&nbsp; If an officer&rsquo;s use of force gives rise to a finding of liability in a civil trial, PPB shall: (1) enter that civil liability finding in the EIS; (2) reevaluate the officer&rsquo;s fitness to participate in all current and prospective specialized units; (3) if no IA investigation has previously been conducted based upon the same allegation of misconduct and reached an administrative finding, conduct a full IA investigation with the civil trial finding creating a rebuttable presumption that the force used also violated PPB policy, which presumption can only be overcome by specific, credible evidence by a preponderance of evidence; (4) if an IA investigation has already concluded based upon the same allegation of misconduct and failed to reach a sustained finding, identify whether any new evidence exists in the record of the civil trial to justify the reopening of the IA investigation, and if so, reinitiate an IA investigation; and (5) if an IA investigation has already concluded based upon the same allegation of misconduct and failed to reach a sustained finding, and no new evidence from the civil trial justifies reopening the IA investigation, work with IPR to identify the reason why the administrative finding was contrary to the civil trial finding and publish a summary of the results of the inquiry.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">13.2.&nbsp; Police liability management may review closed IA cases for compliance with policy, rules, and procedures related to the review of claims against the Bureau.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Definitions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Counseling: &nbsp;A formal non-disciplinary corrective action that involves verbal counseling in response to a sustained finding for a minor policy violation.&nbsp; Command counseling is conducted by the Responsibility Unit (RU) manager or a designee and is documented in a memo to Internal Affairs (IA).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Complaint:&nbsp; Any complaint made to the City by a member of the public, a PPB officer, or a civilian PPB employee of alleged misconduct by a Bureau member.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Misconduct:&nbsp; Conduct by a member that violates Bureau regulations, orders, directives, or other standards of conduct required of City employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisory Investigation (SI): A formal, non-disciplinary process where the involved member&rsquo;s supervisor is tasked with reviewing a complaint stating a member provided poor quality of service or committed a rule violation that, if substantiated, would not result in corrective action greater than command counseling.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervisory Investigation Findings:&nbsp; A conclusion, based upon a preponderance of evidence, as to whether a member&rsquo;s conduct violated Bureau directives.&nbsp; A &ldquo;substantiated&rdquo; finding means that the evidence was sufficient to prove a violation of directives.&nbsp; A &ldquo;not substantiated&rdquo; finding means that either: the evidence was insufficient to prove a violation of directives; the act described by the complainant occurred, but was within policy; or the allegation was demonstrably false.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p>1. The Portland Police Bureau and the Independent Police Review (IPR) will work together to address complaints of poor service quality and/or rule violations, in an effort to promote and underscore the importance of individual and organizational accountability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The goals of the supervisory investigation (SI) process are to improve Bureau service delivery by addressing community member concerns in a timely manner and to review and correct member behavior that may violate established rules not rising to the level of an IA investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Receipt of Complaint.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IPR, IA, or any member may receive complaints from community members alleging minor rule violations or poor quality of service.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to Directive 330.00, Internal Affairs, Complaint Intake, and Processing, members shall submit all complaints, including those that allege poor quality of service or a rule violation, to IA.</p>
<p>2. IA Captain Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain or designee may assign for SI those complaints which, if proven, could result in no more than command counseling.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complaints alleging disparate treatment, use of force, criminal conduct, or any misconduct which, if substantiated, would result in discipline will not be handled as an SI.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complaints against members who have already received a substantiated SI finding or sustained administrative investigation finding within the last calendar year regarding the same or similar type of misconduct shall not be eligible for assignment as an SI, and shall instead be assigned as an administrative investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain shall track SIs and ensure RU Managers complete them in the prescribed timeline.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of a complaint meeting the SI criteria, the IA Captain or designee shall notify IPR and assign the SI to the involved member&rsquo;s RU for resolution.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the RU Manager returns the completed SI Resolution Memorandum, the IA Captain or designee will review and either:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return the case to the RU for any additional information or action needed; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review the memorandum and forward the case to IPR. &nbsp;Upon final case review from IPR, the IA Captain or designee shall close the Internal Affairs case file.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IA Captain or designee shall maintain case files for all completed SI cases through the retention period pursuant to Directive 332.00, Administrative Investigations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIs are non-disciplinary in nature and, therefore, shall not be placed in a member&rsquo;s personnel file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. RU Manager Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon receipt of an SI, assign the case to a supervisor.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review the supervisor&rsquo;s findings prior to the supervisor disclosing the result of the investigation to the involved member.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review all completed SI case files for completeness and forward them to Internal Affairs once approved.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure that SIs are completed within 21 days of receipt at the RU, unless extended in writing for good cause shown.</p>
<p>4. Investigating Supervisor Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify specific quality of service issues and/or alleged minor rules violations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review all available reports, Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) entries, videos, photographs, and other relevant documentation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a good faith effort to contact the complainant to discuss the complaint. &nbsp;Generally, supervisors should make at least three attempts at contacting the complainant prior to discussing the complaint with the involved member(s).</p>

<p class=""Pa5CxSpFirst""><strong>&nbsp;<strong>Policy: </strong></strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this directive is to provide guidance to members regarding the process for recommending and assigning corrective or disciplinary action when an allegation of a policy violation or misconduct against a member is sustained.</p>
<p>2. In order to maintain public confidence in the ability of the Police Bureau to investigate and properly address legitimate complaints concerning employee conduct and performance, and to ensure internal accountability, a broad range of tools are available to set expectations, issue corrective action, and institute discipline. &nbsp;The Bureau has a responsibility to impose corrective or disciplinary action when warranted by a member&rsquo;s violation of policy.</p>
<p>3. The Bureau&rsquo;s philosophy with respect to corrective action and discipline is the same philosophy that is applied to employees who work elsewhere in the City, which is that corrective and disciplinary action are tools available to assist supervisors in working with employees whose behavior or job performance does not meet the expectations associated with the position they hold. &nbsp;Corrective action or discipline can be used to correct behavior, to deter a violation of policies or procedures, and to hold employees accountable for their behavior or performance. &nbsp;Generally speaking, corrective action or discipline is used to put the employee on notice of unacceptable conduct or performance, and give the employee a reasonable opportunity to correct their behavior. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Generally, discipline is progressive, beginning with an oral warning or Letter of Reprimand and proceeding to suspension, demotion, or termination.&nbsp; Serious offenses may result in termination, even if there has been no prior warnings, attempts at corrective action or disciplinary action. Serious offenses include, but are not limited to, criminal or other unlawful acts, abuse of authority, theft, untruthfulness, excessive force, failure to follow orders, unlawful discrimination, workplace harassment, retaliation, creation of a hostile work environment, or workplace violence and may justify suspension or termination without the necessity of progressive discipline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. In certain cases, as defined in City Code 3.20.140, the Bureau and member may both agree to the appropriate disciplinary action to allow for a more timely resolution, i.e., Stipulated Discipline.</p>
<p>6. In all cases, the level and degree of discipline shall be in keeping with the seriousness of the offense, taking into account the circumstances relevant to the case.&nbsp; It is not the purpose of this directive to require an automatic progression of disciplinary measures.&nbsp; Rather, the circumstances of each situation are considered on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; The Discipline Guide serves to ensure that corrective action and discipline are applied in an impartial and consistent manner.</p>
<p>7. Before the Bureau takes corrective action or disciplinary action, the Bureau or IPR will conduct a thorough investigation to assist it in determining whether the employee, in fact, engaged in misconduct or performance that is contrary to Bureau directives and policies.</p>
<p class=""Pa5CxSpMiddle"">8. Members are subject to disciplinary action for cause or just cause. &nbsp;Possible disciplinary actions are identified in Human Resources Administrative Rule 5.01 - Discipline, the Discipline Guide, or the applicable collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>9. Counseling, instruction, and training are not considered disciplinary action.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Those responsible for making recommendations on findings and discipline shall refer to the Discipline Guide in accordance with Directive 338.00, Discipline Guide.</li>
</ol>

<p>2. While this directive provides guidance to members regarding the PRB hearing process, Portland City Code 3.20.140, Police Review Board, more thoroughly delineates the purpose, authority and composition of the PRB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>Procedure: </strong></strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powers of the PRB.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall not leave their assignments for an excessive amount of time and will manage their time reasonably for breaks and lunch. &nbsp;Supervisors will ensure that sufficient members are available to carry out the assigned duties of the precinct or division. &nbsp;Supervisors are also required to ensure that no more than two uniform patrol vehicles are at the same location while on a lunch or break, unless that supervisor approved a greater number to be present.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who come into contact with stranded individuals or motorists in need of assistance (e.g., vehicle towed on freeway) shall offer assistance to the person(s) and make every attempt to facilitate their safe removal from the area without compromising the member&rsquo;s safety.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.10.&nbsp; Members shall report for duty, unless exempt by their supervisor, at the time and place required by assignment or orders. &nbsp;Members are subject to an emergency recall at any time by their supervisor and shall comply when notified to report for duty. &nbsp;(Trial notices processed through the Court Coordinator&rsquo;s office and any work related judicial subpoenas constitute an order to report for duty under this section.)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.11.&nbsp; Members unable to remain awake while on duty shall notify their supervisor, who will determine the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.12.&nbsp; Members shall refrain from conducting personal business while on duty.&nbsp; Members will request time off in advance to conduct personal business or seek supervisor approval if it becomes necessary for the member to be out of service for an extended period of time.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who do not demonstrate the ability or knowledge necessary to perform their job-related duties shall be evaluated in accordance with Directive 334.00, Performance Deficiencies.</p>
<p>2. Satisfactory performance during confrontation management:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; This subsection sets performance standards for decision-making during confrontations, and requires that members use sound tactics and good decision-making during a confrontation and work diligently toward applying, when practical, less force than the maximum allowed by the constitutional standard and minimizing or avoiding force when possible. &nbsp;This subsection also requires members to develop and display over the course of their practice of law enforcement good confrontation and force management skills.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau requires that members be capable of using effective force on behalf of the public, when appropriate, to manage the risks of confrontations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the intention of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible with as little reliance on force as practical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau places a high value on resolving confrontations, when practical, with less force than the maximum that may be allowed by law.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; When managing a confrontation, members must make confrontation management decisions based on available options reasonably calculated to resolve the confrontation safely and effectively, with as little reliance on force as practical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; In applying this standard to a member&rsquo;s performance, the Bureau shall evaluate the member&rsquo;s decision making from the perspective of the member at the moment the decisions were made. This confrontation management standard is separate from and does not modify the use-of-force standard in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force. &nbsp;The relevant inquiry for this confrontation management standard is whether the member pursued the Bureau&rsquo;s goal of resolving a confrontation safely and effectively with as little reliance on force as practical and whether there is a valid reasoning in the member&rsquo;s confrontation management decision-making.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of their practice of law enforcement, members must develop and display the skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations without resorting to the higher levels of force allowed by the constitutional standard.</p>
<p>3. Supervisor Performance During Critical Incidents</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors at any rank should prioritize their supervisory perspective and avoid tactical involvement in incidents to the extent possible, under the totality of the circumstances, if there are a sufficient number of officers available and capable of fulfilling a particular tactical role. Supervisors who are not serving as the incident commander may take a tactical role at the direction of the incident commander. Nothing herein prohibits supervisors from taking immediate law enforcement action when objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. In applying this standard to a supervisor&rsquo;s performance, the Bureau shall evaluate the member&rsquo;s decision-making from the perspective of the supervisor at the moment the decisions were made.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any findings based on an Internal Affairs (IA) case or After Action review of a critical incident must include a finding as to whether the involvement of all supervisors at any rank was consistent with Bureau training and policy.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau recognizes modified duty assignments create a mutual benefit to both the Bureau and the member by providing the member with the ability to continue working while also providing the Bureau with a productive employee during the interim period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTIVE SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;MODIFIED DUTY ASSIGNMENT: a work assignment not requiring performance of the full range of duties associated with a member's regular job classification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;POLICY</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau will make reasonable efforts to establish modified duty assignments to allow members to return to work during an interim period when they are temporarily unable to perform the duties associated with their job classification due to illness, injury, or pregnancy. Additionally, the Bureau may identify a limited number of modified duty assignments for members whose restrictions are of a more permanent nature and prevent them from performing the duties associated with their regular job classification.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The designation of modified duty assignments is discretionary and the designation may be reverted at any time to full duty assignments. The allocation will be determined based on the operational and business needs of the Bureau, including the need to provide efficient and effective public safety services, as well as budget and staffing requirements.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;REQUESTS FOR MODIFIED-DUTY ASSIGNMENTS</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests for a modified-duty assignment may be made by any member who has incurred a short-term disability or whose restrictions are of a permanent nature and prevent the member from performing the duties of their regular job classification, and the disability and/or restrictions are a result of either a service or non-service connected incident.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Requests should be made through channels and in writing to the member&rsquo;s RU Manager.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The RU Manager will forward the request to the Personnel Division Manager who will evaluate the request and determine if a modified duty assignment is within the member's job analysis limitations as determined by a qualified medical professional, and available in accordance with the staffing guidelines outlined in the Personnel Division's Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;ASSIGNMENT ALLOCATION &nbsp;PROCEDURE</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Division is responsible for maintaining an SOP outlining the procedure for allotment of modified duty positions, ensuring that it establishes procedures and guidelines that meet the Bureau's current operational and business needs. The SOP will be regularly maintained to ensure adherence to any Bureau obligations established under state law, city administrative rules, FPDR guidelines, collective bargaining agreements, or any other applicable city policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;PROBATIONARY MEMBERS</p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary members who are assigned to a temporary modified duty assignment will have their probation extended by a period of time equal to the member's assignment to modified duty.</p>

<p class=""WordSection2"">7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Member Responsibilities</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members assigned to a modified duty assignment will notify their immediate supervisor, as well as the FPDR Liaison if they are assigned to a unit other than the Personnel Division's Operation Support Unit (OSU), of any change in their condition that modifies the original medical release.</p>

<p class=""WordSection2"">7.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members assigned to a modified duty assignment are expected to meet the conduct and performance expectations of the assignment.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who are considering refusing a modified duty assignment that is within their restrictions should consider the potential consequences of a refusal. Refusal could subject the member to disciplinary action and ineligibility for disability benefits. Disability benefits or workers' compensation payment decisions are solely within FPDR's or Risk Management's decision making authority.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisors &nbsp;Responsibilities</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisors will forward requests for modified duty assignments through channels.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personnel Division Responsibilities</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.3.1.&nbsp; Personnel Division will maintain an SOP outlining the modified-duty procedures.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">7.3.2.&nbsp; All members working under a modified duty contract will initially report to the OSU Sergeant and submit all FPDR related paperwork to the OSU Sergeant until they are released to full duty or the contract ends.</p>

<p class=""WordSection2"">7.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases, RU managers will ensure that all members who are in a modified duty assignment for more than 14 days are placed on a modified duty contract.</p>
<p>7.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member is reassigned to OSU under a temporary off street assignment contract, it remains the RU manager's responsibility to develop and implement a plan to improve the member's performance.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">7.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a member is reassigned to OSU and working under a written performance improvement plan, the RU manager responsible for that plan will provide the OSU Sergeant with a copy of the plan so the OSU Sergeant may coordinate the member's compliance with the plan while they are assigned to OSU.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURN TO FULL DUTY PROCEDURES</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member on a modified duty assignment released to full duty must submit a release from a qualified medical professional. A member who is on service connected disability, non-service connected disability or workers' compensation is expected to comply with FPDR or Risk Management requirements, if applicable.</p>

For members being considered for a modified duty assignment, the Personnel Division, in consultation with the Bureau, is also authorized to require an examination.</p>
<p>9.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The availability of a modified duty assignment does not affect a member's eligibility for a leave of absence for an injury or illness that is sustained in the line of duty or any other form of leave that the member may be eligible for under City Administrative Rules and state or federal law (i.e. Family and Medical Leave Act).</p>
<p>9.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;A member who is in a modified duty assignment for medical reasons is not prohibited from applying for promotion through the regular City civil service process. A member who is otherwise qualified may be eligible for promotion if:</p>

<p>9.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is released to perform the essential functions by an appropriate medical professional prior to the effective date of the promotion and;</p>
<p>9.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The available assignment is in the rank in which the promotional vacancy exists.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau recognizes a diverse workforce is a valuable asset, and the availability of trained and experienced police officers is a critical resource. The Bureau will not assume a member is unable to continue her regular job functions solely because she is pregnant.</p>

<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;This policy is not intended to interfere with a sworn member's rights under federal, state, or local law; or any other city administrative rule or collective bargaining agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTIVE SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;JOB ANALYSIS: Includes two components: (1) Job tasks within a job classification identified by the Bureau that may be performed by a member who is eligible for a modified duty assignment; and (2) a physical and/or mental capacities assessment of a modified duty assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;POLICY</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;During a pregnancy, upon written recommendation of a physician, a sworn member may request a temporary modified duty assignment.</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bureau is committed to assigning members to a modified duty assignment for reasons relating to pregnancy, whenever possible. However there may be circumstances when the Bureau must limit such assignments based on the operational and business needs of the Bureau.</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personnel Division will be responsible for maintaining an SOP outlining the procedure for placing eligible sworn members in a modified duty assignment for reasons relating to pregnancy. The SOP will establish procedures and guidelines that meet the Bureau's current policies, operational and budget needs, and the needs of the member.</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The SOP will be regularly reviewed to ensure adherence to any Bureau obligations established under federal, state and local law, city administrative rules, FPDR guidelines, collective bargaining agreements, or any other applicable city policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;SWORN MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Pregnant member may request modified duty assignments through her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A member requesting a modified duty assignment will submit a statement from her health care provider verifying the pregnancy and specifying any applicable restrictions or limitations at work.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;A job analysis by a qualified medical professional is required to determine if the modified duty assignment is within the member's restrictions or limitations.</p>
<p>4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;If at any point during the pregnancy it becomes necessary for the member to take a leave of absence, such leave will be processed consistent with the Human Resources Administrative Rules regarding Family Medical Leave.</p>
<p>4.5.&nbsp; In all cases, members who are in a modified duty assignment for more than 14 days must be placed on a modified duty contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of a request for a temporary job accommodation, reassignment or leave, the supervisor shall notify the Branch Chief through channels.

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>- Critical Incident: &nbsp;An atypically traumatic event that may cause physical, emotional, and/or psychological injury or harm</p>
<p>- Critical Incident Stress Debriefing: &nbsp;A process that is designed to prevent or limit the development of post-traumatic stress in people exposed to critical incidents. &nbsp;It is a professionally conducted debriefing that helps members cope with and recover from an incident&rsquo;s aftereffects. &nbsp;It enables participants to process their thoughts and feelings surrounding a critical incident in a controlled, safe environment.</p>
<p>- Involved Member: &nbsp;An involved member is a Bureau member who applies deadly force or directs another to use deadly physical force, or a member who has used physical force against, or a member who assumes control, care or custody of, a subject who dies in police custody.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Witness Member: A witness member is a Bureau member who observes or has firsthand knowledge of the events surrounding an in-custody death or the use of deadly physical force by another member, and other than observing the incident, did not use deadly physical force. &nbsp;Additionally, a member who observes or has firsthand knowledge of the events surrounding a member&rsquo;s direction to another to use deadly force.</p>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p>1.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Bureau recognizes that critical incidents are extremely complex and can have significant impact on the involved and witness members, the organization, and the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The Bureau is committed to supporting members who are involved in or witness a deadly force incident. &nbsp;Members directly involved in the use of deadly force (or force resulting in serious injury as determined by the Chief of Police) will be placed on administrative leave and/or provided a structured, temporary altered assignment to facilitate the member returning to their regular duty.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1. Altered Duty for Involved Members:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;Involved members in a use of deadly force or in-custody death event will be placed on administrative leave immediately following an event. &nbsp;This work status will stay in place until the involved member attends a session with a licensed mental health professional. &nbsp;If this session occurs prior to one week after the end of the Grand Jury deliberations, the involved member will not return to work until one week after Grand Jury deliberations. &nbsp;This procedure recognizes the difficulty in processing such an event by a member until after the completion of the Grand Jury deliberations.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;Members who need more time off work may use vacation or sick leave, if applicable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;If a member feels unable to return to work, they may file a claim under the Fire and Police Disability and Retirement System.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;The involved member&rsquo;s Lieutenant will be responsible for keeping the member informed of the details of their temporary assignment. &nbsp;This procedure recognizes the value in the member receiving official communication in a timely, accurate, and regular manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;Involved members will return to work at the conclusion of the administrative leave and after the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6.&nbsp;The involved member&rsquo;s return to work will be structured in a manner designed to continue to facilitate the member smoothly returning to their full duty assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Return to Work for Involved Members:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;The first week of the structured return to duty assignment will include being paired with another member for a minimum of the first week. &nbsp;This procedure recognizes the benefit of being back with the involved member&rsquo;s usual peers as well as being able to step back into the demands of the job in a progressive manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;The first day will be administrative in nature and will include such things as obtaining back the involved member&rsquo;s weapon and equipment, visiting the range if desired, and visiting the scene of occurrence if desired.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;If the involved member is in an operational assignment, the rest of the week will involve working in a two person &ldquo;beat&rdquo; car and taking non-priority calls. &nbsp;The intent is for the involved member to not have district responsibilities for the first week and to take calls in a self-initiated and controlled manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;If the involved member is in a non-operational assignment, a similar stair step approach assignment will be structured.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5.&nbsp;At the end of the first week, the involved member, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Coordinator, and the member&rsquo;s supervisor will make a determination if the member is ready for a complete return to unrestricted duty or decide if there would be additional benefit by continuing to be paired with a partner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Witness Member:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;Members that witness (as defined within this Directive) the use of deadly force may be placed on administrative leave and/or placed in a temporary altered duty assignment following such an incident. &nbsp;This may also be referred to the EAP Coordinator and assigned a Traumatic Incident Committee or Peer Support Team member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;These decisions, as well as the return to work process, will be determined on a case by case basis by the Assistant Chief of the witness member in consultation with the EAP Coordinator, the witness member, and their assigned Traumatic Incident Committee or Peer Support Team member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;This procedure recognizes that witnessing such an event, though not being directly involved in the use of deadly force, can still have a significant impact on members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Members involved in all other types of critical incidents may be placed on administrative leave with the approval of the Chief or their designee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. EAP Coordinator:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1.&nbsp;The EAP Coordinator provides support and assistance to members involved in a critical incident by partnering them with peer-support groups; referring them to licensed mental health providers; conducting follow-ups; advocating on their behalf to command staff for additional time off, if necessary; and coordinating their return to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2.&nbsp;Following the use of deadly force or in-custody death, the EAP Coordinator will:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.2.1.&nbsp;Ensure that all involved members are assigned a Traumatic Incident Committee team member as soon as practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.2.2.&nbsp;Refer members to licensed mental health providers and ensure the involved member(s) is both scheduled for and attends a session prior to returning to work.&nbsp; The EAP Coordinator will also schedule members&rsquo; sessions at three, six, and twelve months following the incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3. The EAP Coordinator is responsible for scheduling the Critical Incident Stress Debriefing following any critical incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.1.&nbsp;Critical Incident Stress Debriefings for use of deadly force or in-custody death events will occur as soon as practical following the conclusion of any criminal proceedings (e.g., Grand Jury). &nbsp;This procedure recognizes the value in conducting this debriefing as soon as is procedurally possible.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.2.&nbsp;Critical Incident Stress Debriefings for all other critical incidents shall occur within a week of the event or as soon as practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Exceptional Circumstances:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1.&nbsp;In exceptional circumstances, the Chief of Police or their designee, reserves the ability to have a member remain on administrative leave beyond the time periods outlined in this directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.2.&nbsp;The Chief of Police, also reserves the ability to assign a member to a non-call taking assignment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.3.&nbsp;Factors that will be considered in making such determinations include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.1.&nbsp;Member concerns,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.2.&nbsp;Threats to members and family members,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.3.&nbsp;Media coverage,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.4.&nbsp;Community concerns,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.5.&nbsp;Grand Jury returning a true bill for a criminal indictment, and/or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.3.6.&nbsp;There is an objective basis for the Chief of Police to believe that the member may be terminated from employment.</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (670.00)</strong></p>
<p>All members will take appropriate action when summoned to the TriMet system on reported criminal, civil, or order maintenance situations. Additionally, members using TriMet&rsquo;s services will exercise discretion in the event circumstances arise which require police action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURES (670.00)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Transit Police Division (Transit Police): A division within the Bureau under contract with TriMet to perform law enforcement duties for the TriMet system.</p>
<p>TriMet System: The Portland metropolitan area transportation system which includes, but is not limited to, bus, train, train platform, and all property and equipment owned, leased or controlled by TriMet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Authority (670.00)</strong></p>
<p>TriMet Ordinance 28.20(c) provides all peace officers of the State of Oregon the authority to issue citations, as provided by Oregon law, to any person who violates any provision of TriMet Code 28.15. Violations of TriMet ordinances are infractions and therefore subject only to citation issuance.</p>
<p>TriMet fare inspectors are not members of a criminal justice agency. Therefore, members will not provide them with LEDS information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sworn Member Responsibilities (670.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Issuance of Citations: Persons who are charged with violating TriMet codes commit an infraction and will be cited into the Circuit Court of venue through the issuance of a Z cite (See DIR 870.20 for cite definitions.).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Exclusions: Any sworn member may exclude persons who violate any provision of the TriMet code or state statute as it relates to TriMet. Members deciding to exclude a violator from the TriMet system will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Complete a TriMet Notice of Exclusion form.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Issue the excluded person his/her copy of the exclusion form, and a copy of Exhibit D.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete and sign the affidavit portion of the form (if additional police reports are written make note of that fact on the affidavit).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fax a copy of the front of the Notice of Exclusion, and a copy of the affidavit to the TriMet Exclusion Administrator within 48 hours. The fax number is printed on the bottom of the Notice of Exclusion.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Forward all original reports and forms through normal channels to the Records Division (Records). Note: The length of the exclusion will be based upon the conduct of the person being excluded. Each exclusion has the TriMet code violation and length of the exclusion printed on the front of the form. All exclusions will be subject to an automatic stay of ten business days, following the date of issuance.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Interfering with Public Transportation based on Current Exclusion: A Person may be arrested for Interfering with Public Transportation, ORS 166.116 if the person intentionally or knowingly enters or remains on TriMet property and an exclusion is verified to be current through the TriMet system. To determine if the person is excluded at the time of contact, members can contact TriMet dispatch on their radio channel or by phone. The phone number is available in the Problem Solving Resource Guide. Persons who are found to be presently excluded from the system may be charged with Interfering with Public Transportation if:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;They have not had the exclusion period rescinded by the TriMet Hearings Officer.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;They have not been granted a variance to allow for school or occupational travel. If a variance has been granted the excluded person is required to have a letter on his/her person indicating the terms of the variance (Interfering with Public Transportation replaces Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree for situations on public transportation property).</p>

PED will maintain a list of requests for transfer of unclaimed property. Selection of items will be at the discretion of the PED manager or designee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests for Donating Surplus Property (660.20)</strong></p>
<p>City Code 5.36.010 allows the Police Bureau to donate surplus property to the State of Oregon Surplus Property Program, other public agencies, or to certified charitable organizations.

<p><strong>PROCEDURE (660.15)</strong></p>
<p>When property located at a Pawnshop or licensed Secondhand Dealer is believed to be lost or stolen or evidence of any crime, members may place a police hold on such property and initiate an inquiry as follows:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the property has not been reported lost or stolen or as evidence of any crime and investigation reveals it is, initiate an investigation report. &nbsp;A copy of this report will be directed to Special Property Investigations (SPI).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Notify the place of business that a 30 day police hold is being placed on the property and that they should follow the procedures described in City Ordinance 14B.90 (Secondhand Dealers).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If the property has already been reported as lost or stolen or as evidence of any crime, a Special Report justifying the police hold will be written for inclusion with the case file in the Records Division (Records). A copy of this report will be directed to SPI. The police hold will remain in effect for 30 days unless the property is released, the verbal hold renewed, placed on Formal Hold or seized by SPI.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;If the place of business is not open during the member&rsquo;s working hours, a police hold may be accomplished by directing a request to SPI.</p>
<p>Members, other than SPI members or those authorized by SPI, will not remove suspect property from a Pawnshop or licensed Secondhand Dealer, nor will they return the property to the alleged owner. Property removed from a Pawnshop or licensed Secondhand Dealer will be documented on a Property/Evidence Receipt and handled according to existing Bureau guidelines.</p>
<p>Citizen inquiries will be referred to SPI. Outside agencies that need to place police holds on property located at a Pawnshop or licensed Secondhand Dealer will be referred to SPI for assistance. Members should advise the agency placing the police hold that they will be expected to provide SPI with a copy of the police report regarding the loss/theft and any suspect information.</p>
<p>Formal holds and property seizures from a Pawnshop or licensed Secondhand Dealer will only be conducted after SPI has received a copy of the police report regarding the loss/theft and any suspect information regarding the crime for which the property is believed to be evidence.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/529181

<p><strong>POLICY (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>A search warrant should be obtained for all searches whenever there is time to do so and when there is any doubt about the necessity of obtaining a warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>Any magistrate authorized to issue a warrant of arrest may issue a search warrant for:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Evidence of, or information concerning, the commission of a criminal offense.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Property that constitutes contraband or items otherwise criminally possessed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Fruits of a crime (see ORS 133.535).</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property that has been used, or is possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of an offense.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;A person for whose arrest there is probable cause or who is unlawfully held in concealment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Search Warrant Issuance (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Application for a search warrant may be made by a district attorney or by any police officer. Search warrants and affidavits will normally be written by the member requesting the warrant. Warrant preparation will be coordinated with the appropriate investigative unit.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Search warrants are only issued upon a finding of probable cause to believe that an offense has or will be committed. The probable cause is based upon the member&rsquo;s personal knowledge and/or hearsay information from another member, a named citizen or undisclosed informant. The probable cause is relayed to the magistrate through use of an affidavit. The affidavit should:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Contain a clear and distinct description of the place(s) to be searched and the item(s) to be seized.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide facts and circumstances which provide probable cause for the search. This includes:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Information justifying the search; and</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Information leading to the belief that the object(s) of the search are in the places or the possession of the subject(s) to be searched.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before issuing the warrant, the magistrate will need to be satisfied that probable cause exists. The magistrate may examine the affiant or any witnesses under oath.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Prior to the issuance of a search warrant, a magistrate may request that a meeting be arranged at a time and place convenient for all parties involved, so the magistrate can interview any informant(s) contributing information towards the probable cause.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;When hearsay information of an undisclosed confidential informant is relied upon to establish probable cause, that information must be independently corroborated (i.e., information demonstrating past reliability of the informant or by personal observation and corroboration).</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; An ongoing chronological record will be maintained of each informant&rsquo;s activities and reliability by those divisions issuing evidence/informant funds. This file is to be reviewed by a supervisor prior to requesting a search warrant based on an informant&rsquo;s reliability. Members will comply with DIRs 660.00 and 660.32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Search Warrant Checklist (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>A search warrant checklist has been adopted by the Bureau, the Multnomah County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office and MultnomahCounty court magistrates.</p>
<p>This checklist is available on the Bureau&rsquo;s Intranet. Included on the checklist is a section indicating the investigator has conducted a check through Oregon State Intelligence Network (OSIN) to ensure that the warrant address is not currently the subject of an investigation by another agency and/or division.</p>
<p>The check is mandatory, and will be done prior to the issuance of any search warrant. This form will be used for all MultnomahCounty search warrants obtained by the Bureau. Members should follow warrant application and return procedures for other counties as instructed by local magistrates.</p>
<p>A supervisor should review the probable cause, informant reliability, and the search warrant affidavit prior to its submission to the DA&rsquo;s office. A deputy district attorney (DDA), from the appropriate county, will review every search warrant affidavit in person, by telephone or by email.</p>
<p>A copy of the search warrant and the original affidavit will be left with the issuing magistrate. Search warrants will be served as soon as possible. Extended delay of service is to be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Threat Assessment and Planning (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>All search warrant executions involving a potential threat to members or citizens require a Planned Operations Risk Assessment form be completed prior to execution. This form is available on the Bureau&rsquo;s Intranet.</p>
<p>Examples of a threat might include, but not be limited to, violent suspects, animals, obstacles causing a delay to securing the search location, or even a lack of information about the location to be searched.</p>
<p>The supervisor responsible for the search warrant execution is responsible for the proper completion of the risk assessment form and any other necessary planning to ensure the safe and effective service of the warrant. The supervisor will ensure that the SERT commander, or designee, will be consulted, as required by the completed Planned Operations Risk Assessment form. This will assist the evaluation for need of SERT and/or HNT in the execution of the warrant.</p>
<p>If SERT/HNT are needed or requested, the SERT commander, or designee, will coordinate with HNT and the originating division/unit commander or designee, to ensure all tactical considerations have been discussed. The original completed risk assessment form, if not forwarded to SERT as a request for their services, will be retained in the investigator&rsquo;s case file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Execution of the Warrant (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Only a police officer may serve a search warrant. Generally, execution of a search warrant is restricted to between 0700 and 2200 hours unless it is otherwise endorsed on the warrant by the issuing magistrate.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;A warrant is generally valid for five days after the date of its issuance. If the warrant is not executed within this period, it is void. A new affidavit must be filed and new search warrant issued. The issuing magistrate may, however, authorize execution of the warrant for up to ten days after its issuance. This authorization must be specified on the face of the warrant. Before entering any premises, the executing member will knock and give appropriate notice of identity, authority and purpose to the person to be searched or to the person in apparent control of the premises to be searched. If the member is not admitted after such notification, force may be used to enter the premises. In emergency situations, a no-knock entry may be performed (i.e., where members or others are at risk of bodily harm or where evidence may be destroyed). If such entry occurs, the circumstances leading to the entry will be clearly articulated in the incident report form. If it is determined that no one is at the residence, members have the authority to forcibly enter (see DIR 631.60). Before undertaking any search or seizure pursuant to the warrant, the executing member will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Read and give a copy of the warrant (not the affidavit) to the person to be searched, or to the person in apparent control of the premises to be searched.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Affix a copy of the warrant to the premises if the premises are unoccupied, or there is no one in apparent control.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of executing a search warrant, the member may take reasonable precautions to ensure that property will not be removed while the search is being conducted and to prevent interference with the search. Members have the same power and authority in all respects to break open any door or window and to use all necessary and proper means to overcome any forcible resistance as they do in executing or serving a warrant of arrest. In securing the premises to be searched, the member may seek out all persons on the premises and bring them to a central location for observation during the search.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Members of the media will not be allowed to enter private property without the consent of the property owner or individual in charge of the involved property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limitations of Warrants (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of searches pursuant to search warrants is limited to the premises specified in the warrant and only for those items specified in the warrant to be seized.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The search must be terminated once all items specified in the warrant are discovered.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If during execution of a warrant, there is inadvertent discovery of evidence not specified in the warrant (even when the evidence is of an unrelated crime), it may be seized under the plain view exception.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the warrant(s) authorize the search of a named person(s), a search warrant for a residence or other premises does not permit a search of all the persons present during the time of the search. If there is probable cause to believe that persons on the premises are carrying or concealing items which reasonably could be the objects of the search warrant, those persons may be detained and searched to the extent necessary to determine whether they are concealing items covered by the warrant.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;A member may remain on the premises in a search warrant only during the time reasonably necessary to conduct the search for the property described in the warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Post Execution Responsibilities (652.00)</strong></p>
<p>Upon execution of the search warrant, the member will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Leave a copy of the warrant and property receipt(s) specifying, in detail, the property taken. This copy will be left with the person from whom the property was taken, or in whose possession the property is found. In the absence of any person, the copy of the warrant/receipt(s) will be left in the place where the property was found.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Secure the location if the owner or other responsible party is unavailable.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;File all affidavits, search warrants and returns, regardless of any associated cases, with the Circuit Court issuing judge. Members will file the search warrant return and receipts as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than five days, after the execution or expiration of the warrant.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Following execution of a search warrant which involves the distribution or manufacture of controlled substances, prostitution and/or gambling, members will complete a Drugs and Vice Division (DVD) Completed Activity Report and forward the form to DVD. The information may be used to take action against the property owner under the specified crime property ordinance.</p>

<li>Frisk: A cursory pat-down type physical search of a person.</li>
<li>Inventory: A mandated examination of a person or personal property, subsequent to arrest or seizure, for purposes of safety and documentation.</li>
<li>Search: When a person&rsquo;s privacy interests are invaded. Unaided observation from a lawful vantage point is not a search in Oregon.</li>
<li>Seizure of property: When there is a significant interference with a person&rsquo;s possession or ownership interests in the property.</li>
<li>Strip search: A thorough search wherein the detainee&rsquo;s clothing is removed or rearranged so as to expose genitals, buttocks or breasts (when female).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probable Cause:</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;With certain exceptions (i.e., consent search, emergency aid, incident to arrest, parole/probation searches, and protective sweeps), most types of searches require probable cause to be valid. In general, probable cause to search means a substantial objective basis to believe that more likely than not:</p>
<p>1.1.1.&nbsp; A criminal offense is being, or has been committed.</p>
<p>1.1.2.&nbsp; Items of evidence pertaining to that criminal offense are in a specific place sought to be searched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Search Warrants and Exceptions:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a general rule, searches require a search warrant (see Directive 652.00). There are exceptions to this general rule, wherein a search warrant is not required as a prerequisite to conducting a search (i.e., administrative, automobile exception, community caretaking, consent, emergency aid, exigent circumstances, hot pursuit, incident to arrest, parole/probation searches, protective sweeps, and stop &amp; frisk). In order to search without a warrant, members must comply with the requirements for an exception as currently set down by the courts.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are subject to seizure:</p>
<p>2.2.1.&nbsp; Evidence of or information concerning the commission of a criminal of&shy;fense.</p>
<p>2.2.2.&nbsp; Contraband, the fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally pos&shy;sessed.</p>
<p>2.2.3.&nbsp; Property that has been used, or is possessed for the purpose of being used, to commit or conceal the commission of an offense.</p>
<p>2.2.4.&nbsp; A person for whose arrest there is probable cause or who is unlawfully held in concealment (i.e., children held in violation of a custody order and held in concealment from the court).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp; As this area of law is constantly changing, it is all members&rsquo; responsibility to remain aware of current law (via Tips and Techniques, in-service training, etc.).</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp; Generally, searches and inventories of a detainee may be conducted by a member of the opposite gender from that of the detainee. When safety and other tactical considerations permit, in the judgment of the member(s) at the scene, the Bureau recommends that a member of the same gender as the detainee conduct the search.</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp; When a strip search is conducted, the search will be done by a member of the same gender as that of the detainee. A second member, preferably of the same gender as the detainee, will monitor the search (for safety and witnessing).</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp; A probing search into the vagina or anus of a detainee will not be done except under the authority of a search warrant and will only be performed by medical personnel at a medical facility.</p>
<p>3.5.&nbsp; Members should document all searches in their notebook or an appropri&shy;ate report. This documentation should include reasons for, nature of and results of the search.</p>
<p>3.6.&nbsp; Unreasonable searches can result in discipline, suppression of evidence in criminal court or an award of damages in civil court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicles: Every vehicle towed (except private request tows) will be inventoried (City Code 14.10). A Property Receipt must be completed accounting for all items seized. If the vehicle&rsquo;s owner or custodian is not available, a copy of the Property Receipt will be placed in a conspicuous place in the vehicle or given to the tow operator. When a vehicle is part of a felony crime scene, or known (or suspected) to contain evidence of a felony, members should consult with an investigative sergeant prior to towing the vehicle.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detainees&rsquo; Personal Property: Per City Code 14.10, members will inventory all property of detainees.</p>
<p>4.2.1.&nbsp; Prior to detention in a secure facility (i.e., police vehicle) or transport, members will remove all toxic, flammable, or explosive substances; contraband; articles or potential articles of escape; weapons and objects that are potential weapons.</p>
<p>4.2.2.&nbsp; Once a detainee is accepted at a detention facility (i.e., MCDC), members will handle the detainee&rsquo;s personal property in accordance with the detention facility&rsquo;s policies and DIR 660.10 (i.e., placed in MCDC with the detainee, placed in the Property Room as evidence or safekeeping).</p>
<p>4.2.3.&nbsp; Large items of personal property (i.e., backpacks) are not accepted by MCDC. Members will issue a Property Receipt for such items, and place those items in the Property Room. This property inventory is mandatory. Inadvertent discovery of evidence of a crime does not preclude charging the detainee with the discovered crime.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/529164

<p><strong>POLICY (640.95)</strong></p>
<p>Undercover operations, investigations and missions are inherently dangerous. The use of sworn members in a covert role in an investigation will be limited to those instances where the use of other investigative tools (i.e., Confidential Reliable Informants (CRI), surveillance, and citizen information) is not practical or would compromise the integrity of the investigation. The overriding concern in any undercover operation is for the safety of the undercover member. A sergeant or above will supervise all undercover operations. It is essential that adequate cover officers are present during any undercover operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.95)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definition</strong></p>
<p>Undercover member: A sworn member who is working in plainclothes and in a covert manner with the goal of making personal contact with another person in a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member Responsibilities (640.95)</strong></p>
<p>An undercover member may work alone or with any number of undercover members. The undercover member should ensure that he/she does not have any items of clothing, equipment or any other item visible that would readily identify him/her as a sworn member. When in a covert role, the member is subject to the following:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time will an officer consume controlled substances as a part of the undercover role. If a situation arises where the undercover member is being forced to use controlled substances, he/she should refuse. If the suspect persists, the member(s) will extract his/herself from the situation and terminate contact.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;A member working in an undercover role should be armed. If there is a specific reason the member cannot be armed, approval from the RU manager (or designee) will be obtained before the member works unarmed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Members should avoid drinking alcohol when working undercover. In such situations and whenever possible, members will consume non-alcoholic beverages. If the need arises, a member may drink alcohol but should refrain from drinking in excess. Immediately after the operation the member will report to his/her supervisor that alcohol was consumed. In the event a member consumed alcohol, he/she will take no police action after consuming alcohol and the member will remain at his/her RU until the effects of the alcohol are gone.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Members should attempt to use audio recording devices while working undercover. If this is not practical or there is a legal reason for not recording, the member will seek supervisory approval prior to the commencement of the operation (DVD is available to assist with listening devices). Members working undercover in a prostitution mission will use audio recording devices during the entire mission, but only record those persons whom they have probable cause to believe are about to commit the crime of prostitution.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;An undercover member will not engage in sexual contact. A member will not expose his/her genitals or commit criminal offenses, to convince others that he/she is not associated with law enforcement. A sworn member in a decoy role will not expose his/her private body parts, which includes female breasts, or touch the private body parts, which includes female breasts, of a john/prostitute. A sworn member in a decoy role will document in his/her report any unsolicited touching of the member&rsquo;s private body parts by a john/prostitute. A sworn member will immediately disengage from any unsolicited touching by a john/prostitute and comment in his/her report how that was accomplished.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; An undercover member will not commit criminal offenses for the purpose of disguising that he/she is a police officer. A controlled delivery of illegal drugs with the purpose of arresting the suspect and recovering the illegal drugs and/or the display of illegal drugs to a suspect to further an investigation are not criminal offenses.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;A member working in an undercover role will not be the case officer for the investigation. The case officer, along with the supervisor, will be responsible for coordination of the operation. The undercover member&rsquo;s primary responsibility is to act in the covert role.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;The undercover member should not become involved in an arrest while acting in a covert capacity. If a situation arises that an undercover member must take police action, he/she should extract him/herself as soon as cover members arrive and take control.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For safety reasons, an undercover member should avoid entering a suspect&rsquo;s vehicle. If it is necessary to get into a suspect&rsquo;s vehicle, resources will be in position to prevent the suspect from moving the vehicle from the operational area. Contingency plans to rescue the undercover member will be included in the operational plan. &nbsp;In a prostitution mission, the undercover member is never allowed to get in the suspect vehicle.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supervisors should consider using the Air Support Unit in undercover operations to assist with the safety of the undercover member.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is more than one suspect in a case, consideration should be given to having more than one undercover member. Member safety should be the driving factor in determining how many undercover members to use.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a CRI is used to introduce an undercover member to a suspect, the case officer, undercover member and the CRI will coordinate the covert role play. The CRI will be given detailed instructions to ensure the safety of the undercover member. The CRI and the undercover member should rehearse his/her roles so that there is no confusion when the covert operation commences. Care should be given to avoid giving the CRI confidential information regarding the undercover member, the suspect or the case.</p>
<p>m. Communications must be clear and concise between the undercover member and cover members during covert operations. Visual and audio signals will be included in the operational plan, as well as telephones, radios and pagers. Pager codes and signals should be worked out ahead of time so that the cover team can communicate on multiple levels with the undercover member. Predetermined signals will be established and briefed prior to the mission so that everyone involved in the operation is cognizant of the signals.</p>
<p>n.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any member, regardless of rank, can terminate an undercover operation if he/she sees or hears something that compromises the safety of any member involved in an undercover operation.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;No probationary officer will work in an undercover capacity unless approved by the Training Division and appropriate Branch chief. Exceptions should be under exceptional circumstances and be vital to the completion of a specific case.</p>
<p>p. &nbsp;For safety reasons an undercover officer will perform their undercover duties in a public place or a public business and will not enter a residence to perform undercover operations because of the dangers entering a location controlled by a subject of an investigation. An RU manager can approve an undercover officer to enter a residence only if a full review of all safety concerns are completed and weighed to ensure the safety of the officer and strict safety conditions are imposed on the undercover operation (i.e., mandatory body-wire worn by the undercover officer and a mandatory five person extraction team is available on site to rescue the undercover officer as needed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors Responsibilities (640.95)</strong></p>
<p>Supervisors will ensure that the undercover operation is thoroughly planned and that the safety of the undercover member is the primary focus during the planning process. When conducting undercover operations supervisors should consider the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;All undercover operations will have a written operational plan that is approved by a sergeant or above.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Supervisors will ensure that there is appropriate cover present for any undercover operation. All surveillance and cover officers will be present for the operational briefing prior to the planned operation.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Communications will be outlined in the operational plan and will include: radio nets, telephone links, and visual/audio signals for the undercover member. This information will be included during the pre-operation briefing.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contingency plans for rescuing the undercover member will be included in the written operational plan and this information will be included in the pre-operation briefing.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The unit supervisor conducting the operation should notify a supervisor in the precinct/jurisdiction of an undercover operation. When practical, uniform members working in the area should be notified of the undercover operation. The notification should include a description of the undercover member and the clothes he/she is wearing.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the undercover member is going to be unarmed, the supervisor must seek RU manager&rsquo;s approval before the operation commences.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some undercover situations, it may be necessary for members to consume alcoholic beverages. In the event alcoholic beverages are consumed, members will not consume an amount which would impair to any degree their ability to perform their duty. In the event a member consumes alcohol, the supervisor will modify the member&rsquo;s duty status in the event that the member is impaired by alcohol to any perceptible degree. The evaluation will be based on specific, concurrent, articulable observations made by a trained supervisor concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the member in order to ensure that he/she takes no police action while under the influence of alcohol and that reporting requirements are adhered to. Additionally, supervisors are responsible to see members do not drive a vehicle while still under the effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the undercover member is not wearing audio recording equipment, the supervisor will ensure that the operation occurs in a public area with good visibility.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor will confirm that the Electronic Listening Device report form is completed and delivered to the District Attorney&rsquo;s office within 30 days of the recording of the verbal conversation as required by ORS 165.542 unless prior judicial authorization to record a verbal conversation(s) has been granted.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undercover members should be encouraged to voice his/her level of comfort when asked to work in a covert capacity. At no time will a supervisor assign a member to work in a covert role if the member is uncomfortable with the operation plan or his/her ability to perform in a covert role.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor will coordinate with the Air Support Unit when using an airplane during undercover operations.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No undercover operation will be executed until the Oregon State Intelligence Network (OSIN) has been notified and the operation has been de-conflicted. It will be the supervisor&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure this occurs prior to the operation.</p>
<p>m. All undercover operations will be debriefed as soon as practical.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;Supervisors should complete the training in the use of the recording equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RU Manager Responsibilities (640.95)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;RU manager will ensure that supervisors are responsible for planning undercover operations and that the safety of the undercover member is a primary concern.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Managers will determine when it is appropriate for a member to work in an undercover role without a firearm.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;RU manager will ensure that the precinct has the proper audio equipment (body wire) devices available for the undercover mission.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;RU manager will ensure that all recording equipment will be purchased from the recommended list obtained through the DVD technicians.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;RU manager will ensure that all recording equipment will be maintained by each division.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;RU manager will ensure that all officers and supervisors involved in the use of the recording equipment have been trained by DVD technicians in the proper use of the equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DVD Responsibilities (640.95)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (640.90)</strong></p>
<p>It is an obligation for each sworn member of this Bureau to actively enforce City, State or Federal laws, whether in overt (i.e., in uniform) or covert (i.e., plainclothes or disguised and/or role playing) capacity, and as lawfully directed by a supervisor. Therefore, each member shall fulfill that obligation according to enforcement needs and with consideration of individual qualifications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.90)</strong></p>
<p>It is more desirable to assign volunteer members to covert missions. However, dependent upon a variety of circumstances, including the size of a mission, and the hours and tactics of the operation, an adequate number of volunteer members may not be available. Therefore, the following procedures for selection of members to perform these duties will be used:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the mission is initiated within a relief, members of that relief will be polled for voluntary assignment.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, for any reason, an insufficient number of qualified members volunteer to satisfy needs to ensure the success of the mission, other reliefs within the Precinct be polled for volunteers.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;If an insufficient number of members is attained through the voluntary process for a mission which is restricted to the relief level or for a mission which is expanded to the Precinct level, members may be ordered to perform in the function. Precinct and/or relief commanders may order individuals to serve as necessary. In order to ensure fairness in the distribution of involuntary assignments, and depending on the size, scope and specific needs of the missions, supervisors will attempt to rotate these assignments among qualified members of their command. Except under unusual circumstances, and unless the assignment is voluntary, no member shall serve in the covert assignment for longer than five (5) consecutive days during one (1) mission.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exigent circumstances may require the immediate assignment of members without an opportunity to request volunteers.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;If a mission is to be conducted jointly by two or more precincts, the same principles of assignment cited above shall apply.</p>
<p>Contractual obligations under the City and appropriate bargaining unit agreement(s) shall apply.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/529146

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member Responsibilities (640.80)</strong></p>
<p>Members responding to criminal offenses need to be aware of the criteria used to determine whether a criminal act falls within the mandatory bias/prejudice crime reporting requirements. The following information will assist members in making such determinations:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The motivation of the perpetrator, as expressed in statements made to the victim or to the member, (i.e., slurs, epithets).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The belief of the victim that the intent of the act was based on bias or prejudice.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The nature of the symbols used to deface public or private property indicate bias or prejudice.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;The date and time of the occurrence corresponds to a holiday of significance.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Observations made by the member and the common sense review of the &nbsp;circumstances surrounding the incident which indicate bias or prejudice. Such observations may include the group or groups involved, the manner and means of the crime committed, and recurring patterns of similar incidents in the same area or against the same victim.</p>
<p>Members responding to crime scenes determined to be motivated by bias or prejudice will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Ensure that victims are handled in a sensitive and caring fashion.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Place the notation Bias Crime across the top of the Investigation Report.</p>

<p><strong>Precinct Commanders (640.80)</strong></p>
<p>Precinct commanders becoming aware of a hate crime will ensure that the following individuals receive a copy of the report on the next workday. When those cases involved a felony, the same individuals will be personally notified by the precinct commander:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The Chief of Police.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The Operations Branch chief.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The Public Information Officer.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Detectives Bias Crime Unit.</p>
<p>In cases involving felonies or in cases where the victim would benefit, the precinct commander will ensure that community leaders of the negatively impacted group are briefed on the situation and encouraged to provide support to the victim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Records Division (Records) (640.80)</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of each month, Records will forward a letter of transmittal and copies of the previous month&rsquo;s bias/prejudice reports to LEDS for their review. LEDS will determine if the incident is a bias/prejudice crime for Oregon Uniform Crime Reporting (OUCR) purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL (640.80)</strong></p>
<p>Supervisors will ensure all members have the ability to identify bias crimes, and ensure members are aware of the investigation and reporting requirements.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (640.75)</strong></p>
<p>The polygraph (i.e., lie detector) is a valuable investigative tool that may be used in conjunction with, but not as a substitute for, a thorough investigation. The polygraph may be employed to verify, corroborate or refute statements, and narrow or focus investigative leads. The polygraph can assist in verifying and/or eliminating possible suspects and, in some situations, enhances the credibility of victims, witnesses, and informants.</p>
<p>A successful polygraph examination is dependent on a thorough investigation being conducted prior to the exam. Failure to do so may invalidate the results.</p>
<p>The polygrapher conducting the examination must be licensed by the State of Oregon as provided in ORS or under similar regulations in other states or federal jurisdictions. The polygraph is the only instrument for detection of deception that is authorized for use in criminal investigations and, therefore, will be the only instrument used by the Portland Police Bureau for such a purpose. Use of any other instrument purporting to be a detection of deception device is forbidden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.75)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Exam or examination: The polygraph examination.</p>
<p>Polygrapher: A licensed operator of a polygraph.</p>
<p>Proficiency: A person skilled in the English language to understand, and be understood by other English speakers.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;For suppression hearings.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;For prison discipline hearings.</p>
<p>Confessions and incriminating statements obtained during these examinations may be admissible in court. The polygraph will not be used for the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Probable cause, arrest, prosecution, or withholding of property.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Employment purposes.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;On employees who are the subject of an internal or criminal investigation.</p>

<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.60)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definition</strong></p>
<p>Dying declaration: &ldquo;A statement made by a declarant while believing that death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what the declarant believed to be impending death&rdquo; (Oregon Evidence Code &ndash; Rule 804(3)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member Responsibilities (640.60)</strong></p>
<p>It must appear that the person making a dying declaration is aware of their impending death. This need not necessarily appear from an expressed statement, but may be inferred from signs, nods, pressure of the hand, or pointing to visible persons or objects in answering leading questions.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, a dying declaration should be taken from a victim when it is evident that the injured person may die. A dying declaration, if at all possible, should be reduced to writing, signed by the person making the declaration, and duly witnessed.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;When there is neither time nor opportunity to reduce the statement to writing, the words used are admissible as evidence. If the member receiving them cannot remember the exact language, the member should state the substance, but it must be sufficiently clear and definite to indicate precisely the meaning and intent of the person making the statement.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The statement, or substance of the statement, should be recorded in the member&rsquo;s notebook.</p>
<p>A member taking a dying declaration should first ask the injured person, in the presence of witnesses, if the person believes that they are about to die. After the injured person has answered this question in the affirmative, the member should proceed with the statement in the presence of witnesses. When the member-in-charge of the scene of a crime, or in a hospital, is informed by a licensed physician that the criminally injured person cannot recover, the member will immediately notify a supervisor and the Detective Division (Detectives).</p>
<p>Detectives will dispatch a member of their division, if one is not already present, to take the statement of the dying person. In the event the condition of the injured person does not permit waiting for a supervisor or detective, the member who is present and in charge, will proceed at once to obtain a dying declaration in the presence of witnesses. The dying declaration may be tape recorded if the dying person is specifically informed according to ORS 165.540. Example:</p>
<p>I, __________________, believing that I am about to die and having absolutely no hope of recovering, do hereby solemnly declare that __________________&nbsp;(name of accused), did on or about the_____&nbsp;day of _______________&nbsp;A.D., 200__, in the City of __________________, County of __________________, (here give the detail if injuries inflicted, or if a poisoning, state the detail as fully as possible).</p>
<p>I hereby declare that the above statement is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and that it is made by me under the fixed belief that I am about to die and I look to death as inevitable and at hand.</p>

<li>City Code 3.58.060&nbsp; Fleet Accident Review Boards</li>
<li>DIR 341.00&nbsp; Discipline Process</li>
<li>DIR 630.05 Vehicle Pursuits</li>
<li>DIR 640.50 Traffic Crash Investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (640.52)</strong></p>
<p>Collisions involving Bureau assigned vehicles will be investigated and reviewed by a panel of peers. This function will be carried out by the Collision Review Board (CRB) which meets the requirements of the City for a Fleet Accident Review Board (FARB).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.52)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Collision Review Board</strong></p>
<p>The CRB will consist of ten members, including the Loss Control manager who will serve as the chairperson. The remainder of the CRB will be comprised of representatives from the following divisions: Traffic, Training, Detectives, Fleet and five representatives from precinct operations. It is not mandatory that each RU be represented individually. The RU manager of an outgoing board member will determine his/her replacement.</p>
<p>The CRB will meet monthly at a regularly set time and location. A minimum of five CRB members must be present to conduct a meeting. All collisions and damage involving Bureau assigned vehicles with another vehicle, object, or person will be reviewed, except collisions resulting from the use of techniques as defined by DIR 630.05.</p>
<p>The CRB serves two main functions in the review of Bureau vehicle collisions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Ensure that investigations and documentation are complete.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Make a recommendation for finding on all cases reviewed and submit the recommendation to the appropriate RU manager for consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Collision Review Process (640.52)</strong></p>
<p>Copies of all reports that are generated from a vehicle collision investigation are to be sent through channels to Police Liability Management (PLM). These include, but are not limited to, accident reports, Special Reports, After Action Reports and City Traffic Accident Reports. Files will be established for each case and copies distributed to the CRB for their review. If these documents are not received in their entirety, the CRB may elect to send the case back for further investigation prior to hearing the case.</p>
<p>The CRB will consider only the facts and circumstances of each individual case. A member&rsquo;s past driving history will have no bearing on the recommendation given.</p>
<p>PLM will notify members of the date, time and location of the CRB meeting that will be reviewing their case. Members will have an opportunity to attend the meeting when their case is reviewed. If the members wish to attend the CRB meeting, and are unable to do so, arrangements can be made with PLM to have the case rescheduled to the following month. Members attending a CRB meeting will be given an opportunity to speak concerning the circumstances of the collision and may be asked questions by the CRB to assist in their understanding of the incident.</p>
<p>Upon completion of each case, the CRB will make a recommendation for finding to the member&rsquo;s RU manager. The recommendation for finding, along with the investigation completed by the member&rsquo;s supervisor, will assist in the final determination. If the CRB finds that an investigation is incomplete, the case may be sent back to the investigating supervisor for follow up.</p>
<p>The CRB&rsquo;s recommendation for finding will be based on criteria established by the National Traffic Safety Council (i.e., did the driver do everything reasonable to avoid the collision?). Recommendation categories include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Preventable &ndash; (i.e., the driver failed to recognize a hazardous condition or circumstance and failed to take appropriate action to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid a collision.).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Non-preventable &ndash; (i.e., the driver did recognize a hazardous condition or circumstances and took appropriate action to maintain control of the vehicle and avoid a collision.).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not an Accident &ndash; (i.e., when a collision and investigation had been initiated and concluded that there was a deliberate action taken by a driver that resulted in damage or injury, or that a non-deliberate action had occurred, but it was later determined that there was no damage and no injury.).</p>
<p>Members are often required to drive under circumstances that are unusual and at times extreme. The determination of preventable/non-preventable by the CRB must be tempered by the nature and significance of the mission at hand.</p>
<p>Members will not be notified at the time of the meeting of the CRB&rsquo;s recommendation for finding. The RU manager will give notice to the member of the final determination.</p>
<p>Should the recommendation of the CRB be in conflict with initial supervisory recommendations, the CRB will submit an additional memorandum to the RU manager explaining the CRB&rsquo;s rationale.</p>
<p>If an RU manager finds a case to be preventable, he/she will make a recommendation, including discipline, to the Branch chief. It is the responsibility of the RU manager to notify PLM of their recommended discipline and when the discipline has been completed, as PLM maintains the driver history information for Bureau members.</p>
<p>Should the RU manager&rsquo;s final decision be in conflict with the recommendation of the CRB, a memorandum will be submitted by the RU manager to his/her Branch chief, with a copy to the CRB, explaining his/her decision.</p>
<p>The CRB will not make a recommendation for specific discipline and will not track this process. However, since the ultimate outcome of collision investigations is possible disciplinary action, Bureau policies for disciplinary action will be followed.</p>
<p>The CRB will produce an annual report for RU managers and, when necessary, identify factors that may lead to improved training and education. The CRB will produce a monthly summation of the recommendations for finding given at each meeting.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/529105

<p><strong>POLICY (640.35)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau will investigate all allegations of abuse to elderly persons (any person 65 years or older) and persons with disabilities (persons who are at risk of abuse, neglect or exploitation due to their mental or physical disability). Each investigation will be completed with a written report of the findings. The Bureau will work with appropriate agencies and resources to help lower the incidence of abuse.</p>
<p>Abuse will include the following for use in this directive:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any physical injury caused by other than accidental means, or which appears to be at variance with the explanation given of the injury.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neglect, or the failure to provide basic care, such as necessary goods or services, resulting in physical harm, unreasonable discomfort, or serious loss of human dignity.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Failure to provide direct patient care, (i.e., abandonment, desertion, or willful forsaking of an elderly person or the withdrawal or neglect of duties and obligations owed a dependent adult by a caretaker or other person).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Sexual or verbal abuse, or involuntary seclusion.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Financial exploitation or the illegal or improper use of another individual&rsquo;s resources for personal profit or gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.35)</strong></p>
<p>Within two hours of the receipt of a report alleging abuse to a person in a long-term care facility or nursing home, a uniform member shall be sent to investigate. The investigating member must actually go to the facility or setting to determine the nature and cause of abuse to the patient(s). A person from Aging and Disabilities Services (ADS) is available to make an on-site visit with the member to provide intervention services as needed. The phone number is available under the Gatekeeper Program in the Problem Solving Resource Guide. Abuse in settings other than nursing facilities will be responded to in accordance to the immediacy of the situation.</p>
<p>If the abuse appears not to be of a criminal nature, the responding member will report the situation to ADS at the 24-hour number. As the mandated social services agency in MultnomahCounty, ADS will make a visit to conduct protective services investigations and intervention. If evidence of criminal activity is subsequently discovered, an Adult Protective Service (a program within ADS) worker will contact a uniform member for assistance.</p>
<p>The elder or person with disability may be photographed for the purposes of preserving evidence of the condition of the patient at the time of the investigation.</p>
<p>As defined by case law, reasonable cause is a reasonable ground for belief in guilt. For the purposes of this directive, the term will be considered the same as probable cause. If the investigation shows reasonable cause to believe that abuse has occurred, the investigating member will complete an Investigation Report and immediately notify ADS for follow-up services. The Elder Crime Response Team (ECRT) will send a copy of all reports relating to abused patients to ADS.</p>
<p>When a member believes it is necessary to remove an elder or person with disability from a long-term care facility, or other setting, due to abuse or neglect, and the person is agreeable, or, if unable to communicate, and a member determines that their present setting presents a risk to their health and safety, all efforts should be made to place them with a friend or relative. When this is not possible, call the ADS Help-line to provide information on an available placement location. In each of these cases, an Investigation Report will be completed and ADS will be indicated in the distribution box.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will a call regarding elder abuse be given a coded disposition indicating no report was written. A Special or Investigation Report must be written detailing the member&rsquo;s actions and documenting that ADS was either notified by telephone or forwarded a copy of the report.</p>
<p>All reports and evidence gathered under this order will be marked Confidential by the investigating member. The report and any pertinent supporting information may be shared with ADS protective service workers conducting elder and disability abuse investigations. All reports and documents gathered by ADS will be available to the investigating member.</p>
<p>ECRT sergeant will be responsible for case assignment for follow-up investigations.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526298

<li>Custodial Interference<strong>: </strong>Where a person, knowing or having reason to believe that they have no legal right to do so, takes, entices or keeps an individual from another person&rsquo;s lawful custody, or violates a valid joint custody order from a court, with the intent to hold the individual permanently or for a protracted period.<strong><em></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that members will investigate family disputes regarding minors and other dependent individuals under parentship/guardianship. Members shall investigate custodial interference situations in accordance with the procedures in this directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Bureau recognizes that some custodial interference may have civil or criminal implications.&nbsp; If a member determines that the custodial interference does not rise to the level of criminal conduct and instead warrants civil resolution, members shall not intercede in physical custody disputes, but will instead refer involved parents/guardians to the Family Courts for resolution.&nbsp; For custodial interferences rising to the level of criminal conduct, members will follow the procedures set forth in this directive.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of any indications of a criminal act, concerns about the child&rsquo;s welfare, or a signed order from a judge commanding law enforcement to transfer custody of a child, members shall not transfer physical custody from one party to another.&nbsp; Members shall instead refer both parties to Family Court for resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a member takes a report involving custodial interference, and any involved child is believed to be in imminent danger by being with the suspect(s), the member shall immediately contact a supervisor and advise of the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The supervisor will then contact a Missing Persons Unit (MPERS) detective or the On-Call Homicide Supervisor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPERS detective or the On-Call Homicide supervisor (or a designee), will evaluate whether the incident meets the criteria for an Amber Alert. &nbsp;Members shall refer to Directive 850.39, Missing, Runaway, Lost, or Disoriented Persons, for additional guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any person requesting from a member a recommendation for an attorney should be referred to the Oregon State Bar Lawyers Referral Service or the Multnomah County Family Law Court. Members shall not recommend attorneys or provide legal advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Reporting:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members taking reports that appear to constitute custodial interference that is determined to be criminal in nature shall complete a General Offense Report. The report should include detailed biographical and contact information for all involved parties, including the reporting party, alleged suspects, and alleged missing or involved child.&nbsp; If a member determines that the matter is not criminal in nature, the member may document that determination in the comments on the member&rsquo;s mobile data computer (MDC) prior to closing the call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members taking reports that appear to constitute custodial interference shall ensure the report is routed to the MPERS Detective Division through the Regional Justice Information Network (RegJIN). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions regarding criminal custodial interference should be referred to MPERS during business hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members encountering custodial interference cases that appear to involve child abuse or sexual abuse will also contact the Child Abuse Team.&nbsp; Members shall refer to Directive 640.30, Child Abuse Investigations and 850.39, Missing, Runaway, Lost, or Disoriented Persons, for additional guidance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should clearly articulate the reporting party&rsquo;s reason(s) for why the incident might rise to the level of criminal custodial interference, rather than possibly being a civil custody matter to be remedied in the appropriate Family Law Court.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; Unusual circumstances which might indicate that immediate detective follow-up is needed.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a patrol supervisor feels an investigation needs detective assistance, a Detective supervisor should be contacted to determine if a detective is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Detectives Responsibilities (640.10)</strong></p>
<p>Detectives assigned to the crime scene will:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Assume command of the investigation upon their arrival. They will be responsible only to their own supervisors and will contact an on-duty sergeant or relief commander, if it is necessary for uniform members to stay at the scene and assist.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascertain from uniformed members how far the investigation has progressed in order to avoid duplication of effort.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Obtain a detailed description of suspects and property for broadcast by BOEC.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau recognizes there is a need to photographically document crime scenes and injuries to victims/suspects to facilitate the investigative process. There are also times in which audio and video recordings are needed to fully document a crime scene or investigation. These digital recordings are evidence in these cases and should be treated as such. This policy does not cover non-evidentiary photographs or non-evidentiary digital evidence such as training or PR events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.02)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Digital Evidence: Information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in binary form.</p>
<p>Digital imaging: The recording of an image via digital code, which is viewable&nbsp;using a corresponding computer software application.</p>
<p>DIMS: Digital Image Management System used for the electronic storage of digital image data from either photographic or video evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Photographing Crime Scenes (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>A Forensic Evidence Division (FED) Criminalist will have the sole responsibility of photographing evidence at major crime scenes such as homicides, member involved shootings, fatal traffic collisions, questionable or suspicious deaths and autopsies. These photographs will be captured using digital SLR cameras. FED photographs will be taken in the RAW format when documenting items that may need later forensic analysis and comparison. All other photos may be taken in the format in which the least amount of compression is used.</p>
<p>In any other case where photographs/images may benefit the investigation, members may use a bureau issued digital camera or bureau issued cell phone with camera capabilities to document the scene or evidence. Members will not use personal cameras and/or media unless in an emergency situation and no bureau cameras are available. When a personal camera is used, the image will be downloaded to the DIMS system. When a personal camera is used there is no provision for selecting some of the images to transmit and not others. Any images, audio, or video files on a media card, whether bureau issued or personal, will be downloaded into DIMS and erased at the conclusion of the download session. All images recorded on a media will be in the format in which the least amount of compression is used. Images will not be altered in any way.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the member taking the photographs to download the images to the DIMS system using a download station. All images, regardless of quality, value or appropriateness to the investigation, will be transferred unaltered directly into DIMS.</p>
<p>Once the digital images have been successfully downloaded to DIMS, the DIMS program will be used to erase the images from the media card.</p>
<p>Members will not use the delete image(s) function of the camera to erase photographs.</p>
<p>Members will not attach or embed any copies of images to original police reports.</p>
<p>Members may record more than one crime scene or event on a memory card provided that steps are taken to ensure images are not misidentified, overwritten or assigned to the wrong case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Digital Audio and Video Recordings (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>Members recording digital audio or video for investigative purposes shall store the evidence in accordance with their specific RU&rsquo;s SOPs. If no SOP or RU database exists, then digital audio and video recordings shall be downloaded and stored in the DIMS system.</p>
<p>Digital evidence (audio, video, or still images) seized in the course of an investigation may be sent to FED for downloading into the DIMS system if necessary for investigatory purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirements for Digital Cameras (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>Forensics is responsible for providing the following minimum specifications and requirements for digital imaging:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Digital camera requirements:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Minimum 5 mega pixels (minimum 3 mega pixel for camera phones)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; External memory card for image storage</p>
<p>Because the digital market changes rapidly, it is suggested that any RU researching the purchase of digital cameras contact the Forensics Photo Lab personnel for the latest recommendations and considerations for quality compact camera systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DIMS Viewing Capabilities (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>All members will have the capability to view/review their own photographs of cases they photographed. Members with investigative needs and certain supervisory staff may have additional access to cases depending on permission sets granted. DIMS will keep an audit trail of all photographs recording the date, time, and person accessing each digital image file. Members shall not view images except for bureau authorized purposes. Downloading an evidentiary image to save to another medium is not authorized, except as provided for by FED image processing SOPs. Members may print photographs for investigative purposes as needed. Any images needed for court purposes will be requested from Forensics using the online print ordering module.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Forensic Evidence Division (Forensics) Responsibilities (640.02)</strong></p>
<p>It is the responsibility of FED to print or reproduce images and photographs of crime scenes, victim&rsquo;s injuries, and other investigative photographs/images. All evidentiary photographic images will be downloaded and stored in the DIMS system. All archived images will be retained in accordance with Bureau archive protocols, city and state requirements, and federal guidelines. Any disruptions in DIMS service shall be reported to FED. An FED/DIMS administrator will coordinate with the DIMS vendor to restore service.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526249

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (640.01)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau recognizes the importance of having current photographic identification on individuals involved in police actions. Although the Forensic Evidence Division (Forensics) maintains or has access to photo files and provides necessary services, there may be an investigative need for copies of Oregon driver&rsquo;s license or identification (I.D.) card photographs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.01)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;When a photograph (mug shot) or image of a subject is not available through Forensics or the current division photograph does not reflect the current appearance of the subject, requests for an Oregon driver&rsquo;s license or I.D. card photograph will be made using WebLEDS.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;To make requests, members will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Use the LEDS DPL mask.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Enter the Oregon driver&rsquo;s license or I.D. card number of the subject in the required field.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;DMV will electronically send the photo in their response.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526246

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (640.00)</strong></p>
<p>Only voluntarily complying adults, not under arrest, and all juveniles arrested (refer DIR 640.70), will be processed at the Forensic Evidence Division (Forensics). All other individuals requiring fingerprinting and/or photographing will be processed as described in the following procedures and under the provisions of DIR 870.30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ID Verification for Persons not Under Arrest (640.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;A voluntarily complying adult not under arrest but the subject of a police action may desire to verify his/her identity in order to avoid misidentification. In these situations, the individual may be escorted to Forensics where fingerprints and a photograph may be taken for the purpose of identity verification.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Photographs and fingerprints taken under these circumstances do not become part of the Bureau&rsquo;s permanent record, nor do they suffice for the statutory requirement of mugging and fingerprinting.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If a jailable custody arrest or citation issuance results from this action, the subject will be processed per the applicable directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ID Verification: Z-Cite or C-Cite (640.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;In situations where the identity of a person to be cited for a violation or any non-jailable offense is either unknown or in question, members will attempt to verify the identity using an IBIS fingerprint device, IWS mug system, DMV, PPDS and LEDS - CCH files.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If the IBIS system is down, or the member is unable to capture quality prints for use with IBIS, and other means of searching have not provided reasonable verification of identity members may contact Forensics to determine if unit workload demands and staffing will allow Forensics to provide an identity check.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If resources allow, members will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Transport offenders to Central Precinct and place them in a precinct holding cell.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Obtain a left and right thumb and right four finger impressions on the backside of a copy of the Custody Report.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Obtain PPDS, LEDS, CCH and NCIC identity information on the person the arrestee claims to be.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Take the inked thumb and fingerprints (on the back of the custody report) as well as any PPDS, DMV and CCH printouts to Forensics.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Identity verification can be accomplished by Forensics only if the name provided by the offender has associated prints and mugshots on file. Forensics technicians will attempt to verify only whether or not the suspect in custody is the person they claim to be.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forensics will not roll a full set of fingerprints nor make a full-file search to determine the arrested subject&rsquo;s true name.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; In exceptional circumstances, where the above noted means of identification verification have been exhausted and the situation merits further inquiry, members may contact (with supervisory approval) a Forensics supervisor and request an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) latent direct inquiry be made. The inquiry is made using the two thumb impressions on the back of the Custody Report. The Forensics supervisor, upon receipt of any available computer file printouts, will attempt to arrange for the inquiry. If a criminalist or qualified technician is unavailable, the member will be directed to leave the photocopy of the Custody Report containing the two thumb and right four finger impressions with Forensics for an AFIS direct entry as soon as feasible. Continued custody of the subject is at the discretion of the member and his/her supervisor.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is determined during the identification verification process that a Giving False Information offense has been committed, the suspect will be processed through MCDC.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Expedited Fingerprint Search (640.00)</strong></p>
<p>Warrants based on false identity information during citation issuance cause inconveniences for many individuals. When Forensics discovers incorrect information has been presented during a C-Cite arrest (or when a member needs to verify the identity of a suspect when issuing a C-Cite and the above procedure fails to provide the necessary information) members will apply the following procedures:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;In situations where a suspected serious offender&rsquo;s true identity is not known and Forensics determines an FBI file search is necessary, a MCDC Intake supervisor will be notified. An expedited search hold will be placed on the suspect and remain in effect until such time as Forensics receives information from the FBI. Requests for fingerprint processing through the FBI Expedited Fingerprint Search System will be honored only if justification satisfies the criteria established by the FBI. Furthermore, Forensic technicians are authorized to grant or deny such requests based on those criteria.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;When circumstances justify granting expedited searches, the arresting member has the responsibility of arranging for a higher bail (extraordinary bail) to ensure the suspect remains in custody until the FBI responds to the inquiry. The arresting member will obtain authorization from a Circuit Court judge for increased security deposits. A list of judges is on file in Detectives and the Drug and Vice Division (DVD).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; The words Extraordinary Bail will be written on the top of the Custody Report. For details in requesting Extraordinary Bail, see DIR 880.30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Corrected Identity &ndash; False Information Situations (640.00)</strong></p>
<p>The following procedures will apply when the identity of an arrestee, based upon FBI, SID, fingerprint, or CCH records, is determined to be different than the identity used upon arrest:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The Forensic technician will notify MCDC of the corrected identity.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;MCDC will then run a LEDS/NCIC records check and serve any warrants.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a name or date of birth was presented by the arrestee, and his/her true identity was subsequently determined based upon FBI, SID, fingerprint, or CCH records a Corrected Arrest Information &ndash; Furnishing False Information Special Report (FFI) will be completed by the Forensics technician. Copies of the report will be forwarded to the arresting member prior to the arraignment of the arrestee.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the issuing/arresting member is present at MCDC, he or she will issue a new citation charging the original crimes(s) and FFI.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; If the issuing/arresting member is not present at MCDC when the correct identity has been obtained, the following procedures will apply:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Felony and Misdemeanor Citations.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;The Forensic technician will send a copy of his/her report to the Records Division (Records).</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Records will then send a copy of the Forensic technicians report along with the arresting member&rsquo;s report to the District Attorney&rsquo;s (DA&rsquo;s) Office.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Forensic technicians will fax a copy of the FFI report to the arresting member.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;If a criminal case receives no complaint from the DA&rsquo;s Office and it is later learned a FFI crime has been committed, the member may request a warrant be issued. This is accomplished through the submission of a Special Report to the complaint signer. The complaint signer may then ask the DA&rsquo;s Office to consider issuing a warrant.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Violation Citations.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Violations: The DA&rsquo;s Office does not review traffic violation citations.</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;A copy of the Corrected Arrest Information/Special Report will be forwarded by mail or fax to the member.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Members may reissue violation citations when they deem it necessary. Members may also issue a FFI citation.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Non-Traffic Violations: The DA&rsquo;s Office reviews all non-traffic violations. The same procedures outlined above for felony and misdemeanor crimes should be followed.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526243

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (635.00)</strong></p>
<p>The only function of members at a strike scene or job action is to preserve the peace and to protect life and property. Neutrality will be the guiding principal. No bias can be displayed by either the words or actions of members. Unless otherwise ruled by a court of competent jurisdiction, workers have the right to refuse to work under conditions felt to be unfair. Workers also have the right to peaceably picket the struck establishment. An employer has the right to defend his/her work policies and salary standards. Police may be used at a strike scene or job action to enforce the law and to maintain normal traffic flow on streets and sidewalks, and normal entry and egress of the struck establishment. If information indicates the possibility of violence, a police presence when the strike begins may prove to be an effective deterrent to violence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (635.00)</strong></p>
<p>The following procedures should be followed at all strike and job action situations:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Strikes, as a normal rule, can be anticipated for some period of time prior to the actual strike. This time allows for the gathering of information to accurately determine what can be expected. Plans for any police action should be based on reasonably reliable information, not spurious claims by labor or management. The following information can be useful to police managers in determining an appropriate police response at a strike or job action:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; Name, business address and telephone number of employer and a point of contact.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; Name, address and telephone number of union, union local number and affiliation and a point of contact.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of business.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp; Number and occupation of employees involved in the dispute.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp; Reason for the dispute.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp; Date strike is declared.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp; Number and occupation of employees who will continue to work.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp; Types of problems anticipated.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp; Type of strike (sympathy, wildcat, lockout, secondary, etc.).</p>
<p>10. Location and size of the plant, number of entrances and exits, loading platforms, etc.</p>
<p>11. Other building or locations that might be affected by the strike.</p>
<p>12. Time of arrival and departure of employees who will continue to work.</p>
<p>13. Transit facilities, schedules and routes.</p>
<p>14. Meal periods for employees and whether or not they eat on the premises.</p>
<p>15. Times when merchandise is to be received or shipped.</p>
<p>16. Special hazards or other conditions, which might affect police duty.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp; Park police vehicles in an area away from strikers and leave a guard with them.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp; Prevent blockage of public streets and private driveways. Normal traffic flow should be maintained and normal entry and exit from the establishment should be allowed.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp; Prevent pickets and strikers from blocking the sidewalks.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp; Members and supervisors should not discuss the labor dispute with members of labor or management. Any conferences with police or instructions as to legal limits on behavior should include both sides of the dispute.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a strike captain has not been appointed by the union picketers, one should be named and used as the labor contact with police. Management should also appoint a single contact person to work with the police.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp; The applicable laws and ordinances should be explained to leaders of both labor and management. Both sides should be informed how the police will impartially enforce the applicable statutes. The consequences of non-cooperation should be explained clearly.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp; During the course of the strike, the collection of information should continue.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Video taping and/or still photography of the event is useful to deter illegal activity and to document evidence of crimes (bearing in mind the restrictions of ORS 181.575). The City Auditor&rsquo;s Office will determine the retention schedule of any video or photographs.</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (631.90)</strong></p>
<p>Members arriving first at the scene of a major fire will initiate prompt radio notification to their supervisor and BOEC regarding the magnitude of the fire, and will forecast as nearly as possible the need for additional police assistance.</p>
<p>Members responding to a crime scene (e.g., burglary, theft, stolen or recovered vehicle) and discovering damage from fire will notify the Fire Bureau Investigator via radio.</p>
<p>The fire investigator will determine if arson has occurred, and, if so, will be responsible for the crime report. Should a fire investigator be unavailable and the member feels that a crime has occurred, the member will complete an Investigation Report and direct a copy to the Detective Division (Detectives) Arson Detail.</p>
<p>The Fire Bureau has agreed to immediately notify Detectives when a fire of suspicious origin has resulted in death or serious physical injury to a person.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Detectives will respond to the scene at once and contact the fire investigator.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives at the scene will evaluate the need for additional detectives or support, and will contact command members for the purpose of fulfilling those needs.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives will work with the original fire investigator. When the fire investigator&rsquo;s continued assistance is needed beyond his/her tour of duty, the detectives will request through their commanding officer to the Fire Marshall&rsquo;s Office that the fire investigator be placed on special assignment pending completion of the investigation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Detectives will notify the Public Information Officer (PIO).</p>
<p>In all cases of arson, the Fire Bureau will have charge of the technical on-scene investigation with the Police Bureau being responsible for follow-up investigation. When arson causes death, the homicide detail will be responsible for the investigation. The scene of a possible arson where there is death or serious injury will be treated as a crime scene.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The news media and the public will be held back, with perimeter security handled by uniformed members, so that the scene and evidence may be protected.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If there is a death:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The body will not be moved unless it is necessary to preserve it from being consumed by fire (refer to DIR 631.10).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Detectives will ensure that the Medical Examiner has been contacted so that the body may be removed after the initial investigation.</p>
<p>Members at the scene or conducting traffic control will report any suspicious or unusual persons, vehicles, actions, etc. on a Special Report and direct it to Detectives Division.</p>
<p>News media requesting information should be referred to the PIO.</p>

<p><strong>PROCEDURE (631.85)</strong></p>
<p>Precinct commanders identifying a park and/or stadium where the permitted use of alcoholic beverages habitually leads to or creates the potential for criminal and/ or disruptive behavior should submit, through channels to the Chief of Police, a recommendation that more restrictive modifications to the city code be considered for that particular park and/or stadium. The recommendation must address preservation of the public peace and include, where applicable, documentation such as, but not limited to: neighborhood complaints, photographs showing the conditions, police reports or any other reports or analyses of the problem or a petition from neighborhood organizations or individuals.</p>
<p>Recommendations may include completely prohibiting alcoholic beverages in the park or placing increased restrictions on permits for the consumption of alcoholic beverages (i.e., number issued, size of party, specific dates, etc.).</p>
<p>Contact and discussion with the Office of the Director of the Parks Bureau will be part of the process in preparing the recommendations. Documentation of this discussion will be included in the written recommendation.</p>

<li>ORS &sect; 498.016 Taking Crippled or Helpless Wildlife</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. The purpose of this directive is to establish guidelines for the handling of animal related calls. While the Portland Police Bureau receives calls to respond to animal problems, Multnomah County Animal&nbsp;Control (MCAC) is responsible for the investigation of all complaints regarding domestic animals and the enforcement of animal related laws. Issues concerning animal cruelty or managing protective custody of prisoners&rsquo; animals should be directed to MCAC. &nbsp;For situations involving wildlife animals, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) is the managing agency and will be notified to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Member Responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; For non-emergency situations, members will refer a complaint and/or problem regarding noisy, dangerous, loose, abandoned, sick, injured, and dead animals to MCAC. &nbsp;Police units will not be dispatched for situations involving barking dogs, dog bites where the animal is presently contained, cats on a roof, strays, loose livestock, etc., unless the animal is creating a hazardous condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; In situations involving non-domestic animals (e.g., deer, raccoons, etc.), members may contact ODFW for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; In emergency situations where an aggressive animal poses a threat to public safety, members will take appropriate action to deter or prevent the animal from doing immediate harm to a person(s)<em> </em>and, when time and circumstances permit, notify MCAC or ODFW or advise the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) dispatcher to notify either agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will take appropriate action to save the life of an animal they reasonably believe is in danger (e.g., breaking a car window to extract an animal trapped in a hot car).&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may be called to respond to traffic accidents involving animals and in situations where an animal is injured or dead and is creating a traffic hazard.&nbsp; Upon arrival of MCAC, ODFW, or the Oregon Department of Transportation personnel, members should remain at the scene to assist, if requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members have the option of calling MCAC to take a prisoner&rsquo;s animal into protective custody at the scene or impounding the animal and transporting it to the Central Precinct animal holding cage in accordance with Directive 870.40, Prisoners&rsquo; Animals.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In situations where MCAC is requested to take a prisoner&rsquo;s animal into protective custody at the scene, members should request from a prisoner a name and contact information for someone who can pick up the animal if they are unable to.&nbsp; Members will then ensure that MCAC personnel are provided with the name and address of either the owner or the party designated by the owner for subsequent retrieval of the animal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not contact privately contracted animal retrieval companies directly. These companies provide after-hour response under contract with MCAC. &nbsp;However, members may refer individual pet owners to MCAC or these companies (if known) for services at the individual&rsquo;s own expense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Response to Vicious or Aggressive or Badly Injured Animals.</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, governs all uses of force, including force used on animals.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members encountering vicious or aggressive animals may use a bureau issued less lethal weapon &nbsp;to stop an animal under the following conditions:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the animal presents an immediate danger to the life or personal safety of the member or other persons.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the animal interferes with the safety of the members or the execution of a police function or completion of a mission.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When necessary to secure an animal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may use their firearm to end the suffering of a badly injured animal and no other humane disposition is available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will exhaust all other practical means of containing or capturing a vicious or aggressive animal before discharging their firearm. &nbsp;If time allows, members will obtain permission from a supervisor.</p>
<p>3. Notification and Reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who discharge their firearm at an aggressive animal or to end the suffering of a badly injured animal shall write an appropriate report, which will be reviewed by a supervisor in accordance with Directive 1010.00, Use of Force.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who use a less lethal weapon on an animal shall document the use of force in an appropriate police report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who discharge a firearm at a vicious or aggressive animal or to end the suffering of a badly injured animal shall contact the Service Net to arrange for disposal of the animal.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For disposal of domestic animal remains, members will request MCAC to respond.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For disposal of wildlife animal remains, members will notify ODFW for the appropriate response and disposal in accordance with state Fish and Wildlife Commission regulations.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Warrant Service.</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will assist MCAC in warrant services when the animal control officer has knowledge of a potential problem and requests Bureau assistance to serve the warrant. Members will also assist if the animal control officer encounters a problem and immediate assistance is required.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Vendor Board-Up Contracts (Fiscal)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (631.65)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau recognizes that the community has entrusted it to provide emergency protection for property which has become damaged through criminal or accidental acts. Therefore, members will assist property owners by requesting emergency board-up assistance when a location is not secure or its security is at issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (631.65)</strong></p>
<p>Board-up contract vendor(s) will respond within one hour, 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Call out will be through the Bureau of Emergency Communication (BOEC). Fiscal Services Division (Fiscal) will keep BOEC supplied with a current list of board-up vendors.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Board-up vendor services are limited in scope: Vendors are only authorized to secure a location. Vendors are not authorized to provide such services as general debris removal, crime prevention through environmental design and other landscaping work. Members will not request or authorize work unrelated to securing the location.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Members will normally only request board-up services when an owner of the premise or other responsible person is unavailable. However, in the event an owner or other responsible person is available, but without the means to secure the property, members may order board-up services. Members will advise the recipient that the City will bill them for services rendered.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Due to liability claims resulting from screws being used in metal framed windows, vendors may have to enter the premises to secure these types of windows. Therefore, members will need to remain on the scene to allow the vendors to perform a board-up from the inside. There are very few of these types of board-ups per year.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Members requiring emergency board-up services will make their requests through BOEC via the appropriate talk group. Vendors are under contract to respond within one hour of notification.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;A written report is required whenever emergency board-up services are requested, used or canceled. Members will complete a Special Report if no other report (i.e., Investigation, Custody, etc.) is generated.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; If a member has problems with a board-up vendor, including their response time, it will be noted in the written report. The member will indicate on the report for a copy to be forwarded to the Operations Branch chief for action.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Fiscal Services Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Enter into contracts with board-up vendors.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Provide a current board-up vendor list to BOEC.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Process vendor invoices and forward appropriate copies to applicable parties (i.e., vendor, City&rsquo;s Risk Management&rsquo;s Collections Representative).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Records Division (Records) Responsibilities: In order to ensure appropriate billing, Records will forward copies of reports addressing emergency board-ups to Fiscal and Police Liability Management (Risk).</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Board-up Vendor Responsibilities: Abide by vendor contract, negotiated through Fiscal.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526155

<li>Human Resources Administrative Rule 11.01, Statement of Ethical Conduct</li>
<li>Directive 614.50, Release of Information</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p>1. The Portland Police Bureau believes in fostering positive press/media relations. As such, public information will be provided to the press/media in an accurate, timely, and detailed manner consistent with the law and public safety considerations.</p>
<p>2. It is the responsibility of all Bureau members to reasonably cooperate with the press/media. Press/media inquiries relating to police incidents will be handled expeditiously by the member in charge of the incident or their designee(s).</p>
<p>3. The Public Information Officer (PIO) serves as the Bureau&rsquo;s spokesperson, thus is responsible for coordinating communications. The PIO must be aware of Bureau activities that fall under the realm of news and keep command staff abreast of press/media interests. As a result, any member providing information to the press/media shall notify the PIO, about the nature of the request and the information released by the end of their shift.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<p>1. Notification of the Public Information Officer (PIO):</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Information Officer (PIO) is available to respond to any event which creates a substantial interest and response by the press/media, and when on scene members require support. The PIO may be contacted by telephone or pager for immediate response, or by email for simple notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidents that require notification of the PIO include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All homicides and major crimes of possible news interest.</p>
<p>1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious injury to a member.</p>
<p>1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious or extensive damage to city property.</p>
<p>1.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any explosion or bomb threat requiring Explosives Disposal Unit (EDU) response.</p>
<p>1.2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major incidents at large-scale events (e.g. stadiums, parks, schools, malls, etc.).</p>
<p>1.2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All incidents where police firearms are discharged during a police action or incident.</p>
<p>1.2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERT, CNT, or Major Crash Team activation.</p>
<p>1.2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serious hate/bias crimes.</p>
<p>1.2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidents causing, or likely to cause, unusual public concern or news media coverage.</p>
<p>1.2.10.&nbsp; Demonstrations or protests with arrest(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon notification of an incident or an issue of interest to the press/media, the PIO will notify the Police Commissioner, Chief of Police, Assistant Chiefs, and/or command staff as appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Releasing information to the press/media during an incident:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Information Officer (PIO) will generally be the source of information about the Bureau to the press/media. Members in charge of an incident may release information to the press/media in accordance with this Directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members in charge of an incident or their designee(s) will see that accurate information is released as soon as feasible, regardless of press/media deadlines, unless a specific time has been set for a news conference or the release of information is being handled by the PIO. Members may also refer media to the Media Resources section of the Bureau&rsquo;s website (<a href=""/police/63967"">http://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/63967</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same information will be released to all communications press/media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not prevent members of the news media from broadcasting, taking pictures, or taking video if they have the lawful right to be at the location. Members may ask the news media not to broadcast live during an active tactical incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any member releasing information to the press/media shall notify the PIO, about the nature of the request and the information released by the end of their shift. The PIO may be contacted by telephone or pager for immediate response, or by email for simple notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Directing press/media access on scene:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the scene of a major incident, press/media access may be restricted on scene or in airspace above until the member in charge or their designee(s) gives permission. Admittance to a crime scene on public property may also be limited if press/media presence would unreasonably obstruct or interfere with the investigation (e.g., gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses and victims, etc.), hamper the carrying out of police duties (e.g., handling an emergency situation), or jeopardize the safety of any person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of the press/media do not have the right to enter private property without consent of the property owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of a major incident, the press/media personnel may be directed to a safe location (media staging location).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; In hazardous areas members of the press/media may enter at their own risk, after a reasonable level of order or control has been established, and with the approval of the member in charge or their designee(s). At the scene of an emergency operation (e.g., fire, hostage situation, explosion, cave-in, etc.), members may deny or limit access to members of the press/media if their presence creates an unsafe situation for themselves or others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. General information release:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Information Officer (PIO) will generally be the source of information about the Bureau to the press/media. However, a member may be contacted by the press/media requesting official records. Because press/media requests regarding official records (e.g. police reports, photos, videos, etc.) must be made in writing and reviewed in accordance with applicable public record law, members will direct any press/media requesting official records to the Records Division, in accordance with Directive 614.50, Release of Information. Members should direct press/media requests for booking photos to the Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may also work with the PIO to prepare and distribute news releases of Bureau interest (e.g. awards, announcements, promotions, etc.). Members are encouraged to contact the PIO with a request and provide relevant information and any supporting materials to the PIO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (631.30)</strong></p>
<p>When a major crime has occurred in Portland and the victim, complainant or witness is located outside of our jurisdiction, the initial investigation will be conducted by the Bureau. For the purposes of this policy, a major crime is a homicide, rape, kidnapping, serious assault, extortion, armed robbery or any felony crime with identified suspect information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (631.30)</strong></p>
<p>If the complainant is located within a reasonable proximity to the city limits, the nearest district car will be dispatched to take the report. In these instances, BOEC will notify a patrol supervisor before dispatch. If the crime in question is cold (i.e., not having occurred within four hours of the report) and it is convenient to the reporting party, the reporting party should be directed to the nearest Bureau precinct where the report will be taken. In these instances, BOEC will alert the precinct. If the reporting party is located such a distance from Portland that neither of the foregoing alternatives appears feasible, Detectives should be consulted for direction. BOEC should attempt to solicit normal, over-the-phone data from the reporting party to facilitate immediate attention to suspect or evidentiary information.</p>
<p>For all non-major crimes being reported from a location outside our jurisdiction and having occurred inside the city, the complainant will be asked to either go to the nearest Bureau precinct to meet a member within the city or to report the crime by telephone.</p>
<p>For incidents occurring outside the city and the request originates from an address inside our jurisdiction, a unit will be dispatched or the report will be accepted over the telephone. A copy of the report will be routed to the appropriate police agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Requests (631.30)</strong></p>
<p>Routine patrol will not be provided for areas outside of the city, unless approved by a patrol supervisor. The supervisor shall then notify the Relief Commander. Those exceptions should be based on a temporary need by another agency due to a short-term situation. No long-term exceptions will be approved.</p>
<p>Units will respond to priority 1 and 2 calls involving a threat to life in other jurisdictions adjacent to the city limits when requested by that jurisdiction. A supervisor will be notified any time a member is dispatched outside the city limits. Non-life-threatening priority 2 and lower priority calls will not be dispatched without prior approval from a patrol supervisor.</p>
<p>Our participation in another jurisdiction should be to contain the situation and hold it for police personnel from that jurisdiction to arrive. In some cases, a courtesy report will need to be made then submitted to and forwarded from our Records Division to their Records Unit. Under no circumstances will members dispute any call with the dispatcher. They will accept the call and contact a supervisor for advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SERT, EDU and Hostage Negotiations (631.30)</strong></p>
<p>Response to requests by an outside agency for the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT), Explosives Disposal Unit (EDU) and Hostage Negotiator Team (HNT) will follow the procedures outlined in DIR 720.00 SERT and HNT, Outside Agency Requests.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (631.10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Radio Procedures: Due to the prevalence of radio monitors, specific radio codes will be used in describing the type of death the officer is at. The code 55-A will be used when describing a homicide situation. The code 55-K will be used when describing all other deaths.</p>
<p>Medical Response: &nbsp;If the officer observes any signs of life, medical shall be requested to the scene to provide medical attention or determine death. &nbsp;Medical personnel on scene will determine whether the patient will be transported to a medical facility.</p>
<p>Preservation of a Death Scene:&nbsp; &nbsp;If there is a possibility that a crime has been committed, the scene will be preserved by the officers and supervisors on scene until relieved by an investigator or supervisor from the investigative detail.</p>
<p>When death has been established, the following actions shall be taken:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Medical Examiner&rsquo;s office shall be contacted and provided the details and circumstances surrounding the death. When death appears to have resulted from natural causes and no physician is available to sign the death certificate, or it is uncertain if a physician will sign the death certificate, the Medical Examiner (ME) shall be notified. The member may contact the ME&rsquo;s office directly or request the ME through BOEC. After discussing the circumstances with the member, the ME may choose to respond to the scene or authorize the release of the remains to a mortuary.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member shall not disturb the body or property at the scene of the death, nor permit any other person, other than the ME, to do so (exception noted in paragraph c. 1). Access to the scene should be restricted to preserve evidence.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The member shall assist the ME in investigating the conditions surrounding the death.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the death appears to have resulted from natural causes and a licensed physician who will sign the death certificate responds to the scene, members have no further responsibility except to provide any reasonable assistance requested by the deceased&rsquo;s family in their time of need. Members may occasionally be called to the scene of the death of a hospice patient. Hospice situations in MultnomahCounty can be identified by the presence of a red envelope containing medical information and orders. Hospice patients are under the care of a licensed physician who will sign the death certificate; therefore, the above procedure is applicable.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;When death has apparently resulted from an apparent drug overdose, suicide, or natural causes (with no family or physician present) and there is no suspicion of foul play, the member shall immediately notify the ME&rsquo;s office. The ME will respond to the scene and verify the cause of death. If there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, the body will be removed by the ME and the member will prepare the appropriate investigative report.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; If the ME determines that suspicious circumstances exist or there is evidence that will assist in identifying a suspect involved in the distribution of the drugs associated with the overdose case, the ME may request the member to:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact the Homicide sergeant on duty during business hours or the on-call Homicide sergeant after hours, and have them respond to the scene to investigate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact DVD sergeant during business hours or the on-call DVD sergeant after hours, and have them respond to the scene to investigate the drug connection surrounding the overdose.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;The examination of the body and the determination of the cause and manner of death will be the responsibility of the ME&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; The responsibility for the criminal investigation will be assumed by the investigating detectives or a detective sergeant upon their arrival.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the member determines that the death is an obvious homicide or the circumstances exist that may lead to a homicide investigation, the Homicide sergeant on duty during business hours or the on-call Homicide sergeant after hours, shall be contacted by the supervisor on the scene.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The ME shall also be notified of the homicide or the suspicious death. The ME may choose to defer responding to the scene until after the initial assessment by the Homicide sergeant.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When death has resulted from a traffic accident, the Traffic Division shall be responsible for the complete investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident and exchange information, as necessary, with the ME&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp; When a death has occurred on a waterway with the City, MCSO will be responsible for the investigation. If a death, or a crime leading to a death, occurs on land, but the body is found in a waterway, Bureau members will be responsible for the investigation. &nbsp;MCSO will assist the Bureau with retrieval and transportation of the body, if needed. &nbsp;If a body is found in a waterway, and the initial investigation is unable to determine the investigative responsibility for the scene, detectives and MCSO will consult with each other to determine the responsibility for the investigation.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the body is to be turned over to the ME&rsquo;s office, it shall be searched by a representative of that office only. Members will not search the body unless otherwise directed by the ME&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who has been in charge of the body until the arrival of the ME will remain and be present during the search. &nbsp;The member shall, when possible, remain and sign the ME&rsquo;s property receipt as a witness. The member will then be provided a copy of the receipt and will attach it to his/her report.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;It shall be the responsibility of the assigned member to protect the body and its effects from theft or tampering prior to the arrival of the ME.</p>
<p>m. It is the responsibility of the ME&rsquo;s office to notify relatives or friends of the deceased. &nbsp;The Bureau shall honor any reasonable request from the ME&rsquo;s office for assistance in this matter.</p>
<p>When investigative details are contacted or summoned to a death scene, the following responsibilities are to be followed:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Drugs and Vice Division (DVD) Responsibilities</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; The principal criteria for mounting a DVD investigation response will be the presence of actionable investigative leads that offer a strong likelihood of identifying a suspect involved in the distribution of the drugs associated with the overdose death.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; The DVD sergeant will evaluate the information provided by the responding officers and determine whether to call out an investigator. &nbsp;If the DVD sergeant believes the case may be something other than an overdose, he/she will re-contact the Detective Division. &nbsp;The Forensic Evidence Division (Forensics) will be contacted for photographs when DVD responds to investigate an overdose death. The DVD investigator will coordinate the investigation with the ME&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;If DVD declines to respond, members will conduct the case as any death investigation:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Members will assist the ME&rsquo;s office and write a report.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Identify and collect any evidence they believe may be relevant (after consultation with the ME&rsquo;s office).</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Contact the DVD sergeant if any new information develops that may lead to identification of the drug dealer.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Homicide Detail Responsibilities:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; The Homicide sergeant will communicate with the supervisor on the scene to ensure that the scene and evidence are being preserved.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; The Homicide sergeant will coordinate the response of the detectives, criminalists from Forensics, the district attorney&rsquo;s office, the ME, and any support units necessary for the investigation.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon arrival, the Homicide sergeant or designee will assume command of the scene and the investigation.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp; Criminalists from Forensics will process the scene and collect any evidence identified as pertinent to the investigation.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;When requested to respond, or if already present, the ME assumes responsibility for the body and the removal of the body from the scene.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526151

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (630.40)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Advanced Life Support (ALS) ambulances: Privately owned ambulances staffed, equipped and licensed by MultnomahCounty (Mult. Co.) to provide pre-hospital emergency medical care and patient transport for either life threatening or non-life threatening medical emergencies.</p>
<p>City Cab: A cab, its fare paid by the Mult. Co. Health Division, used to provide non-emergency, indigent medical transportation to a hospital emergency department.</p>
<p>Fire rescue units: Specially designed fire apparatus staffed, equipped and licensed to provide pre-hospital emergency medical care for life threatening medical emergencies.</p>
<p>First response (Fire): A fire engine, truck company or fire rescue capable of providing advanced first aid medical care and are dispatched under BOEC operating procedures to most medical calls to provide Basic Life Support (BLS) until an ALS ambulance arrives.</p>
<p>Medical Dispatch: Housed within BOEC, is responsible for operating a centralized emergency medical call receipt and dispatch function serving all of Mult. Co.</p>
<p>Office of Emergency Medical Services (EMS): A Mult. Co. agency responsible for overseeing EMS, licensing/approving ambulance companies and fire departments to operate as EMS service providers and establishing dispatch protocols used by BOEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Telephone Requests (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>Members who receive telephone calls requesting ambulance service should either:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Tell the caller to dial 9-1-1.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Transfer the call to 9-1-1.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain the exact location where the ambulance is needed, the caller&rsquo;s phone number, a brief description of the emergency and relay the information to BOEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Requests Through Police Dispatchers (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>Members may order EMS through the dispatcher on any operational police radio channel. The police dispatcher should be provided the following information:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Exact location of the emergency.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The type of incident involved, (i.e., traffic accident, shooting, illness, cutting, fire, heart attack, etc.).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The requested response (Code 1 or 3).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;The number of persons needing medical attention.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Hazards at the scene, if any.</p>
<p>The dispatcher will relay the information to the medical dispatcher, who will dispatch the appropriate type of ambulance (fire rescue, Code 1 ambulance or Code 3 ambulance). All requests for medical response will be honored, including requests for fire rescue first aid calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Specifying Code 1 or Code 3 Response (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>When ordering EMS, members may specifically request a Code 1 or Code 3 response. An ALS ambulance is dispatched on all (both Code 1 and Code 3) police requests for service. Specifying the type of response should be done only when the member, based on the apparent signs and symptoms, is able to distinguish between life threatening and non-life threatening conditions. Examples of life threatening emergencies are, but are not limited to, when the patient is:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Unconscious.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Not breathing.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;In shock.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Experiencing chest pains and has:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;A history of heart problems.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Shortness of breath.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Age over 30 years.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Displaying bizarre behavior (violence, extreme strength, immunity from pain etc.) associated with drug induced psychosis/excited delirium, or extreme mental disturbance.</p>
<p>Based on information provided when the request for service is made, BOEC may send a Code 3 response, even if a Code 1 is requested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Police Response on Medical Calls (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>BOEC will dispatch members in addition to medical responders, when the reported incident is, or appears to be, within the scope of the police mission, (i.e., the protection of life or the investigation of a crime). BOEC will be alert to circumstances requiring police involvement such as child abuse/neglect, attempt suicide, unattended (by medical authority) deaths, etc.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations where there exists doubt, due to possible criminal action or where hazardous conditions exist, a unit will be dispatched. Incidents, which require police and medical response, will necessitate simultaneous dispatch.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If the location of the reported incident is determined to be unstable due to a hazardous situation (i.e., a dangerous suspect present who is not yet in custody), emergency responders will be staged at a remote location until the situation is stabilized.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after arriving at the scene, a member determines that fire suppression or other PFB action is required, the member will notify the dispatcher and request the specific fire equipment that is needed. Members should never assume that Fire&rsquo;s medical responder will be equipped for fire suppression, extraction or other action.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;EMS response should not be canceled unless nothing is found or there are no patients or victims at the scene. EMS response may be slowed down from Code 3 to Code 1 when no care appears to be needed, a patient requires only first aid or the patient refuses treatment and/or transport.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>City Cabs (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>If a medical transportation request involves a non-emergency injury or illness and the patient is indigent, a City Cab will be used. BOEC is authorized to order a City Cab in response to telephone requests from indigent persons wanting non-emergency medical transportation to the nearest hospital emergency department. The patient will be taken to the nearest hospital. Members will not specify a hospital. If a patient is currently being treated at a hospital other than the nearest one, the member must inform the dispatcher when the cab is ordered. Without BOEC authorization, the cab will take the patient to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>Generally, the sick or injured person should be physically able to make or confirm the request for transportation. In doubtful situations, an ambulance will be dispatched. Members will order City Cabs through the Service Net. The taxi company designated by BOEC, through monthly rotation, will be dispatched. Welfare patients are not eligible for City Cabs. If the patient has a welfare card, they must call the cab company themselves and give them the name of his/her caseworker.</p>
<p>City Cab transportation is one way to the hospital only. The patient must find his/her own transportation home. City Cabs do not transport to the Veterans (VA) Hospital. Patients destined for the VA Hospital should contact the hospital directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Accident Victims (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>Persons injured in traffic accidents will not be transported in taxis to seek medical care, unless the victim specifically requests transportation by taxi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Air Ambulances (Life Flight) (630.40)</strong></p>
<p>Life Flight will be ordered through BOEC. &nbsp;Life Flight should be considered when:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Patient(s) are suffering from serious burn injuries; fire, chemical, radiation, etc.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;There are five or more patients with serious injuries.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient(s) with life threatening injuries/illnesses require transportation to a hospital from a remote or inaccessible (from the ground) locations e.g., freeway accidents where ground traffic is seriously impeded).</p>
<p>During nighttime operations and as the aircraft approaches, members should never shine lights directly at the aircraft as bright lights may blind the pilot. Members should use their vehicle&rsquo;s overhead lights to help the pilot identify the landing zone&rsquo;s perimeter.</p>
<p>Once the aircraft has landed, members should never approach the aircraft unless directed to do so by a flight crewmember. If directed to approach the aircraft, members should approach from the front only. Members should never transport a patient to the aircraft alone but rather wait within a safe area for the flight nurse to approach and prepare the victim for transport.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/526143

This work should be coordinated with the City of Portland graffiti abatement coordinator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notifications/Enforcement (630.29)</strong></p>
<p>At the direction of the commander, the owner(s) of record and/or the responsible party, may be notified in writing using the Graffiti Nuisance Property Warning Letter, delivered by mail or in person, that their property has been identified as a potential Graffiti Nuisance Property.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau has the duty and responsibility to pursue and apprehend offenders. Foot pursuits must be conducted in such a way so as to minimize the risks to sworn members and citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foot Pursuits in General (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>Foot pursuits are inherently dangerous police actions. It is the policy of the Bureau that the safety of sworn members and the public shall be the overriding consideration in determining whether a foot pursuit will be initiated or continued. Foot pursuits occur in a wide variety of circumstances. Therefore, this policy is intended as a general guideline for sworn members when deciding if such pursuits are warranted and how they should be conducted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (630.15)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Foot pursuit: A pursuit on foot by a sworn member(s) where visual contact is maintained, and the suspect is readily capable of being apprehended by the pursuing sworn member(s).</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;A foot pursuit should end when the sworn member(s) loses visual contact with the suspect for more than a brief period of time (1-2 seconds), and a tactical apprehension should begin.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sworn members can re-engage in a foot pursuit when he/she regains visual contact of the suspect and the suspect is readily capable of being apprehended.</p>
<p>Tactical apprehension strategies for the search and apprehension of the suspect could be accomplished by:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sworn member follows and maintains constant visual contact while waiting for additional resources for apprehension.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Perimeter search.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Block search.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Cover/contact search.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;K9 track.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Air Support Unit.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;Activation of SERT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deciding Whether to Pursue (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>A sworn member has the authority to stop any person reasonably suspected of having committed or is about to commit a crime, violation or traffic violation. While it is the sworn member who initiates the stop, it is the suspect who initiates the foot pursuit by fleeing. The decision to pursue should be made with an awareness of the degree of risk to which the sworn member exposes himself/herself and others.</p>
<p>No sworn member shall be criticized for deciding against initiating, discontinuing his/her involvement in or terminating a foot pursuit.</p>
<p>Foot pursuits and tactical apprehensions present certain inherent risks, yet both are an important law enforcement tool. The principles outlined below should be considered when initiating, continuing or terminating a foot pursuit or tactical apprehension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Factors to Consider When Initiating/Continuing a Foot Pursuit (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Whether the suspect is believed to be or known to be armed.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Suspect&rsquo;s behaviors:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Looking back may be an indication the suspect is targeting or &ldquo;sizing up&rdquo; a pursuing sworn member.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Change in stride or pace or efforts to draw a sworn member in or allow a sworn member to close may indicate the suspect is preparing for an attack.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Hand and shoulder movement is an indicator the suspect may be reaching into the waistband or other threat areas.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Holding an area of clothing to keep a weapon from falling out.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Conditions:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Locations:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Residential.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Commercial.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp; Roadways.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;Schools.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;Wooded or isolated areas.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Environmental factors: Weather or darkness.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Communications.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Availability and proximity of cover units.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Sworn member&rsquo;s characteristics:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Physical conditioning and abilities.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Familiarity with the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sworn Member Responsibilities (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Once the foot pursuit has been initiated, the pursuing sworn member should notify BOEC and attempt to broadcast the following information:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The suspect&rsquo;s direction of travel.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Whether the suspect is armed, if known.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Number of fleeing suspects.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The reason for the pursuit.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If &nbsp;known, the identification of the suspect, or a physical description.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Generally, the pursuing sworn member should not attempt to overtake the fleeing suspect but keep the suspect in sight until sufficient cover is available to take him/her into custody. The following are techniques to consider:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Following and maintaining a safe distance.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Paralleling the suspect.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Cover/contact pursuits (two sworn members).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Following a different route than the suspect (i.e., wide corners).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Using available cover (i.e., parked cars).</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary sworn member should attempt to immediately coordinate with secondary sworn members to establish a perimeter in the area to contain the suspect. Secondary sworn members may assist with the coordination if the primary sworn member is unable to do so.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Complete all applicable reports needed to document the incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Foot Pursuit Restrictions (630.15)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The pursuing sworn member, if appropriate, will attempt tactical apprehension strategies. Sworn members will not engage in or continue in a foot pursuit when instructed not to by a supervisor. Sworn members should not engage in or continue foot pursuits in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Armed suspects unless, in extreme circumstances, no other alternative strategy is feasible and a delay in the apprehension of the suspect would present a threat of death or serious physical injury to others.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;In the event that a suspect enters a building, structure, wooded area or otherwise isolated area sworn members, unless in extreme circumstances, will not pursue suspects into these areas without sufficient cover present.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sworn member believes that the danger to the pursuing sworn member or the public outweighs the necessity for immediate apprehension.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If the sworn member is disarmed.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;If the sworn member loses contact with BOEC and no other means of communication exists.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;If the sworn member loses visual contact of the suspect(s) for more than a brief period of time (1-2 seconds).</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;The sworn member is not familiar with and is unable to communicate the direction of travel or location sufficient enough for other sworn members to assist.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;The sworn member is unsure of his/her location.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;If instructed to do so by a supervisor.</p>

<ul>
<li>ORS 146.095 Responsibility for investigation</li>
<li>ORS 146.109 Notification of next-of-kin&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>POLICY (612.10)</strong></p>
<p>By law (ORS 146.109), the Medical Examiner&rsquo;s (ME) Office is responsible for conducting next-of-kin notification for deaths requiring investigation in the State of Oregon. &nbsp;On occasion, members of the Portland Police Bureau may be asked to make that notification, or convey an emergency message on behalf of the ME&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp; To the extent that the request will not interfere with either the statutory duties of the medical examiner or any investigation, the member will attempt to provide this service to the community in a humane and compassionate manner.</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (612.10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Death message: Any message related to death or serious injury.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Medical Examiner Notifications (612.10)</strong></p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the ME&rsquo;s Office to notify relatives or friends of the deceased when they are involved in a death investigation. However, members will honor any reasonable request from the ME&rsquo;s Office for assistance in these matters.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outside Agency Notifications (612.10)</strong></p>
<p>If the request for the delivery of a death message originates from an outside agency, a member will be dispatched. The member receiving the call will be requested to call the dispatch coordinator for the information. Name(s) of the deceased or injured person(s) will not be transmitted on the police radio net.</p>
<p>Death messages will normally be delivered by the member handling the call. However, the member may use discretion as to whether to actually deliver the message or have the person call the originating agency concerning the emergency. Messages which contain incomplete information or do not clearly indicate the nature of the problem should usually be handled by informing the relative or friend to call and receive the message directly from the originating agency. If the member elects to have the message delivered by the originating agency, the member will remain at the scene while the call is being made to ensure that the message has been received and the person will require no further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On Scene Notifications (612.10)</strong></p>
<p>It is important that the family is notified in person or a member stands by during telephone notification by the originating agency. This allows the member to assess the appropriate services the family may need. When notifying non-English speaking families it is important to have translation services ready and available to assist. Volunteer chaplains can be a valuable aid to members dealing with grieving families by freeing members to focus on other immediate police functions while the chaplains work with the family. When a volunteer chaplain is appropriate, the member will make the request through the dispatch coordinator. &nbsp;Bureau of Emergency Communication (BOEC) will then make the request for a volunteer chaplain through the volunteer chaplain coordinator. &nbsp;Since grief and bereavement may cause varied reactions ranging from none at all to a strong emotional reaction and even violence, safety is a first priority. The ultimate responsibility for the scene of the death investigation rests with the District Attorney and the ME for the county.</p>
<p>In incidents where the volunteer chaplain service is not utilized, but there exists a need for crisis intervention, the member may request a volunteer through the Crisis Response Team (CRT) coordinator. This request will be made through the Dispatch Coordinator at BOEC. The CRT coordinator will make contact with the requesting member.</p>
<p>In cases where the family is present at the scene of the death investigation and the family has made a request to view the body prior to the removal by a representative from the ME&rsquo;s Office, it must be mutually agreed upon by the ME, the District Attorney, and the investigative agency prior to any on scene viewing. All entities will take into consideration safety at the scene, evidentiary concerns, the state of the body and the family&rsquo;s emotional needs.</p>
<p>Some survivors may wish to know as many details as possible, while others may not. In cases where the resulting death or serious injury is under investigation, the details relating to the condition of the body or descriptions of injuries shall not be released to family members until the investigating agency has been consulted. In those cases, members shall refer the family to the investigating entity.</p>
<p>Once the body has been turned over to the ME&rsquo;s Office or its representative, the ME is responsible for the proper chain of custody relating to the body and its associated property. The body will remain in the custody of the ME&rsquo;s Office until the ME arranges for the proper release.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/525803

<p><strong>Response Goals (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Bureau of Emergency Communication (BOEC) Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Set and meet goals regarding the time from call receipt to dispatch of Priority E, 1 and 2 calls.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Dispatch Priority E, 1 and 2 calls immediately.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify a PPB supervisor when priority 3 calls are holding longer than 30 minutes and priority 4 calls holding longer than 1 hour.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Always subject to Priority E, 1 and 2 calls.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If possible, self-dispatch on priority 3 calls within 30 minutes and priority 4 calls within 1 hour.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Respond to calls in a manner that provides the best possible service to the community and reflects response goals.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>

<p>d. &nbsp;Operations Branch Chief&rsquo;s Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Set and manage response goals for Priority 3 and 4 calls.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Periodically review and adjust response goals, as appropriate.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Data Computer (MDC) and Computer Assisted Dispatch System <strong>(CAD) (612.00)</strong></strong></p>
<p>Members will comply with all laws and regulations regarding computer systems. The MDC/CAD is for official use only and any system or e-mail messages that contain sexual, racial, degrading or suggestive remarks are prohibited. Personal messages may be sent, but they must conform to standards. Limited personal messages may be sent provided these are incidental, of short duration and conform to standards. All messages and e-mail in the CAD are subject to review and privacy should not be expected. Members will not use unauthorized software or RAM cards in the MDC.</p>
<p>Members will not release information from computer data bases to the public. Requests for information of this nature should be directed to the Records Division (Records). Radio call information requests, which cannot be answered by accessing CAD, should be directed to BOEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Radio Use (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>Police operations (dispatch) talkgroups are used for routine communications between BOEC and units. They will not be used for car-to-car communications unless during an emergency. No car-to-car, car-to-office or pursuit transmissions are permitted on the service net.</p>
<p>Police tactical talkgroups are used for the coordination of a single event where remaining on an operational talkgroup is disruptive or unsafe. TAC I is available as a back-up to the main dispatch net. A dispatcher will use this talkgroup when the dispatch talkgroup is not functioning or if non-emergency traffic is restricted on that talkgroup. TAC II is for units to coordinate responses to on-going incidents. TAC III is for tactical &amp; undercover missions. Other tactical talkgroups are controlled by the division/unit to which the net is assigned.</p>
<p>Administrative talkgroups are used for communications from car to car or units to their offices. Division/units with an assigned administrative talkgroup will always monitor this talkgroup in addition to their operational talkgroup.</p>
<p>Requests for BOEC dispatcher support on non-operational talkgroups should be made as far in advance as possible. Copies of applicable operation orders should be forwarded to BOEC in advance. When the need for additional support is immediate, the request may be made verbally by a supervisor to a BOEC supervisor.</p>
<p>For further details refer to the PPB Radio Template on the Intranet.</p>
<p>NE DP &ndash; no longer used for auto records. May be used as an additional dispatch channel as needed as well as for special events (Rose Festival, VIP visits, demonstrations).</p>

<p>COMM 1 and 2 &ndash; used for law enforcement communications within Multnomah County.</p>
<p>MU Law 1 and 2 (renamed from Law 1 and 2) &ndash; region wide law enforcement channel. Clackamas and Washington counties also have a Law 1 and 2 which are WA Law 1, 2 and CC Law 1.</p>
<p>PPB auto records &ndash; auto records will monitor this channel.</p>
<p>US Marsh &ndash; tactical channel for US Marshals service, no dispatcher.</p>
<p>OHSU SEC &ndash; dispatcher for OHSU security 24/7.</p>
<p>A, B and C channels &ndash; used by all 800 radio users for large events. &nbsp;Metro A, B and C are renamed MULT A, B and C. &nbsp;Clark County and Washington County also have A, B and C.</p>
<p>Stanton &ndash; 24 hour dispatch for Portland Bureau of Maintenance.</p>
<p>Water &ndash; 24 hour dispatch for Portland Water Bureau.</p>
<p>USCG &ndash; 24 hour dispatch for USCG Station, Portland.</p>
<p>Zone G contains national and state talk groups that function separately from the Portland radio systems. &ldquo;I&rdquo; channels are national channels. &ldquo;ICALL&rdquo; is monitored by BOEC. OROPS 1-5 are for use by the State of Oregon agencies and use repeaters in the Metro area. &nbsp;Channels 2 and 5 are generally used by law enforcement. WAOPS are used in the State of Washington and are not repeated in the Portland-Vancouver region.&nbsp; These channels can also be used in a simplex mode when the user turns off the repeated function in the pack set or car radio.</p>
<p>Zone H is an emergency use zone in case of a catastrophic failure of the Portland radio towers. &nbsp;Officers will be directed to specific channels that use radio towers from either Vancouver, Washington County or Clackamas County.</p>
<p>Eagle 2 &ndash; used for car-to-car between Clark County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and Vancouver Police Department.</p>
<p>WA SNET &ndash; serves as the Service Net for Washington County during peak usage. During early morning hours, it is the combined dispatch for South Cities dispatch and Hillsboro dispatch.</p>
<p>OSP-12 &ndash; the cross patch for OSP patrols in the Gorge area of Multnomah County. When broadcasting, advise the OSP dispatcher you are on &ldquo;12.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WA Buxon and Roundtop &ndash; are additional repeaters of WA SO1 used to extend range further into western Washington County.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When receiving transmissions, respond with his/her unit number and location and, if necessary, repeat received information to verify accuracy.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Transmit messages by announcing his/her unit number, await acknowledgement and state the message.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Transmit emergency messages by stating his/her unit number and Emergency. All other units will cease transmissions until the emergency transmission is completed.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Switch to the appropriate talk group when dispatched to another precinct/agency. When communicating on another agency&rsquo;s talk group, preface his/her unit number with our agency name, (i.e., Portland Police 850).</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Request phone calls be made by his/her precinct/office on an administrative net or on Private Call. Members will not request the Service net to make telephone calls.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Ensure members comply with appropriate radio use.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Extraordinary requests for BOEC support on non-operational talk groups should be made in writing, though channels. Copies of Operation Orders should be forwarded to BOEC in advance. When the need for such support is immediate, the request may be made verbally to a BOEC supervisor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BOEC Record Policy and Information Requests (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>BOEC does not directly release any information to the media. All release of BOEC information is done through the user agency responsible for the response.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Radio Recordings: BOEC retains all voice recordings for 30 months. Requests for recordings should be routed through a supervisor, to BOEC. Recording requests should identify specific information needed, (i.e., East Talkgroup pursuit through 10-61 or incoming call only. If a member feels that the Master Voice Logging recording needs to be retained longer than 30 months, they must contact BOEC for directions on placing a hold on the master recording. Recordings are generally copied and returned within 10 days of request. Priority is given to recordings required by the courts or those used in ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;CAD Data: Available to each user through the CAD terminals in patrol vehicles, precincts, and various other divisions. The CAD maintains on-line Unit Histories for one month and Incident Histories for seven months. BOEC maintains some limited CAD data in off-line files, which can be retrieved by forwarding a written request, through channels, to the Director of BOEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Radio Call Numbers (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>RU managers may assign numbers, including unassigned numbers, within their designated block of numbers. However, all changes and/or modifications must be forwarded to the Strategic Services Division (SSD). Those number blocks identified as Reserved cannot be assigned without Strategic Services&rsquo; approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Status Codes (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>Members will use the following codes in transmissions, rather than clear voice:</p>

<p><strong>Special Files (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>The CAD has the capability of creating and maintaining special files to provide information to members as incidents arise. Each special file has its own characteristics as outlined below:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Special Interest File: Contains information that is operationally useful, is not already flagged in PPDS and does not involve probable cause to arrest. Information is automatically purged in 72 hours, unless another expiration date is entered. Entries could include: safety concerns, information which could help solve a crime and other timely information. Members are responsible for deleting information, which is no longer useful.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Vehicle/Suspect File: A file with probable cause information relative to vehicles and suspects. This file has an automatic 72-hour purge factor. Entries require supervisor approval.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Member responsibilities when using the vehicle/suspect file.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Write a report prior to making the entry (a suspect alert report will suffice).</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Delete information which is no longer useful.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Supervisor&nbsp; Responsibility: Approve&nbsp; entry&nbsp; and&nbsp; enter&nbsp; Bureau&nbsp; I.D. number in the Reason for Contact field.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Premise Information File: A file with information relative to a specific address as it relates to officer safety, enhanced or altered response or other information.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Permanent entries can only be added by a BOEC supervisor.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Member Responsibility: Requests entry in writing on an interoffice memo and gain approval by a Bureau supervisor.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Supervisor Responsibility: Review and forward approved requests to BOEC before the end of the shift.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Temporary entries (1 &ndash;7 days) may be made verbally to the BOEC dispatcher or entered via MDC. Information entered in this fashion will automatically purge after seven days.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Telephone Report Unit (TRU) (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>During TRU operation hours, referring a call to TRU should be coordinated through the dispatcher.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emergency Procedures for BOEC (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>If communications are disabled due to equipment failure or an incident, which causes BOEC to be evacuated, the following will be in effect and will remain in effect until BOEC is able to correct the problem, return to their building or until Bureau supervisors are informed by a BOEC supervisor that alternate procedures should be followed. In the event of a partial radio system failure in which some but not all the primary talkgroups are inoperable, members will move to an operable primary talkgroup, check in, and wait for instructions.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Ascertain whether the problem is with the radio or the system.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If the problem is a system problem:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Break contact with the public as soon as possible.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Go to the nearest precinct or firehouse and contact his/her supervisor or desk clerk.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Remain at or return to standby location as directed.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Ascertain the nature of the malfunction from BOEC.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Initiate command notifications.</p>

<p>5. &nbsp;Conduct a roll call as soon as possible and locate missing units.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Dispatch units on Priority E, 1 and 2 calls only with at least one cover unit, unless the primary unit is a two member unit.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Dispatch at least four units on Code 0 calls.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Instruct units to return to standby location after their call.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Basic BOEC Responsibilities (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Process and prioritize incoming calls.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Dispatch calls in accordance with the Unit Assignment Table.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Dispatch Priority E, 1 and 2 calls to the district unit and if the unit is not available, any unit in the precinct within a reasonable proximity to the incident will be assigned the call. In the event those units are unavailable, the closest unit, regardless of precinct assignment, will be assigned the incident.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispatch according to the following minimum response guidelines (members may cancel additional units upon arrival):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Priority E Calls: Two members will be dispatched.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Priority 1 and 2 Calls: Two members will be dispatched.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Priority 3 and 4 Calls: One member will be dispatched.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Code 0 Calls: Four units will be dispatched.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Cover Requests: One member will be dispatched when the requesting &nbsp;member has not designated how many units are needed.</p>

<p>e. &nbsp;Refer calls to other appropriate members, (i.e., TRU, desk clerks, I&amp;R, etc.).</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Voice dispatch calls to units not having a MDC, (i.e., traffic units, bicycle patrols and mounted patrols).</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebroadcast on all operational talkgroups information relative to urgent incidents. Incident information occurring in an adjacent precinct/agency, which could create an officer safety situation, will also be broadcast on the adjacent precinct/agency&rsquo;s talkgroup. Urgent incidents are situations where any of the following occurs:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Officer in trouble.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Armed robbery in progress or just occurred.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Shooting just occurred.</p>

If a field supervisor is unavailable, the dispatcher may direct these movements of units and notify a supervisor when practical.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;Notify the field supervisor if pending calls for service appear to be unusually heavy in any one</p>
<p>district or area.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; &nbsp;BOEC supervisors may raise or lower a call priority when appropriate. Decisions made by a BOEC supervisor regarding a call priority may not be changed without a Bureau supervisor&rsquo;s approval, unless circumstances dictate otherwise.</p>
<p>m. The 9-1-1 center dispatching a pursuit will contact other 9-1-1 centers and provide the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Agency in pursuit.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Reason for the pursuit.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Vehicle/suspect description.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Direction of pursuit.</p>
<p>n.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other 9-1-1 centers will advise their members of the pursuit and the talkgroup it is on.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;The pursuit crosses jurisdictional lines and that agency assumes the pursuit, the 9-1-1 center for the assuming agency will dispatch the pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Basic Member Responsibilities (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go in service, out of service and end his/her shift by MDC. Members will log on with the MDC with the following information:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Unit number.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Shift.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Bureau I.D. number.</p>

<p>b. &nbsp;FTOs with trainees will notify the dispatcher by voice/MDC when they are a Training Car and considered a one member car for cover purposes.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Complete calls received from BOEC as if received directly from a supervisor. Members will acknowledge calls without comment unless additional information is needed. If a member objects to a Priority E, 1 or 2 call, the member will complete the call, then object through appropriate channels, unless:</p>
<p>1. The call or directive is altered or countermanded by a supervisor, at which time that supervisor&rsquo;s name and/or Bureau I.D. number will be entered into the CAD.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If he/she has good reason to believe that the dispatcher&rsquo;s directive entails a potential violation of law or policy or is an unnecessary risk to the safety of members or the public, then he/she may immediately contact a Bureau supervisor for a resolution.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Monitor radio and MDC, except while in court, at MCDC, etc.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Respond to a dispatched higher priority call while servicing a lower priority call.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Respond, arrive and communicate tactical information via voice to Priority E, 1 and 2 calls or calls with cover. Members may update to On Scene by MDC, if tactically necessary.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;For Priority 3, 4 and 5 calls:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Regularly, and after clearing a call, review calls holding within his/ her district and in adjoining districts on the MDC and assign themselves to calls when necessary to maintain response time goals.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Notify a supervisor if unable to respond to a call in a timely manner.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Before taking a holding call, consider the length of time the call has held, the nature of the call, the member&rsquo;s reasonable proximity factors (distance, time, shift conditions, unit availability and practicality) and the member&rsquo;s personal knowledge of the call.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Assign themselves to Priority 3 and 4 calls by MDC.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Request cover as necessary.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Notify the dispatcher and a supervisor when unavailable for calls for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;Before making a traffic stop, attempt to check the vehicle&rsquo;s plate by MDC first, and then give the following information by voice or MDC:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Unit number and 10-84 (wait for dispatcher to acknowledge).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Vehicle license plate or description.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Location.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the MDC for routine status changes, (i.e., 10-81, 10-82, etc.), and include &nbsp;the location.</p>
<p>j. &nbsp;&nbsp; If practical, use the MDC Self-initiated Activity Mask when initiating non-cover activity.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp; Requests for medical and fire assistance will be done via voice on Police Talkgroups only. In tactical situations where EMS is staging, members may use PFB DP to advise the medical/fire personnel when it is safe to enter the scene.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; &nbsp;The first member at the scene of a major incident or tactical situation requiring two or more units will assume control of the scene until relieved by a supervisor.</p>
<p>m. Members will broadcast any Attempt to Locate or Information of Interest via voice prior to closing the call.</p>
<p>n. &nbsp;Recommend to supervisors the denial of service based on repeated requests to a chronic location or situation for which there is no resolution.</p>
<p>o. &nbsp;Request cover for his/her self-dispatched calls.</p>
<p>p. &nbsp;Immediately contact Records after stolen or recovered vehicle reports are taken.</p>
<p>q. &nbsp;Take Priority 3 and 4 calls up to 30 minutes prior to the end of the shift (supervisors may override this policy on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>r.&nbsp; &nbsp;Non-emergency call backs should be done by the members or desk clerks. Non-emergency call backs are generally defined as call backs relating to priority 3 and 4 calls, and those E, 1, and 2 calls when the incident has stabilized.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Basic Supervisor Responsibilities (612.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Deploy members by using a standard district numbering system, which allows deploying up to four cars per district for various activities, as follows (using district 620 as an example):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Air Support Unit Responsibilities (600.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each member of the ASU will be familiar with the Air Support Unit SOP (including any revisions). It is the responsibility of the Chief Pilot to maintain the SOP manual and ensure members of the unit are familiar with it.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Unit members paged with a flight request will respond within 10 minutes as to availability.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;A list of locations to be photographed will be maintained in the Bureau hangar. TFOs will review this list prior to each flight and photograph the locations if possible.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unit members will scan the precinct operation radio nets while airborne and assist in patrol calls when possible.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Flight requests made of an ASU member will be fulfilled unless there is a safety concern.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; ASU members will write a report when requested or when required by policy. A copy of all reports will be forwarded to the Chief Pilot, in addition to the end of flight reports completed by the pilot and TFO.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp; TOD will coordinate requests for ride-alongs during business hours. All ride-alongs are subject to the approval of the Chief Pilot. Bureau members are encouraged to participate in ride-alongs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Deployment (600.00)</strong></p>
<p>Aircraft may be deployed to provide patrol support, surveillance, enforcement and training. Life saving missions will receive priority. Additional services may include:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Specific enforcement of violations.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Surveillance of identified problem locations or people.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Aerial supervisory platform at disaster scenes.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp; The Bureau is dedicated to the principle that all community members are entitled to meaningful access to police services. The Bureau recognizes that language barriers can sometimes inhibit or even prohibit individuals from accessing and/or understanding important rights, obligations and services and from communicating accurately and efficiently in different situations.</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp; This policy establishes protocols for accessing interpreter services when necessary to ensure effective communication with community members who have special language needs due to hearing impairment or limited English proficiency.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; DIRECTIVE SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS</p>

<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In exigent circumstances, or while awaiting an interpreter, alternative communication methods (such as written notes) may be used. Use of alternative communication methods does not take the place of a qualified interpreter and such communications made using such alternative methods should be confirmed once an interpreter is available.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When special language needs are identified, members will inform community members that interpreter services are available free of charge.</p>
<p>4.4. &nbsp;Hearing impaired persons shall be provided access to a teletypewriter (TTY, also known as a telecommunications device for hearing impaired people, or TDD) in order to make a phone call in any situation in which a non-hearing impaired person would have access to a telephone . Members must also accept telephone calls placed by persons who are hard of hearing through the Telecommunications Relay Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">5.&nbsp; SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT PERSONS</p>

0600 - Field Operations,Field Operations,533205,0630.70 Mobile Audio Video Procedure,ARB-PPB-0630.70,0630.70,2,,2015-06-08 18:10:43 UTC,2015-06-08 17:26:00 UTC,A,,"<p><strong>630.70 Mobile Audio Video Procedure</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>The Portland Police Bureau equipped some marked patrol cars with a recording system called Mobile Audio and Video (MAV). The MAV is designed to assist and complement patrol officers in the performance of their duties. The MAV is used to record certain activities by providing a visual and/or audio record. Video recordings are intended to provide a visual/audio record of the incident and to supplement the officer's report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>The MAV system is designed to turn on automatically whenever the patrol car emergency lights are activated, patrol car speed reaches 80 MPH, or a detectable collision occurs. The MAV can also be manually activated by the officer. The system remains on until turned off manually.</p>
<p>When the MAV is activated, officers should, as soon as possible, advise all persons present they are being recorded in accordance with Oregon Revised Statutes 165.540(5)(b).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Required Activation of MAV (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>This policy is not intended to describe every possible situation where the system may be used. However, there are many situations where the use of the MAV system is appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition to the required situations, officers may activate the system any time he/she believes its use would be appropriate and/or valuable to document an incident. In some circumstances, it is not possible to capture images of the incident due to conditions or</p>
<p>location of the camera; however, the audio portion can be valuable evidence and is subject to the same activation requirements as the MAV.</p>
<p>The activation of the MAV system is required in any of the following situations:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; All field contacts involving actual or potential criminal conduct, within video or audio range, which includes:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Vehicular pursuits.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Suspicious vehicles.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Arrests.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Pedestrian checks.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; DUII investigations.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Consensual encounters.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Responding to an in-progress call.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Traffic enforcement.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Any call for service involving a crime where the recording may aid in the apprehension and/or prosecution of a suspect, such as:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Domestic violence calls.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Disturbance of peace calls.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Offenses involving violence or weapon.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Any other contact that becomes adversarial after the initial contact in a situation that would not otherwise require recording.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Any other circumstances where the officer believes that a recording of an incident would be appropriate.</p>
<p>Once the MAV system is activated, it shall remain on and shall not be turned off until the officer has cleared the scene of the incident or the transport is concluded. For purposes of this section, conclusion of an incident includes, but is not limited to, when all arrests have been made, arrestees have been transported, all interviews of citizens have been conducted, and all contact with the subject has ended. Audio and video recording may cease if an officer is simply waiting for tow truck or a family member to arrive or other similar situations or during the after action review process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When Activation Is Not Required (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>Activation of the MAV system is not required when exchanging information with other officers or during breaks, lunch periods, when not in service, or not actively on patrol.</p>
<p>Absent legal cause or lawful order, no member of this department may surreptitiously record any other member of this department without the express knowledge and consent of all parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Review of MAV Recordings (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>Recordings may be reviewed in any of the following situations:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; By a supervisor investigating a specific act of officer conduct.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; By an investigator or supervisor who is participating in an official investigation, such as a personnel complaint, administrative inquiry or a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; By bureau personnel who were on scene and either directly involved, or witnessed the incident, or with consent of the member, their collective bargaining representatives.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; By court personnel through proper process or with permission of the Chief of Police or his/her designee.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; By media personnel in accordance with current public records rules.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; Recordings may be shown for the purposes of training value. If an involved officer objects to the showing of recording, his/her objection will be submitted to the appropriate Branch Chief to determine if the training value outweighs the officer's objection for not showing the recording. All reasonable accommodations will be made to limit the impact of the incident on the member.</p>
<p>In no event shall any recording be released, used or shown for the purpose of ridicule or embarrassing any employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Documenting MAV Use (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>Any incident that was recorded with either the video or audio system shall be documented in the officer's report. If a citation was issued, a notation shall be placed on the back of the records copy of the citation that the incident was recorded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Video Media Storage and Integrity (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>Once checked in, all video media will be labeled and placed in a designated secure storage area. All video media that is not booked in as evidence will be retained for a minimum of six months after which time they may be erased, destroyed, or recycled.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Copies of Video Recordings (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>A copy of the original video recording will be made upon proper request for any person authorized in this directive.</p>
<p>Audio and video records may only be released in response to a valid court order, approved public record request, or upon approval by the Chief of Police or his/her designee. In the event that an original recording is released to court, a copy shall be made and placed in storage until the original is returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MAV Recordings As Evidence (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>MAV recordings shall remain on the video evidence server and copies can be produced upon request, as stated in this directive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Retention&nbsp;Of Recordings (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>MAV recordings shall be retained as follows:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Recordings used as evidence shall be retained until disposed of in accordance with the Release of Evidence protocol in the Property Procedures Policy.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Recordings used for internal investigations shall be retained in accordance with the Purging of Files protocol in the Personnel Files Policy.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; All other recordings shall be retained for a minimum of six months to ensure the recording is available in the event of litigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL (630.70)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sworn Officer Responsibilities (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>The officer shall test the MAV system by logging in with his/her name at the start of each shift. The officer shall also test the system at the end of his/her shift and log out of the system. If the system is malfunctioning, the officer shall take the vehicle out of service unless a supervisor requests the vehicle remain in service.</p>
<p>The MAV automatically stores the vehicle number, location, and time on each recording on the internal hard drive in the patrol car. When the patrol car reaches a wireless offload station, the video is automatically transferred to a server. In the event of a wireless offload failure, the officer will use the Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive attached to the MAV to offload the video.</p>

<p class=""WordSection1"">a.&nbsp; All officers shall successfully complete a Mobile Audio Video training course before being deployed in an operational setting.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">b.&nbsp; Prior to going into service, officers will ensure that all MAV equipment is working properly. If there are operating problems with any component of the system (video or audio) at any time prior to or during the shift, the system will not be used. The problem will be documented in the officer&rsquo;s notebook and/or MDC, and a supervisor notified. If the MAV is determined to be nonfunctional, a written service request shall include information on the suspected cause(s) of equipment failure, as available, and any recommendations for corrective action.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; When two or more MAV-equipped units respond to the same incident, all units should record the incident. The primary unit, as determined by the responding officers along with the disposition, will be responsible for appropriately documenting that the incident was recorded. Other responding MAV units will note on the MDC call history that they also recorded the incident.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Members are encouraged to narrate events, when practical using the audio recording and obtain video of crime scenes and recorded statements from suspects, victims and witnesses in accordance with the ORS.&nbsp; The video, however, is a supplement to and not a replacement for a written report.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; When an incident covered by DIR 1010.10, or a use of force review has been initiated under DIR 940.00 when force is used, and a review of that incident has begun, a supervisor will ensure the audio and video recordings are turned off. In addition to the termination of the audio and video recordings under these situations, members who were involved or witnessed these incidents will under most circumstances have the ability to view the audio and video recordings during their investigative or administrative interview.&nbsp; However, when an overriding investigative need exists, the Professional Standards Internal Investigation Unit or the Detective Division RU Manager or designee may preclude a member from viewing audio and/or video recordings of an incident, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Operation Protocols (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>For each recording, the member will select the category and will enter the case, incident, or citation number(s) for the incident after the recording has been terminated, or directly after the recording has been downloaded to the MAV Server.</p>
<p>Members:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Shall not delete, alter, reuse, modify or tamper with MAV recordings with the exception of the MAV technician pursuant to the provisions of this policy.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Shall not make copies of any recording for personal use, except for use in any criminal or disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; May review the recordings when preparing written reports, except during investigations involving the use of deadly force or in an in-custody death, where the officer was neither a witness nor directly involved in the incident.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Shall include copies for discovery when applicable.</p>
<p>When exporting MAV files to create copies to disc or other media, the member will note in the MAV Server application the reason for the video export. (i.e., evidence, traffic court, DMV hearing, media release, etc.)&nbsp; Disks created shall be marked with the case number, recording officer&rsquo;s name and DPSST number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supervisors' Responsibilities (630.70)</strong></p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">Supervisors will:</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">a.&nbsp; Ensure the division administrative supervisor is promptly notified when the supervisor reasonably believes that repairs are needed.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">b.&nbsp; Ensure the Training Division is notified when recordings contain material that the supervisor reasonably believes would assist in training.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">c.&nbsp; When an incident arises that requires the immediate retrieval of the audio and video recording a supervisor shall respond to the scene and ensure that the appropriate MAV technician, or other designee, removes the recorded media. The technician or designated person shall then:</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">1.&nbsp; Upload the recorded media to the MAV server; and</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">2.&nbsp; Make copies of the incident for investigative personnel.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">d.&nbsp; When an incident has concluded and a review of that incident has begun, a supervisor will ensure the audio and video recordings are turned off.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection1""><strong>Media Duplication (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp; All recordings are the property of the Portland Police Bureau. Dissemination outside of official Bureau business is prohibited without specific authorization from a supervisor.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Recorded media shall not be copied, viewed, or otherwise inserted into any device not approved by the Bureau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Public Records and Discovery Requests (630.70)</strong></p>
<p>Requests for copies or viewings will be referred to the Records Division. Fees will be charged in accordance with Appendix A.&nbsp; Requests for viewing a recorded &ldquo;crime&rdquo; and any companion &ldquo;violation&rdquo; tracking with the case will be referred to the district attorney&rsquo;s office. Requests for viewing a recorded &ldquo;violation&rdquo; will be conducted by the Records Division as follows:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Citizen requesting to view traffic &ldquo;violations&rdquo; will be facilitated by the MAV Technician.</p>

<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may seize or impound vehicles when doing so is lawful and consistent with the provisions of this directive. Members will comply with the procedures mandated by Portland City Code 14.C.10 and DIR. 650.00 Search, Seizures, and Inventories relating to inventory of persons, vehicles and property.

<p class=""WordSection1"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;AUTHORITY&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrant</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may seize a vehicle when a warrant to seize the vehicle exists.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Community Caretaking Guidelines</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may impound a vehicle under this section only when primarily motivated by the community caretaking issue presented by the vehicle rather than any punitive or investigative motivation.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not impound a vehicle under this section based solely on the arrest and/or issuance of a citation to the driver, owner or occupants; however, such circumstances may be relevant for other reasons such as the resulting inability of persons to lawfully operate or move the vehicle from its present location. Lack of insurance alone does not support a community caretaking impoundment.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should not impound a vehicle under this section if the owner or person in control of the vehicle consents to have a lawful driver, who is present at the scene, safely move the vehicle to a location that no longer presents a community caretaking issue. Members may wait for such a person to arrive, but are not required to if such person is not present at the time the officer requests tow service.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may impound a vehicle when the vehicle presents one or more of the following community caretaking issues:</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;PUBLIC SAFETY: The vehicle is an immediate danger to public safety. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicles the officer reasonably believes, based on the nature, condition and location of the vehicle, present an immediate danger to any person, including vehicles the officer reasonably believes contains explosives, toxic or dangerous chemicals, or substances that present an immediate danger to any person.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure</em><em>: </em>Members will issue a notice of impound and complete a tow report then request the vehicle towed to a private tow lot. An investigation report or parking citation is not required.</p>
<p class=""WordSection1"">4.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;HAZARD: The vehicle is impeding, or likely to impede, the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. This includes, but is not limited to, vehicles blocking a traffic or bicycle lane, private or public driveway, and vehicles impeding the normal flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic on streets, parking lots or other premises open to the public.</p>
<p>4.3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure: </em>Members will issue a notice of impound and complete a tow report then request the vehicle towed to a private tow lot. Members will issue a parking citation if required.</p>
<div class=""WordSection2"">
<p>4.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;SAFEKEEPING: The member has taken the driver of the vehicle into custody or caused a driver to stop driving the vehicle and it is reasonable under the circumstances to remove the vehicle from a public or exposed location for safekeeping to protect it, or its contents, from theft or damage, or to protect the City of Portland from liability related to the vehicle and contents.</p>
<p>4.3.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;This includes, but is not limited to, high-value vehicles or vehicles with high&shy; value contents; vehicles that cannot be secured due to the circumstances, location, design or condition of the vehicle; vehicles in locations that have an increased likelihood of theft or damage; vehicles in locations that increase the likelihood of damaging other property; and vehicles in locations that the member believes a person in control of a vehicle would not customarily leave the vehicle unattended for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>4.3.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure: </em>Members will issue a notice of impound and complete a tow report then request the vehicle be towed to a private lot. An investigation report or parking citation is not required.</p>
<p>4.3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;ILLEGALLY PARKED: The vehicle is illegally parked in a posted restricted space, zone, or traffic lane at any time and place where the vehicle is interfering or reasonably likely to interfere with the intended use of such a space, zone, or traffic lane; or the vehicle is illegally parked within 10 feet of a fire hydrant.</p>
<p>4.3.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure: </em>Members will complete an investigation report and parking citation and request the vehicle be towed to a private tow lot. A notice of impound is not required.</p>
<p>4.3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;ALARM DISTURBANCE: The vehicle is equipped with a vehicle alarm that is not designed to, or does not in fact, cease emitting an intermittent or constant sound after an aggregate time of 3 minutes within a 15 minute period on any public right-of-way; or in a public park and the alarm system disturbs or is likely to disturb, injure or endanger the peace, quiet, comfort, health or safety of the public or any person.</p>
<p>4.3.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure: </em>Members will issue a notice of impound and request the vehicle be towed to a private tow lot. An investigation report or parking citation is not required.</p>
<p>4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evidence of a Crime</p>
</div>
<p>4.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may seize a vehicle when the vehicle is on a premises open to the public, or an area that the officer has lawfully entered and it is immediately apparent to the member that the vehicle itself may be evidence as defined in ORS.133.535.</p>
<div class=""WordSection3"">
<p>4.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may seize a vehicle when the member has probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence as defined in ORS. 133.535, and exigent circumstances exist which make it reasonably necessary to seize the vehicle to preserve the evidence or protect it from being moved, tampered with or destroyed.</p>
<p>4.4.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedure: </em>If no exigent circumstances exist, the member should request to have one or more members standby with the vehicle until a warrant to seize the vehicle can be obtained. If exigent circumstances arise while the warrant is being obtained, including but not limited to persons attempting to access the vehicle, members may deny access or seize the vehicle as evidence. Members seizing the vehicle will request the vehicle be towed to Rivergate Storage and place a formal hold on the vehicle. The members will immediately notify the appropriate detective or sergeant of the hold.</p>
<p>4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stolen Vehicles (in accordance with DIR 630.61)</p>
<p>4.5.1.&nbsp; A member may impound a vehicle when the member reasonably believes the vehicle is stolen.</p>
<p>4.5.1.1.&nbsp; <em>Procedure: </em>Members will call Auto Records to place a temporary hold on the vehicle for precinct detectives and record the DPPST number of the records clerk notified. Members will also notify his/her precinct detective sergeant of the hold and request the vehicle is towed to a private tow lot.</p>
<p>4.5.2.&nbsp; A member may impound a vehicle when the VIN has been verified to indicate the vehicle is in stolen status.</p>
<p>4.5.2.1.&nbsp; <em>Procedure: </em>If the owner is available, members may wait a reasonable period of time for the owner to arrive on scene. If the owner is on scene and provides the member with contact information, proof of ownership and signature, the member should release the vehicle to the owner. Otherwise, the member will request the vehicle be towed to a private tow lot. Members will immediately notify Auto Records that the vehicle is no longer in stolen status, and transmit notification via the MDC that the vehicle is no longer in stolen status and is possession of the owner, so that other members are aware of the recovery.</p>
<p>4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned Vehicles</p>

</div>
<p>5.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;To file a complaint for late arrival or other reason, members should complete a Special Report documenting the facts.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"">5.3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will write ""TOW"" on the face of the parking tag, if applicable.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"">5.3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members required to wait for a towing operator will ensure the operator that arrives is from the company dispatched. Exceptions to this rule are when immediate action is required to protect life or property.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"">5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;When circumstances allow for a vehicle to be left at the scene, members will make reasonable efforts to secure the vehicle and ensure those efforts are documented in an appropriate police report.

<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. In furtherance of community engagement principles, the Portland Police Bureau endeavors to build and foster relationships with private property owners and managers for the purpose of keeping Portland&rsquo;s businesses and neighborhoods safe and productive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Through the Police Bureau&rsquo;s Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program, Bureau members will partner with private property owners and property managers to enforce trespass laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Administration:</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1. Through the Police Bureau&rsquo;s Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program, Bureau members partner with eligible private property owners or property managers to enforce trespass law on the respective private property when no responsible party is on location.</p>
<p>1.2. Members should refer interested participants to the Portland Police Bureau website and/or the Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator for more information, application materials, and application submittal.</p>
<p>1.3. The Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will receive applications from private property owners or managers, ensuring applications are both complete and comply with Program requirements.</p>
<p>1.3.1. For example, complete applications must reflect a physical address. To comply with Program requirements, a property must be zoned or used properly. Properties that are not Program-eligible include:</p>
<p>1.3.1.1. Businesses in operation twenty-four (24) hours or with security on scene,</p>
<p>1.3.1.2. Multifamily housing units,</p>
<p>1.3.1.3. Mixed-use developments,</p>
<p>1.3.1.4. Single family residence,</p>
<p>1.3.1.5. Public property, or</p>
<p>1.3.1.6. Property outside the Police Bureau&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>1.3.2. Questions about an application or exceptions to Program requirements may be vetted with the applicable precinct&rsquo;s Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant, who will process Program matters through the chain of command as necessary.</p>
<p>1.3.3. The Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will assign the screened application to an applicable precinct&rsquo;s Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant.</p>
<p>1.4. Upon receipt, the precinct Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant, will review the application and exercise discretion in assigning Bureau resources for follow up.</p>
<p>1.4.1. When appropriate, an applicable precinct&rsquo;s Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant, or designee, will meet in person and on location with the requesting property owner or manager to discuss mutual responsibilities under the Agreement, survey the property, identify where trespass notice placards should be posted and maintained, and provide official notice placards.</p>
<p>1.5. The applicable precinct&rsquo;s Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant, or designee, will document in an appropriate police report the date and time of the Agreement and the name and contact information of the owner/manager in charge, enabling the property to be searchable for fieldwork and prosecution purposes.</p>
<p>1.6. The applicable precinct&rsquo;s Neighborhood Response Team Sergeant will review and approve all Agreements before applications are returned to the Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator.</p>
<p>1.7. Upon approval, the Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will issue formal, written notice to the private property owner or manager, confirming the Trespass Enforcement Agreement has been approved and is active.</p>
<p>1.8. The Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will continue serve as the administrative point of contact for private property owners or managers, should their Agreement circumstances change (e.g. change of property ownership given Agreements are non-transferrable). Additionally, the Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will notify the private property owners or managers of the need to renew their Agreement with the Police Bureau, in anticipation of the Agreement&rsquo;s expiration date (2 years). Finally, the Trespass Enforcement Agreement Program Coordinator will notify private property owners or manager if the Agreement is revoked for failure to comply with terms (e.g. unreported ownership transfer, failure to renew, etc.) and collect any official notice placards previously allocated.</p>
<p>2. Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>2.1. When taking action under authority of a Trespass Enforcement Agreement, members will confirm the Agreement is current and that proper notice has been given before taking police action on private property.&nbsp; Members may query the property&rsquo;s address in the computer aided dispatch system (VCAD) for a flag record number, before accessing the property&rsquo;s history in the Records Management System (RMS). &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2. Members shall avoid exercising authority under a Trespass Enforcement Agreement where an official notice placard is not displayed, unless the person in charge can be verified and contacted by telephone.&nbsp; This does not preclude members from taking police action that would be appropriate without the existence of a Trespass Enforcement Agreement.</p>
<p>2.3. Persons found on private property covered by a Trespass Enforcement Agreement without authorization will be told to leave the property and not return or be subject to arrest for Criminal Trespass in the Second Degree, or other applicable offenses.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong><em></em></p>
<ol>
<li>The Police Bureau recognizes the use of informants is essential in many types of investigations. The Bureau recognizes the need for flexibility in using informants, as well as the potential for harm and abuse. To minimize the potential for abuse, the Bureau recognizes that close adherence to procedures by investigators and supervisors are necessary. In the interest of maintaining consistency and the highest levels of accountability within the informant program, the Drugs and Vice Division Manager will exercise approval authority for all Bureau informants.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Members using informants will maintain a professional relationship with the informant in accordance with Directive 310.00, Conduct, Professional, and will do so with knowledge and approval of the command of the unit to which they are assigned. Procedures will ensure maximum benefit in the use and handling of this type of information source while minimizing risk of abuse.</p>
<p>3. Members obtaining information from informants, or other such sources, will use that information for law enforcement purposes in accordance with existing statutes, case law and Bureau procedures.</p>
<p>4. Members paying and using informants for case development purposes and members who supervise and manage the Informant Program, must receive Bureau approved training before taking such action. The Drugs and Vice Division will be responsible for such training and the Training Division will maintain a list of Bureau members who have completed the training.</p>
<p>5. Members will control the activities of informants and use informants with a clear investigative goal. Informants are to be used as a means to an end. They are not partners in the investigative process.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Member Responsibilities:</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following rules apply to the member-informant relationship:</p>
<p>1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Reliable Informants (CRIs) will be considered Bureau informants. Members will not engage in actions which would prevent Confidential Reliable Informants from working with other members. Supervisors of different units using the same Confidential Reliable Informants will confer at least monthly and more frequently as needed to assess investigator control and Confidential Reliable Informant performance.</p>
<p>1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not engage in personal or social relationships with Confidential Reliable Informants, and will not engage in sexual relationships with Confidential Reliable Informants.</p>
<p>1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not engage in business relationships with Confidential Reliable Informants.</p>
<p>1.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should not accept gifts or gratuities from a Confidential Reliable Informant. In the event this is unavoidable, the member will document the circumstances and place the gift or gratuity in the Property Room.</p>
<p>1.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should keep officer safety strategies in mind in dealing with Confidential Reliable Informants. Members should not meet Confidential Reliable Informants alone. Exceptions may be authorized by a supervisor, based on tactical considerations.</p>
<p>1.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments made to Confidential Reliable Informants will be in accordance with Directive 660.30, Evidence Funds Use, and Directive 660.32, Agent/Informant Processing. Members will complete the Evidence Fund Accounting Receipt (EFAR) and have the Confidential Reliable Informants sign the receipt when payment is made.</p>
<p>1.1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any action taken on behalf of a Confidential Reliable Informants, other than payments (e.g., testifying on behalf of the Confidential Reliable Informants, obtaining case consideration from other members, interceding with a parole/probation officer on behalf of the Confidential Reliable Informant, etc.) shall be documented in an inter-office memorandum through proper channels and placed in the Confidential Reliable Informants true name file.</p>
<p>1.1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should maintain strict confidentiality on Confidential Reliable Informants identities. The Drugs and Vice Division will coordinate the release of a Confidential Reliable Informant&rsquo;s identity after obtaining the approval of the Drugs and Vice Division Manager.</p>
<p>2. Reliability of Confidential Reliable Informants:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintaining the credibility and manageability of Confidential Reliable Informants is fundamental to the effectiveness of the informant system. Members are swearing to the credibility of the Confidential Reliable Informants when using them for probable cause.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who utilize a Confidential Reliable Informant during a calendar month and account for the use with an Evidence Fund Accounting Receipt (EFAR) or in conjunction with a formal cooperating agreement will conduct a RegJIN records check of the Confidential Reliable Informant&rsquo;s true name to determine if the Confidential Reliable Informant has had any recent contacts with law enforcement that have not been reported to the member. These RegJIN records checks will be conducted when the member completes their monthly Evidence Fund Expense Report (EFER) in accordance with Directive 660.30, Evidence Funds Use. Confidential Reliable Informant&rsquo;s found to have unreported contacts with law enforcement will be investigated regarding their credibility and manageability. Members will immediately report such instances involving their Confidential Reliable Informant to a supervisor.</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors are responsible for the ongoing review of Confidential Reliable Informant reliability and productivity. Confidential Reliable Informants who do not produce, and/or are not found to be reliable, will not be used. Supervisors of different units using the same Confidential Reliable Informants will confer at least monthly and more frequently as needed to assess investigator control and Confidential Reliable Informant performance.</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Confidential Reliable Informants who are non-credible and/or unmanageable have the potential for undermining the effectiveness of the entire system. Confidential Reliable Informants who are not manageable or credible will immediately be classified as unreliable and not used. When members become aware of incidents of unmanageability or non-credibility, the member will immediately notify a supervisor to institute a supervisor review, and the member will document in a memorandum to the supervisor a description of the incidents which questions the manageability or non-credibility of the Confidential Reliable Informant. Until a determination has been made by a supervisor, the Confidential Reliable Informant will not be used by any member. The following actions/activities on the part of a Confidential Reliable Informant will be the basis for instituting supervisory review:</p>
<p>2.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Untruthfulness on significant issues, especially related to an investigation.</p>
<p>2.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the same case to different units or agencies with the purpose of obtaining a better pay off (case shopping).</p>
<p>2.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engaging in criminal behavior.</p>
<p>2.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Failing to maintain contact with the case member or being repeatedly uncontrollable.</p>
<p>2.4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chronic intoxication or appearing to be under the influence of any drug.</p>
<p>2.4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theft of evidence money or withholding drugs from an evidence buy.</p>
<p>2.4.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using his/her position for personal gain or identifying themselves as a police officer.</p>
<p>2.4.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violating a provision of the liability waiver or any Confidential Reliable Informant contract.</p>
<p>2.4.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other act which seriously impairs the Confidential Reliable Informant&rsquo;s credibility or manageability.</p>
<p>2.4.10.&nbsp; Chronically non-performing (e.g., buys bunk (counterfeit drugs) or is unable to buy drugs).</p>
<p>3. Problem Informants:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision to classify a Confidential Reliable Informant as unreliable will rest with the Responsibility Unit Manager after reviewing the supervisor review documentation on the Confidential Reliable Informant in question.</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the decision has been made to declare a Confidential Reliable Informant as unreliable, the Responsibility Unit Manager will ensure that:</p>
<p>3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Problem Informant Report is completed.</p>
<p>3.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The original Problem Informant Report along with the informant&rsquo;s original true name and moniker file will be transferred to Drugs and Vice Division for inclusion in the master Drugs and Vice Division problem informant file.</p>
<p>3.2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Drugs and Vice Division will be responsible for distributing the problem informant list of all Bureau problem informants to all Responsibility Units using informants. The Drugs and Vice Division will justify and distribute the master problem informant list each July and January. The Drugs and Vice Division will distribute information regarding individual problem informants as they occur between July and January, so that Responsibility Units using informants have an accurate problem informant listing at all times.</p>
<p>3.2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copies of any files may be destroyed after the problem Confidential Reliable Informant&rsquo;s name appears on the Drugs and Vice Divisions Problem Informant List since the Drugs and Vice Division maintains this documentation.</p>
<p>4. Problem Informant Files:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; All divisions and precincts using informants will maintain a confidential problem informant file containing the most current Drugs and Vice Division issued Problem Informant List. Copies of all Problem Informant Reports not yet reflected on the Drugs and Vice Division Problem Informant List will be filed alphabetically by true name in this file. Prior to approving a new Confidential Reliable Informant, the Drugs and Vice Division Problem Informant File and list will be checked by the control officer/investigator to determine if the individual has been a problem informant. If so, approval for informant use rests with the Drugs and Vice Division Manager.</p>
<p>5. Juvenile Informants:</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of a juvenile informant should be made on a case by case basis as a last resort, with an investigative tactical plan describing how the juvenile will be used and documentation of why the investigation is so critical that a juvenile should be used.</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of a juvenile informant for a criminal investigation needs the review and approval of the Responsibility Unit Manager and the prosecuting District Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Parent/guardian&rsquo;s permission for the juvenile to act as an informant is required, unless the criminal investigation is so important that the Responsibility Unit Manager and the prosecuting District Attorney&rsquo;s Officer are in agreement that it is not needed in a specific case, because requesting permission would jeopardize the critical investigation.</p>
<p>6. Informant Contracts:</p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oftentimes, Confidential Reliable Informants work for case consideration instead of pay. In the event a Confidential Reliable Informant has been officially charged with a crime, an informant contract will be drafted and an agreement will be entered into by the member, a deputy district attorney, or assistant U.S. attorney and the Confidential Reliable Informant. The following procedures will apply to informant contracts:</p>
<p>6.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An informant contract must be specific in the following areas:</p>
<p>6.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work to be completed by the Confidential Reliable Informant. The details will vary, but the intent is to be specific (e.g., number of cases to be done, and the type and size of each).</p>
<p>6.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duration of the contract and/or the possibility of time extensions.</p>
<p>6.1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the actual case considerations will entail.</p>
<p>6.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contract must include the name of the deputy district attorney or assistant U.S. attorney approving the contract.</p>
<p>6.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contract is to specify the member who will determine whether the terms of the contract are fulfilled or not.</p>
<p>6.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member identified in the contract as being responsible for the determination of completion of the terms will submit a memorandum documenting that determination and closing the contract. This memorandum is to be filed with the original contract.</p>
<p>6.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event the contract timeline is extended, or some specifics are renegotiated or further clarified, these changes and the fact that all of the parties to the original contract agree, is to be documented in a memorandum and filed with the original contract.</p>
<p>6.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Informant contracts must be preapproved by a supervisor and a deputy district attorney or assisting U.S. attorney and signed by the Confidential Reliable Informant only after the contract, the Confidential Reliable Informant packet and Confidential Reliable Informant are approved by the Drugs and Vice Division Manager.</p>

<p><strong>Policy: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The member/investigator is the primary user for all evidence funds available in the Police Bureau. As such, the member/investigator must maintain strict integrity in accounting for evidence funds (monies used to obtain evidence and/or information in the investigation of a crime). Ongoing consistent supervision of members and agent/informants (an individual working for a member in an undercover status) who disburse, use or receive evidence and informant funds is the critical factor in ensuring integrity and accountability. Supervision and responsibility begin at the member/investigator level, and continue throughout the chain of command.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Funds may be used for the following purposes:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Paying agents/informants for information.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchasing items that will be used as evidence, develop suspects, further an investigation or lead to an arrest.</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out-of-pocket, job-related expenses incurred when conducting an investigation.</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Out-of-town investigations that will not be reimbursed by the state or the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rental of a vehicle or other equipment for a limited period of time.</p>
<p>3. Funds may be used for the following only with approval from a Responsibility Unit Manager.</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Disbursement to an informant or undercover operative in the form of a monthly retainer.</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase of legitimate property on the open market for resale in furtherance of an investigation.</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Procurement of evidence, information, or recovery of property from crimes committed in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sending members to schools or seminars when reimbursement is fully expected. Authorization will be strictly limited.</p>
<p>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide lodging, meals, and/or travel expenses for victims or witnesses if the cost will not be reimbursed by city, state or other sources. (The victim or witness must be needed to further an investigation, or his/her safety must be in immediate jeopardy because of assistance to the Bureau, which makes it necessary to provide temporary support pending disposition of the investigation.)</p>
<p>4. Funds may not be used for:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchasing miscellaneous equipment for a Responsibility Unit or members even though the intent is to use it for an investigation.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel and living expenses not directly related to a case under investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Obtaining Evidence Funds (Responsibility Unit Level):</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsibility Unit Managers (or designees) are authorized to make evidence fund draws against City Evidence and Information Funds and/or other funds which may become available from federal, state, or other sources.</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual cash fund draws will be made through the Fiscal Services Division. These draws require authorization from the Chief of Police or applicable Assistant Chief.</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsibility Units not having evidence funds available may receive funds from another Responsibility Unit, as outlined in this Directive.</p>
<p>2. Funds: Security and Access:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; All funds will be secured in a cash box within the locked Responsibility Unit safe. A separate cash box will be used for each fund if there is more than one source available.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Access will be controlled by the Responsibility Unit Manager who may designate key members who are authorized to issue and turn in funds. These individuals will also have access to the Agent/Informant Moniker file. A current list of key members will be maintained by each Responsibility Unit in their administrative files.</p>
<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchasing commodities (e.g. Bitcoin, precious metals, etc.) in order to develop suspects or further an investigation. The purchase of commodities of any kind with evidence funds requires the written approval of the appropriate Assistant Chief and the direct involvement of the Drugs and Vice Division, in order to create evidence fund accounting mechanisms for the operational use of such commodities.</p>
<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe combinations will be changed when the Responsibility Unit Manager or key members are transferred from the Responsibility Unit.</p>
<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expenditures will be authorized by the Responsibility Unit Manager or designee, before funds are distributed. The funds are to be used for criminal investigation with expenditures verified by documentation, receipts (where possible), and monthly Evidence Fund Expense Reports (EFERs).</p>
<p>3. Disbursal of Funds:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A supervisor assigned to or responsible for the Responsibility Unit considering disbursal of funds will review the request for funds prior to disbursal using the following criteria:</p>

<p>3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability/effectiveness of informant (if one is involved).</p>
<p>3.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legality of the operation (basis for search warrant, evidence buy, etc.).</p>
<p>3.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amount of funds requested.</p>
<p>3.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Projected return on investment.</p>

<p>3.2.2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Item #5 (Balance): The fund balance after the transaction.</p>
<p>3.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before a member signs for receipt of funds, both the member and the issuer are responsible for ensuring all information regarding the transaction is correct and the transaction is properly recorded in the member&rsquo;s EFER.</p>

<p>3.7.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a supervisor agrees funds are necessary, the supervisor will contact the Responsibility Unit having available funds or responsibility for the crime/investigation, which is being pursued, and request the funds.</p>
<p>3.7.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A supervisor of the disbursing Responsibility Unit will evaluate the request and disburse the funds within the guidelines of this directive and any applicable Responsibility Unit Standard Operating Procedure.</p>
<p>3.7.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members of all units and outside agencies that receive funds will be required to account for those funds at the end of the month.</p>
<p>3.7.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An EFER book will also be issued when funds are disbursed to a unit or outside agency that does not have evidence funds. The individual expending the evidence funds will be responsible for completing the report and returning it to the issuing Responsibility Unit by the end of the month or explain the carryover by memorandum.</p>
<p>3.7.1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All loans to Responsibility Units or outside agencies are to be strictly limited. All reimbursements and loans will be accompanied by the Loan Receipt Form. The Responsibility Unit or outside agency receiving the loan will be responsible for completing an EFER, and will include the Loan Receipt Form.</p>
<p>3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unexpected return of funds:</p>
<p>3.8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an unexpected return of funds occurs (e.g. from a defendant by court order, insurance company, other police agency, etc.) and the funds were written off in a prior month, the return will be treated as new funds, and processed as follows:</p>
<p>3.8.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A check will be made out to the City of Portland, Bureau of Police, with the name of the Responsibility Unit and the name of the evidence fund on the memo line.</p>
<p>3.8.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The member receiving the check will write an inter-office memo to the Responsibility Unit Manager detailing who the check is from, amount, reason for return, case number(s), subject(s) involved in the case and any other pertinent information.</p>
<p>3.8.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two copies of all documents will be obtained. The first copy set and the check will be delivered to Fiscal for deposit to the General Fund. The second copy set will be retained in the Responsibility Unit files.</p>
<p>3.8.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exception: Funds expended on an investigation that will be reimbursed&nbsp;by&nbsp;another&nbsp;agency (e.g.,&nbsp;Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)/Homeland Security Investigations (HIS)/Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)) will be treated as an expected return and will go directly to the Responsibility Unit&rsquo;s evidence fund.</p>
<p>3.8.1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: DEA/HSI/FBI agrees to fund up to $5,000 for a narcotic investigation that Drugs and Vice Division (DVD) is running. DVD expends money from their evidence fund for the case and then submits a bill to DEA/HSI/FBI for reimbursement. The money from DEA/HSI/FBI is then added to DVD&rsquo;s evidence fund as an Expected Return. A memo is added to the monthly accounting packet detailing the transaction.</p>
<p>3.8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an unexpected return of evidence funds occurs from an agent/ informant who, for any reason, did not use the funds as expected, the member receiving the money will complete an inter-office memo detailing who the money is from, the amount, the reason for the return, case number(s) involved, subject(s) involved in the case, and any other pertinent information. Funds recovered from defendants will be processed as evidence. The memo and funds will be delivered to the Responsibility Unit accountant, who will add the money back to the evidence fund and record the return to the Credits column of the Master Balance Ledger. The Responsibility Unit accountant will also attach a copy of the interoffice memorandum to the accounting packet behind the Responsibility Unit draw receipts.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The purpose of this Directive is to provide guidance for demonstrations, special events, the managing of crowds during demonstrations, and controlling crowds during civil disturbances.</li>
<li>Freedom of speech, association, assembly, and the right to petition the government are subject to reasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of expression; the content of the speech does not provide the basis for imposing limitations on First Amendment rights.</li>
<li>The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that the City of Portland has a tradition of free speech and assembly. &nbsp;It is the responsibility and priority of the Portland Police Bureau not to unduly impede the exercise of First Amendment rights and to provide for the safe and lawful expression of speech, while also maintaining the public safety, peace and order. &nbsp;A police response that impedes otherwise protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest.&nbsp;</li>
<li>While the First Amendment provides broad protections for the expression of speech, it does not provide protection for criminal acts including, but not limited to, riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threats to public safety, peace or order.</li>
<li>The Bureau recognizes that demonstrations and events are dynamic in nature.&nbsp; Accordingly, members will monitor the crowd throughout the event to assess the level of risk posed to both demonstrators and the public at large, with the goal of minimizing potential violence, injury or damage to property.&nbsp; Member response should be commensurate to overall crowd behavior, and members should differentiate between groups or individuals who are engaging in criminal behavior or otherwise posing a threat to the safety of others and those in the crowd who are lawfully demonstrating.&nbsp; Members will strive to maintain a diplomatic presence<em> </em>to dissuade participants from engaging in civil disturbance and to encourage crowd self-monitoring.</li>
<li>If a demonstration becomes a civil disturbance, the Bureau has a responsibility to reasonably protect public safety and restore peace and order.&nbsp; The preferred police response is one of crowd management rather than crowd control.&nbsp; The Bureau should employ only objectively reasonable crowd management and/or crowd control tactics with the intent to de-escalate the situation.&nbsp; If there is an escalation to a civil disturbance that is no longer isolated to individuals or small groups, members shall adjust their tactical response to adequately resolve the incident in an attempt to restore safety, peace and order.</li>
<li>All members are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner when interacting with persons involved with demonstrations and special events. &nbsp;Members shall identify themselves by wearing a visible name badge or identification number at all times. &nbsp;A member&rsquo;s communication with members of the crowd will remain content neutral.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedure: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, governs all uses of force, including in crowd management and crowd control situations.</p>
<p>2. The Bureau shall use the national, standardized and exhaustive system established in the Incident Command System (ICS) to plan and manage significant incidents and events.&nbsp; Members shall refer to Directive 700.00, National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS), for specific guidance regarding incident management.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1. When time and circumstances permit and a police response is reasonably anticipated, the IC shall develop an Incident Action Plan (IAP) prior to the start of an incident or event.</p>
<p>3. Communication.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1. The Bureau&rsquo;s goals are to facilitate participants&rsquo; lawful objectives and protect their right to assemble.&nbsp; Furthermore, where event participants comply with City laws and ordinances, the Bureau shall encourage and support participants&rsquo; efforts to monitor themselves in an attempt to limit member involvement.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1. When a police response is requested or deemed necessary by the Bureau:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.1. The Bureau shall make reasonable efforts to contact and engage in dialogue with known event or demonstration organizers to assist the Bureau in its planning and to develop a shared understanding of the organizers&rsquo; needs and objectives. &nbsp;Similarly, the Bureau should communicate its expectations and inform participants on permissible and restricted actions during the event or demonstration.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.2. The Bureau, through the PPB Demonstration Liaison or another designee, shall attempt to maintain communication with known event or demonstration organizers or the Person(s)-In-Charge before and during the event. &nbsp;The Liaison shall maintain communications with the IC to keep them apprised of the situation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.3. The Bureau, through the Public Information Officer (PIO) or another designee, shall communicate through the use of social media and other conventional outlets to keep the public, including the crowd, informed throughout the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2. When appropriate, members should engage and interact with the crowd in a positive and non-confrontational manner.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.1.1. Where the Bureau learns of an event at least twenty-four hours prior to its commencement, the Assistant Chief of Operations and the precinct commander nearest to the event location shall determine if the event should be staffed using the precinct&rsquo;s resources or city-wide Bureau resources.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.1. Events that are small in crowd size, or for which credible information indicates that there is little concern of civil disturbance, shall generally be managed at the precinct level and staffed by the shift supervisor, who shall serve as the IC.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">4.1.1.1.1. If crowd behavior escalates to a level that poses a threat to public safety, peace or order during an event that is being managed by a shift supervisor acting as the IC, the shift supervisor must consult with a CMIC who will then determine if they (the CMIC) should assume command and request additional resources.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.1.1.2. Events that are anticipated to have a greater critical impact, require a significant police response, and/or have the potential to become a civil disturbance shall have a CMIC designated by the Assistant Chief of Operations as the IC.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">4.1.3.2.1. If a shift supervisor is staffing an event as the IC, they shall consult with a CMIC prior to activating RRT.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">4.1.3.2.2. Activation of Mass Arrest requires the CMIC to notify the Detective Division to ensure mass-arrest resources are available.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2. Spontaneous Demonstrations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.2.1. Events that the Bureau learns of with less than twenty-four hours before the start of the event are deemed spontaneous.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.2.2. Many spontaneous events can be lawful and facilitated with appropriate police assistance.&nbsp; A spontaneous or non-permitted event is not necessarily unlawful, nor does it automatically require a significant police response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.2.3. A supervisor at the precinct of occurrence shall respond to the event and determine if a police response is warranted.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.2.3.1. If a police response is warranted, the on-scene supervisor shall serve as the IC for the incident and attempt to engage the event or demonstration organizer in an effort to facilitate participants&rsquo; lawful objectives and protect their right to assemble.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">4.2.3.1.1. A Sergeant who is the first supervisor on scene of a spontaneous demonstration shall notify their Lieutenant, who may then respond to the scene and assume command.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.2.3.2. The on-scene supervisor (IC) may contact an RRT supervisor, the RRT commander or a CMIC to help determine an appropriate level of response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">4.2.3.2.1. After consultation, if a higher level of police response is deemed necessary, a CMIC shall be called in and assume command.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">4.2.3.3. If crowd behavior during the event escalates to a level that poses a threat to public safety, peace or order during an event that is being managed by a shift supervisor, the shift supervisor must consult with a CMIC, who will then determine if they (the CMIC) should assume command.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3. Demonstrations may be broadcast to Bureau facilities by live video feed to provide situational awareness to the IC.&nbsp; In accordance with ORS &sect; 181A.250, the broadcast will not be recorded unless and until a member has reasonable suspicion that a crime is being committed, at which time the member will communicate this information up the chain of command to the IC, who will make the decision whether to authorize recording to commence.&nbsp; If a possible crime is captured on the recording, that recording will be forwarded to Bureau&rsquo;s Detective Division for investigation and the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office, if requested. &nbsp;A copy will also be furnished to the City Attorney&rsquo;s office for the purpose of evaluating civil liability based on crimes charged or arrests made.&nbsp; Pursuant to Oregon Administrative Rules regarding records retention, recordings that do not have evidentiary value or aid in internal investigations shall only be retained by the City Attorney&rsquo;s office for thirty days.&nbsp; The Bureau will not keep a copy of any videos recorded under this Directive, and the IC will not authorize recording for the purposes of monitoring individuals or groups based solely on political&nbsp;associations or religious or social views.</p>
<p>5. Police Response to Demonstrations and Special Events.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1. Prior to a demonstration or event, the IC shall make a determination regarding the appropriate level of police response and the necessary allocation of resources to manage an event.&nbsp; Depending on the potential impact of the crowd (e.g., size, interference with commerce, street and pedestrian traffic, etc.), the Bureau may not need to be involved in the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2. The priority of the Bureau is to allow demonstration and event participants to self-police and manage their own events.&nbsp; To that end the IC shall monitor the event, weighing the totality of the circumstances to inform the decision to introduce police action to maintain public safety, peace and order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.2.1. When deciding whether to use certain police tactics within a crowd, the IC shall balance the benefits of such action(s) to maintain public safety, peace and order against the impact on the demonstration or event participants&rsquo; First Amendment rights.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.2.2. The IC, or a designee, shall authorize the appropriate level of protective equipment based on several factors to include, but not limited to:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.2.3. When practicable, the IC should attempt to position members in protective gear in locations that minimize visibility until deployment is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3. &nbsp;If crowd behavior presents a clear and present danger that threatens the public safety, peace or order, and the event can no longer be effectively managed through a minimal police presence, the IC may adjust crowd tactics to adequately respond.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.1. When police action is necessary, members should endeavor to distinguish between individuals engaged in criminal behavior and demonstration or event participants who are peacefully and lawfully demonstrating.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.3.1.1. The Bureau&rsquo;s assigned Demonstration Liaison, another IC-designated member and/or the member operating the sound truck shall, when feasible, attempt to convey the police action to the crowd via announcements and warnings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>11. Detentions.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">11.1.

<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. The Drugs and Vice Division (DVD) has the responsibility for maintaining accurate information regarding the status of informants used by the Police Bureau. &nbsp;In the interest of consistency and to ensure the appropriate vetting of informants necessary to maintain the integrity of the program the DVD Manager or sworn designee will approve all Police Bureau informants prior to use. &nbsp;Anyone working as an informant for a member will be processed in the following manner before funds may be disbursed.<strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Informant File Checklist:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. The Checklist will be completed by the member processing the informant prior to submitting the informant package to their supervisor for approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2. The informant file will contain as a minimum:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1. Informant Profile Sheet.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2. Informant Moniker Exemplar.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.3. Informant Information/Background Report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.4. Informant Liability Waiver.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.5. Informant Packet Checklist.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.6. Computerized Criminal History (CCH) and RegJIN printout.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3. All forms will be filled out completely. If an item does not apply, indicate not applicable (N/A) in the appropriate place.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4. The entire informant file will be maintained by the originating Responsibility Unit (RU) as an active file.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1. When an informant has not been utilized for a period of one (1) year, the file will be designated as inactive.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.2. To maintain accurate informant status when an informant is designated as inactive the informant&rsquo;s file will be transferred to DVD for inclusion in the master DVD inactive informant file.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.3. The file will be maintained by DVD and will be subject to purging in accordance with state records retention laws, unless the informant is re-activated by a member prior to the purge date.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.4. Members may re-activate an informant by submitting a newly completed informant packet with a new Informant File Checklist including CCH and RegJIN updates.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.5. The immediate use and payment of an inactive informant is not precluded, as long as the informant file is updated during the calendar month in which the re-activation occurs.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.6. Inactive informant files will be purged after a period of five (5) years.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5. The informant file is accessible only to the RU Manager or designees, and supervisors when evidence funds are audited. All requests to view any informant files by outside parties (e.g., a judge or deputy district attorney [DA]) will be forwarded to the DVD Manager for response in order to ensure program consistency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Informant Profile (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1. A profile will be completed on each informant receiving or using evidence funds, formalized case consideration or is otherwise under the direction of a member actively working on a criminal investigation. &nbsp;Cooperating witnesses, who provide immediate and case specific information to members during an initial criminal investigation, are not subject to this requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2. A code name will be assigned to the informant by the initiating member. &nbsp;The code name will be an alias; true names will not be used. &nbsp;The code name will include full first, middle and last names, and will be used in all record keeping and receipt transactions involving the informant.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3. The informant must be present when the form is completed and will be required to sign their true name, full code name, and affix the right-hand, index fingerprint on the bottom of the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4. A current photograph and copies of the informant&rsquo;s criminal history, if any, will be attached to the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5. Reliable identification must be obtained in the event the informant has no record.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Informant Liability Waiver (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1. The waiver must be read by the informant, completed and signed. &nbsp;Each item must be initialed by the informant and witnessed by a supervisor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2. The waiver is to be retained and solely accessed by the RU Manager in a locked file cabinet, separate from the Informant Moniker and Reliability form. &nbsp;Any changes in information or documentation regarding an informant will be relayed to the RU Manager immediately for accurate maintenance of the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Informant Moniker and Reliability (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1. This document will be completed on all informants receiving or using evidence funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2. A supervisory sergeant or above will be responsible for completing the form and setting up the Informant Moniker and Productivity File.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3. The informant must sign the exemplar section (three signatures), which will be witnessed by a supervisor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.4. All documentation dealing with the informant&rsquo;s reliability will be maintained in this file. This includes Part I, the white copy of the Evidence Fund Accounting Receipt (EFAR), which contains information on the informant&rsquo;s productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.5. The RU Manager, or their sworn designee, is responsible for maintaining the file up-to-date, checking informant signatures against exemplars, and filing agent/informant receipts.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.6. Each time a supervisor checks the file; they will initial and date the Supervisor&rsquo;s Review Section of the form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Informant Information/Background Report (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1. This report contains information useful in deciding whether or not to use the informant, and will be completed in conjunction with the Informant Profile form. &nbsp;Supervisors and managers from each Responsibility Unit employing informants will review the entire informant file before delivering the file to a DVD supervisor. &nbsp;DVD supervisors will review the file to ensure that they are completed in a manner that is consistent with the appropriate vetting of informants necessary to maintain the integrity of the program before forwarding the file to the DVD Manager for final review.&nbsp; If an informant has been arrested for or convicted of violent person felony crimes, sex offenses, or has other criminal history that would tend to greatly undermine public confidence in the informant program, the DVD supervisor will review the informant file with the appropriate deputy DA for their input and information prior to the DVD Manager&rsquo;s final review. &nbsp;In conjunction with the DA&rsquo;s Office review, the DVD Manager may deny the use of such informants or may require control officer restrictions or case specific restrictions for informants who have problematic criminal histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2. The informant&rsquo;s criminal history should be summarized on this form from a review of the CCH and RegJIN printout.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3. If an informant has worked for other agencies in the past, contact the agency(s) and summarize the informant&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.4. Supervisors and managers will indicate approval and route to the DVD Manager for final approval. &nbsp;All informant files will be hand delivered to DVD for review.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.5. Supervisors or managers who find that a potential informant is unsuitable for employment may deny informant use at their RU level without forwarding the informant packet to DVD for final review.</p>
<p>6. Moniker File:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1. When different RUs use the same CRI, each unit will maintain a moniker file. &nbsp;All such cases will be approved by the DVD Manager. &nbsp;Requests for the multiple unit use of a CRI will be made by inter-office memorandum through channels to the DVD Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. True Name/Code Number Index Log (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.1. DVD will issue a semi-annual True Name/Code Number Index Log by RU that lists the informants currently in an active or inactive status. &nbsp;All units will maintain this log when using informants and/or disbursing evidence funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.2. This log will be justified each July and January with the files maintained by the RU. &nbsp;If there are discrepancies, the DVD administrative sergeant will be notified immediately in order to update the master files.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.3. This log will be maintained in a file folder with the Informant Profile and Liability form file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.4. The log will contain informant code numbers, complete true names, complete code names, dates, and Department of Public Safety Standards and Training number (DPSST #) of initiating member/investigator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Informant Code Numbers (Required):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.1. An informant code number must be assigned by a DVD supervisory sergeant prior to any informants receiving or expending evidence funds or being under the direction of a member who is actively working on a criminal investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.2. To maintain uniform accountability, the code number will be a unique sequential agent/informant number that is not assigned to any other informant. &nbsp;This will preclude an informant who works for more than one division from having different code number.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.3. The DVD supervisory sergeant will also run a check of the informant&rsquo;s true name through the Western States Identification Network (WSIN) database.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.4. The code name will be an alias. &nbsp;True names will not be used. &nbsp;The name will be a complete first, middle and last name. &nbsp;Initials and short names will not be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.5. The code number will be used in all receipt and record-keeping transactions (to include inter-office memos) involving the agent/informant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Agent/Informant Exceptions:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">9.1. The DVD Manager may waive the above process in special situations where the information is of such value it would be counter-productive to force the informant to identify themselves. &nbsp;Exceptions will be kept to a minimum and closely supervised. The DVD Manager will review all such cases with the Assistant Chief of the Investigations Branch.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">9.2. Exceptions may also be authorized by a RU Manager for one-time payments for information. &nbsp;An EFAR will be completed and the informant will sign using their true name. &nbsp;Exceptional payments will be reviewed by the DVD Manager for final approval after authorization by the involved RU Manager.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">9.3. Each division disbursing evidence funds will set up a file with an assigned code number (001) and a code name entitled &ldquo;Informant Exceptions.&rdquo; &nbsp;All Informant EFAR will be filed in this folder in chronological date order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.3.1. If the RU Manager grants an exception, the member disbursing funds will complete a receipt, printing in the code name Informant Exception.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.3.2. The code number for the informant exception file is 001 and will be used as the code number for all such exceptional payments.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.3.3. The RU Manager&rsquo;s name will be noted in the comment section of the receipt and the EFAR will be accompanied by an inter-office memorandum through channels from the control officer to the RU Manager and the DVD Manager explaining the justification for the exception.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.3.4. All other productivity information will be completed on the receipt.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.3.5. Informant Moniker and Reliability forms will not be completed on Informant Exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Evidence Fund Accounting Receipts:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">10.1. Receipts contain information on evidence funds disbursal, and informant productivity. The EFAR is an important link in the audit trail for evidence funds and in developing information related to criminal investigations. &nbsp;For these reasons, all member/investigators are reminded that:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">10.1.1. A signed receipt must be obtained for all fund disbursal to informants.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">10.1.4. An EFAR or written report (police report or inter-office memorandum) must be completed for all informant productivity when an expense is incurred or a material step is made toward fulfilling formal case consideration. &nbsp;These receipts and/or reports will be filed in an informant&rsquo;s moniker and productivity file as soon as possible after the expense or transaction.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">10.1.5. Informant code numbers and code names will not be mentioned in police reports. They will be used when completing the monthly EFAR.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">10.1.6. An informant will sign the full code name, including middle name, when signing a receipt.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">10.1.7. All divisions using informants must enter the following information into the informant EFAR database from EFAR on a monthly basis:</p>

Persons may observe or record from any public place or any private property where the person has the legal right to be present. &nbsp;However, this directive does not give any person permission to impede the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic or to disregard reasonable restrictions. &nbsp;Members shall not prohibit or intentionally interfere with lawful observations or recordings except as provided in this directive.&nbsp; Any recordings that are deemed to be evidence of a crime or relevant to an investigation shall only be collected, seized, or viewed in accordance with this directive and state and federal law.</span></sup></p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">1. Observing or Recording Law Enforcement Activity.</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The right of persons to observe or record law enforcement activity is not absolute and is subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions. &nbsp;Examples of such time, place, and manner restrictions include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Establishing a perimeter beyond which persons may not go;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring a person to keep a specified amount of distance between themselves and the persons or objects they seek to observe or film; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requiring a person to observe or record from a location that does not interfere with police operations; or&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; While observing or recording, persons cannot interfere with law enforcement activity.&nbsp; Examples of interference may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intentional and persistent attempts to distract or communicate with a witness or suspect with whom the police are speaking or engaging;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct physical intervention or breaching the specified amount of distance established by a member;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeated attempts to engage a member with questions or interruptions, thereby dividing the attention of the member to the matter at hand;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intentionally impeding the movement of emergency equipment or personnel;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inciting others to violate any law or any lawful command; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any action by the person that jeopardizes the safety or security of a member, victim, witness, suspect, or third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Member Response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may require a person recording police activities to maintain a reasonable distance from that police activity. &nbsp;Members shall consider the totality of the circumstances regarding the particular police activity in establishing a reasonable distance. &nbsp;Members shall not establish or increase a distance for the sole purpose of discouraging or interfering with the lawful recording or observation of police activities. &nbsp;Members are allowed to establish a distance that reasonably protects the privacy of any verbal communication between or among members, victims, witnesses, suspects, or third parties for their safety and the safety of members and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever practical, members should give clear and concise warnings to persons recording police activities when the person&rsquo;s behavior is &nbsp;unlawful, Accompanying the warnings, whenever practical, a member should give clear directions on what a person can do to be compliant and continue recording.&nbsp; For example, rather than simply directing a person to &ldquo;clear the area,&rdquo; a member should advise the person from where or at what distance the person may continue lawfully recording or observing the law enforcement activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event a person&rsquo;s observation or recording continues to interfere with law enforcement activities or a member believes that the recording(s) may contain evidence of or information concerning the commission of a Measure 11 offense, when practical, the on-scene member shall request that a supervisor respond to the scene.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under exigent circumstances, a member may take action to stop a community member from recording prior to communicating with their supervisor and shall document in their report articulable reasons for doing so.&nbsp; Members will notify a supervisor as soon as practical after the exigency is resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Seizing and Viewing Recordings.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may not order or coerce a person to show them recordings that have been made of law enforcement activities. &nbsp;But members may ask persons for consent to seize and view recordings.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seizing recordings and media.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may seize recording devices and media if:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The person recording consents to the seizure;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">3.2.1.1.1. A member obtaining consent shall have the person consenting fill out the written voluntary consent form and attach it to their report; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exigent circumstances exist to seize the recording device or media. Exigent circumstances require probable cause to believe the recording device or media contains evidence of or information concerning the commission of a Measure 11 offense, and the member must objectively believe that immediate seizure is necessary to prevent the destruction or tampering of such evidence contained on the recording device or media. &nbsp;The fact a recording device or media is capable of being deleted does not by itself create an exigency justifying a seizure.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">3.2.1.2.1. Members shall inform their supervisor of their action to seize a device as soon as practical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.2.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are no exigent circumstances, but there is probable cause to believe the recording device or media contains evidence of or information concerning the commission of a Measure 11 offense, the member must contact the Multnomah County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office and request it to issue a <em>Subpoena Duces Tecum</em> to seize the recording device or media.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should protect seized recording devices and media from remote access, such as through the use of a Faraday bag, to ensure legal viewing at a later time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewing recordings or information contained on recording devices and media.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may view recordings or information contained on seized devices and media if:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The person recording consents to the viewing;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The person recording possesses the recording device when arrested and is charged with a crime, and the member obtains a search warrant based on probable cause to view and duplicate the recording device&rsquo;s media; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.3.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exigent circumstances exist requiring the immediate viewing, for example, to prevent death or serious physical injury to a person.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owner of any surrendered or seized device or media must be given a property receipt.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; All instances of viewing and/or seizing recordings should be documented in an appropriate police report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Return of Recording Device.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recording device and its media should be held in police custody no longer than reasonably necessary for the police to obtain and execute a search warrant. &nbsp;The recording device and its media should then be returned promptly to the device&rsquo;s owner in accordance with Directive 660.10, Property and Evidence Procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. It is the policy of the Portland Police Bureau to recover stolen vehicles taken through criminal activity and to refrain from exercising authority in situations involving vehicles taken in civil disputes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1. Responding Member Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;Upon sufficient proof of ownership and indications that the vehicle has been stolen, members shall complete a General Offense report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1.&nbsp;In addition to completing the General Offense report, members shall also provide the PPB Stolen Vehicle Election of Tow Options/Acknowledgment of Risk, Release From Liability and Hold Harmless Agreement Form to the vehicle owner.&nbsp; The owner must indicate whether they wish to have the recovered vehicle towed at their own expense or wish to have the vehicle left at the recovery location if they are unable to retrieve it in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.1.1.&nbsp;Members shall explain to the owner that a failure to sign the form will result in the recovered vehicle being towed at the owner&rsquo;s expense.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reporting.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;Upon taking a stolen vehicle report, members shall immediately call the Auto Records Desk to insure the stolen vehicle is immediately entered into the Law Enforcement Data Systems (LEDS) and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;Proof of Ownership.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;In order to accept a report on a stolen car, members shall conduct a preliminary investigation. &nbsp;As part of that investigation, ownership must be established. &nbsp;One or more of the following may establish proof of ownership:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.1.&nbsp;The complainant is the registered owner (per any Department of Motor Vehicles [DMV]), which is substantiated by personal identification. Telephone reports may be accepted if the complainant can satisfactorily assure the reporting officer that they are the registered owner via corroborating sources (i.e., familiarity with vehicle, type, make, names of other registered owners, and unique features of the vehicle [e.g., bumper stickers, pre-existing damage]).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.2.&nbsp;The complainant provides documents from DMV indicating process of transfer of title.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.3.&nbsp;The complainant has possession of a title signed for transfer.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.6.&nbsp;If the person reporting the vehicle as stolen had possession under a rental/ lease agreement, the reporting person must present the valid rental/lease agreement or telephone verification by the rental company.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.7.&nbsp;The complainant is the owner of rented or leased vehicle and has completed the requirements set forth in ORS 164.138 (demand letter, 3-day waiting period, etc.).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.8.&nbsp;In situations that do not meet the previous criteria, officers must contact a supervisor for authorization to accept a report of a stolen vehicle. &nbsp;The person authorizing the report shall be documented in the report.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;Denial of Report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1.&nbsp;A stolen report will not be accepted under the following circumstances, which shall be deemed non-criminal and instead a civil disagreement:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.1.&nbsp;A spouse is the complainant.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.2.&nbsp;Divorce in progress.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.4.&nbsp;Unmarried partner, domestic partner, roommate, family member or juvenile children of complainant, or those in a dating relationship. &nbsp;Under these circumstances, a sergeant may authorize that a report be taken after at least 48 hours from the time of the initial notification to law enforcement.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.5.&nbsp;Business partners or associates.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.6.&nbsp;Vehicle is held by person(s) performing work on the vehicle (e.g., mechanic&rsquo;s lien).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.7.&nbsp;Vehicle in possession of co-signer on contract of purchase.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.8.&nbsp;Vehicle taken from a tow company or mechanic&rsquo;s garage, unless the owner is complainant.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.9.&nbsp;Vehicle purchased with a non-sufficient fund (NSF) check.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.15.&nbsp;Commercial or private sale of vehicle, for which partial payment has been made.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.2. A sergeant may authorize a report in cases falling into the categories above, in extraordinary circumstances to be documented in the report. &nbsp;The report must include notation of the authorizing member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;Fraud.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.1.&nbsp;Members may investigate:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.1.&nbsp;Fraud involving a title that has changed parties.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.2.&nbsp;DMV requests to investigate a title to a vehicle that is being registered and is listed as stolen.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.3.&nbsp;Fraudulently purchased vehicles.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.2. Officers shall complete a General Offense report if:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;All recovered vehicles must be confirmed by VIN and the LEDS/NCIC entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;Unless the recovered vehicle is a hazard, the member shall attempt to contact the vehicle owner via all methods listed prior to ordering a tow.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;If the owner indicated at the time of the initial report they wished to have the recovered vehicle towed at their own expense, the member shall have the vehicle towed if they are unable to contact the vehicle owner or if the vehicle owner is unable to respond in a timely fashion (a minimum of 60 minutes).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Anonymous Kit:&nbsp; A sexual assault forensic evidence kit collected from a victim who either has not made a decision to participate in the prosecution of the perpetrator or the sexual assault, or has chosen not to participate in the prosecution of the perpetrator of the sexual assault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anonymous Reporting of Sexual Assault: &nbsp;When a victim of a sexual assault does not want to report to law enforcement, but chooses to disclose their abuse to a medical provider who can perform a forensic medical exam to preserve evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Family or Household Member:&nbsp; Spouses; former spouses; adult persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; persons who are cohabiting or who have cohabited with each other; persons who have been involved in a sexually intimate relationship with each other within two years immediately preceding the filing by one of them of a petition to circuit court for relief; unmarried parents of a child.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-family Member: &nbsp;Any person not listed as a family member, including neighbors, friends, teachers, and other temporary child custodians and strangers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexual Assault:&nbsp; Any unwanted sexual contact from an individual, by means of touching the sexual or other intimate parts of a person or causing such person to touch the sexual or other intimate parts of the actor for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party, is considered an offense under Oregon State laws.&nbsp; The commission of or attempted commission of a sexual offense chargeable under State laws include rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration, sexual abuse, and purchasing sex with a minor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sexual Assault Victim Advocates (SAVA): &nbsp;Volunteers from either a local non-profit organization specializing in serving victims of sexual assault or from the District Attorney&rsquo;s office.&nbsp; These individuals respond to police requests through the Bureau of Emergency Communication (BOEC) to stay with a victim through hospital evaluation and care while also providing support and advocacy as needed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p>1. In accordance with Oregon State law, the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) shall designate a point of contact to serve as both PPB&rsquo;s Sexual Assault Kit (SAK) Program Coordinator and liaison to the Oregon State Police (OSP).&nbsp; This individual serves as a bridge between the two organizations and will be a resource for victims of sexual assault seeking information on their particular cases.&nbsp; PPB shall ensure that the contact information for the SAK Program Coordinator is communicated to local medical facilities and organizations that work with the Bureau to assist victims, thereby providing those affected by sexual assault with the knowledge on who to engage for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Contact with first responders is critical to a victim&rsquo;s decision as to whether or not to move forward in the criminal justice system and to the victim&rsquo;s recovery. &nbsp;Although it is necessary for members to investigate the crime scene, potential evidence, and suspects, members must also be sensitive to the difficulty of the situation for the victim. &nbsp;Bureau members are expected to use the following procedures when responding to a sexual assault.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<p>1. Responding Member Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;If emergency medical treatment is required, members shall request ambulance transport for the victim to the nearest hospital or the hospital of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;Members shall ensure they advise victims of the following:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;If a sexual assault occurred within the past 120 hours, members shall inform the victim that they have the option to have a forensic medical exam to collect evidence, also known as a sexual assault kit (SAK), for a criminal investigation at no cost to them. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.1.&nbsp;If the victim chooses to go to the hospital for an exam, members shall advise them not to eat or drink, bathe or change clothes prior to the examination, since evidence present on the victim&rsquo;s body and/or clothing may be destroyed or contaminated.&nbsp; Members shall also request through BOEC for a SAVA to respond to the hospital and if possible, members shall conduct an interview with the victim in the presence of the SAVA.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.2.1.1.1.&nbsp;If a member is present at the time that a SAK is collected and the victim has not received contact information for<em> </em>a SAK liaison from another source, the member shall provide the victim with contact information for the Bureau&rsquo;s<em> </em>SAK Program Coordinator who is responsible for receiving all inquiries (telephonic or otherwise) regarding SAKs.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2.&nbsp;For an incident older than 120 hours, a forensic exam is not necessary because DNA evidence deteriorates with time and may no longer be present. &nbsp;Members shall inform the victim of this but also explain that they can still go to the hospital for a wellness exam at no cost to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;Members shall call the Forensic Evidence Division (FED) so they can take photos of the victim and the scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;Members shall determine the location of the clothing worn by the victim during and/or immediately after the sexual assault. &nbsp;If the victim is still wearing the same clothes worn during the assault, recommend the victim bring a complete change of clothing to the hospital due to possible seizure of the clothes.&nbsp; If the victim is not wearing the same clothes worn during the assault, collect as evidence the clothes the victim wore during the assault if not yet laundered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;Members shall gather physical evidence in accordance with Section 4, Evidence Disposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6.&nbsp;Members shall forward reports of sexual assault in which the victim and suspect are family or household members to the Domestic Violence Reduction Unit (DVRU).&nbsp; The DVRU Supervisor may consult with the Sex Crimes Unit (SCU) Supervisor to determine if specific cases would be better investigated by SCU.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.7.&nbsp;Members shall complete an appropriate police report submitted through their Responsibility Unit and forward a copy to the Detective Division prior to the end of shift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Detective Division Responsibilities for Sexual Assault Investigations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;In the event detective contact is needed, responding member(s) shall inform their supervisor.&nbsp; The supervisor shall make contact with the Detective Division who shall determine the appropriate response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;An SCU Detective may be requested and assigned when the victim(s) are 14 years old and older and the perpetrator is a non-family member.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.1.1.1.&nbsp;The suspect is in custody for:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">2.1.1.1.1.&nbsp;Rape I.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">2.1.1.1.2.&nbsp;Sodomy I.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">2.1.1.1.4.&nbsp;Unlawful Sexual Penetration I and II.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.1.1.2.&nbsp;Cases in which an individual 18 years old or older decides to report an offense that occurred when they were a juvenile shall be referred to SCU detectives.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.2.&nbsp;A Child Abuse Team (CAT) Detective may be requested and assigned when the victim(s) are under 18 years old and the perpetrator is a family member.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.1.2.1.&nbsp;The suspect is in custody for:</p>

<p><strong>Definitions</strong><strong>: &nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Case Assignment: &nbsp;Police reports submitted by an initial officer that are determined by a supervisor or detective sergeant that an investigation is warranted are then assigned to a member by using the Record Management System (RMS).&nbsp; Assigned cases will typically be identified as &ldquo;Open&rdquo; (O), &ldquo;Pending Additional Information&rdquo; (U), or &ldquo;Arrest Protective Custody&rdquo; (D) in the RMS until the disposition code is changed to a closure status.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Disposition Codes: &nbsp;Identifiers listed in the RMS to describe the status of a case.&nbsp; Commonly used codes by members include inactive/suspended, unfounded, or one of the referral options.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Investigation:&nbsp; For the purpose of this directive, a case that warrants further follow-up to identify a suspect(s) or locate evidence is assigned to a specific sworn member.&nbsp; Misdemeanor investigations are generally conducted at the precinct level.&nbsp; Felony crimes and aggregate misdemeanor crimes are reviewed by the appropriate investigative unit under the Investigations Branch, with the exception of stolen or recovered vehicles without suspect leads.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Record Management System (RMS):&nbsp; A central database of police reports, name records, and other report data.&nbsp; Investigating members, detectives, and supervisors will use the RMS to document the progress of a case, track the status on each assigned case, and monitor all cases assigned for follow up.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. This directive establishes the procedures for Portland Police Bureau (PPB) members who use the Bureau&rsquo;s Record Management System (RMS) to manage investigative cases.&nbsp; Case management is a continuous and ongoing process that requires regular maintenance of information by investigating members and supervisors.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Member Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. On a weekly basis, members shall log into RMS to monitor assigned cases and identify any new cases assigned to them by their supervisor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2. Members shall update case information in the RMS as an investigation progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1. Members may use additional resources such as Microsoft Office applications to supplement the management of documentation (e.g., images, spreadsheets) through the course of their investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2. Investigative work using other resources must be added to the RMS in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4. Members shall input a closure status code at the conclusion or suspension of an investigation.&nbsp; For suspended cases, members shall provide a brief text entry, clarifying the closure status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Supervisors Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1. Supervisors shall use the RMS to track case progress in order to maintain uniformity and supervisory control regarding the assignment and closure of cases assigned for follow-up investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2. Supervisors shall review incoming police reports that are routed to their case management queue and determine the appropriate course. &nbsp;Supervisors shall determine whether to suspend further investigation of a case, assign an investigator to a case, or send the case to another responsibility unit (RU) for review.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.1. Supervisors shall evaluate whether to assign a case to an investigator based on the following criteria which include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.1. Physical custody of the suspect,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.2. Name of suspect is known,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.3. Serial pattern crimes,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.4. Level of violence or severity of the crime (Measure 11),</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.5. Presence of physical or electronic evidence, or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.6. Cooperation of the victim(s) and/or witness(es).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.2. If a supervisor determines that there is not enough information to assign a case to an investigator, they shall suspend the case in RMS using an appropriate closure status code.&nbsp; When needed, supervisors who suspend a case shall document the reason for the closure.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3. Supervisors shall ensure cases that are being actively investigated or reopened from a suspended status are identified in the RMS as &ldquo;open&rdquo; and have an investigator assigned.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4. Supervisors shall review each member&rsquo;s assigned cases every 90 days for updates. Supervisors shall follow up on cases flagged as &ldquo;overdue&rdquo; in the RMS and assign more time on the case or cease further investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Responsibility Unit Manager or Designee Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1. The RU Manager may directly assign a case at their discretion.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2. The RU Manager or their designee shall log into RMS every 180 days, at a minimum, to check case statuses.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.1. The RU Manager and any designee must have adequate permissions within the RMS.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.2.&nbsp;Incidents of child sexual abuse may be coordinated between DHS and the Bureau&rsquo;s Operations Support Unit (OSU), however, OSU may take the report only under the following conditions:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.2.1.&nbsp;The child is currently safe and away from the perpetrator and the incident is being reported 120 hours after occurrence.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.2.2.&nbsp;The caller is reluctant to make a direct report to a uniform member.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.2.3.&nbsp;The caller is out of the area and their local law enforcement agency will not take a courtesy report regarding an incident that occurred within Portland.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boxing In: A coordinated tactic of making contact between police vehicles and a suspect&rsquo;s&nbsp;vehicle to stop or prevent the start of a pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marked Unit: An emergency police vehicle equipped with overhead lights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuit: An active, deliberate attempt by one or more members to apprehend one or more&nbsp;occupants of another moving vehicle, when it is reasonably apparent that the driver of that vehicle is aware of that attempt and is resisting apprehension by increasing speed, disobeying traffic laws, or attempting to elude the officer through evasive maneuvers or tactics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT): A driving technique designed to stop a fleeing&nbsp;motorist safely and quickly by making contact with the fleeing car at a specific point on the vehicle, which throws the car into a spin and brings it to a stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramming: The use of an emergency (police) vehicle, other than in a pursuit intervention&nbsp;technique or boxing in maneuver, to purposely cause contact with another vehicle in order to disable the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop/Spike Strips: Devices used to deflate tires in a controlled fashion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle: For purposes of this Directive, a vehicle is a motorized vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vehicle Intervention Strategies: Tactics which may be used to stop or reduce the speed of a&nbsp;fleeing vehicle in an attempt to reduce safety risks posed to the community, the suspect, and members (e.g. barricading, boxing in, pursuit intervention technique, ramming, stop/spike strips).</p>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1. The Bureau recognizes that vehicle pursuits are dynamic and rapidly evolving in nature and, as a result, have inherent safety risks. Therefore, members are expected to be able to articulate their decision-making with regard to pursuits, and for engaging in and/or continuing a pursuit. The choice to engage in and/or continue a pursuit shall be objectively reasonable under the totality of circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2. Members shall be trained in pursuit management. In an effort to uphold the Bureau&rsquo;s commitment to protecting human life and property, members must balance the safety risks posed to the community against the benefit of capture before initiating and while continuing the pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Pursuit Authorization.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp; Members shall only initiate a pursuit of a suspect fleeing in a vehicle when there is reasonable suspicion to believe the suspect committed a felony person crime or where the suspect&rsquo;s driving conduct, prior to the initiation of a stop, displays a willful disregard for the safety of others that reasonably places the public in immediate danger of serious bodily harm or death.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp; Members shall not engage in a pursuit under the following circumstances:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;The suspect&rsquo;s identity is known and the suspect can be apprehended at a future time, and if the suspect&rsquo;s driving behavior, prior to the initiation of a stop, does not place the public in immediate danger of serious bodily harm or death.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2.&nbsp;Police vehicles carrying suspects, complainants or witnesses shall not become involved in pursuits.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.3.&nbsp;Cadets shall not become involved in pursuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp; Members shall disengage from a pursuit under the following circumstances:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;If the member is driving any vehicle other than a four-wheeled pursuit-rated marked unit when a pursuit is initiated, that member shall disengage primary pursuit when a four-wheeled pursuit-rated marked unit is in position to assume the pursuit.&nbsp; The disengaging unit may follow at a safe distance until the conclusion of the pursuit.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.2.&nbsp;Police vehicles carrying passengers other than members, including ride-alongs, chaplains or cadets, shall disengage primary pursuit when a four-wheeled pursuit- rated marked unit is in position to assume the pursuit.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.3.&nbsp;The pursuit has entered another jurisdiction, another agency has taken over the primary role in the pursuit, and the other agency has adequate cover present.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.4.&nbsp;If a collision occurs as a result of the pursuit that is reasonably likely to require immediate medical assistance and more than one police vehicle is in pursuit, at least one pursuing member shall disengage from the pursuit and render appropriate aid while the other members continue pursuit. If only one police vehicle is in pursuit and a collision occurs as a result of the pursuit that is reasonably likely to require immediate medical assistance, but the benefit of capture outweighs disengagement, the pursuing member must call for immediate backup to render appropriate aid; the involved member may continue the pursuit.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.4.1.&nbsp;For minor accidents not requiring immediate medical assistance, supporting members who are not engaged in the pursuit shall respond to the scene of the accident.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.4.2.&nbsp;If a member is involved in a collision, they will immediately broadcast that information.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp; When a member initiates a pursuit that they reasonably believe constitutes an extraordinary circumstance, the member shall immediately notify their supervisor of the pursuit and must receive permission to continue the pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">2.&nbsp; Pursuit Balancing Factors.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp; The below factors should be taken into consideration before deciding to initiate a pursuit, and these factors should be reassessed on an ongoing basis in deciding to continue or reengage in a pursuit. Members must be able to articulate reasons why the benefit of capture outweighs the safety risks posed to the community in the pursuit. Members must terminate a pursuit when the safety risks posed to the community clearly outweigh the benefit of capture. Key factors include:</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;The seriousness of the offense committed, and the risk the suspect(s) poses to the community.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.2.&nbsp;The suspect&rsquo;s driving behavior and vehicle condition, as well as the presence of passengers in the fleeing vehicle.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.3.&nbsp;The member&rsquo;s knowledge of the area(s), proximity of cover and feasibility of implementing pursuit intervention strategies.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.4.&nbsp;The type of area, volume and presence of other vehicles and/or pedestrian traffic, and environmental and visibility conditions.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">3. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1. &nbsp;Only a maximum of three units shall engage in a pursuit with lights and sirens continuously activated. Upon initiation, at least one member in the pursuit shall frequently broadcast pertinent information (e.g. location, speed, direction, conditions, requests for specific interventions, etc.). The primary unit shall immediately notify the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) of the reasons for the pursuit and stay involved in some capacity until termination.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1.&nbsp;Exceptions to the three unit maximum may be authorized by a supervisor under very limited circumstances and only when an unusually dangerous situation dictates (e.g. multiple dangerous suspects, shots fired, armed robbery, etc.). Supervisory approval for additional pursuit vehicles must be authorized by voice over the air.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.2.&nbsp;The decision to attempt to use a pursuit intervention technique maneuver will not alone be a justification for a fourth unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2. &nbsp;The managing supervisor will announce their role over the radio, declare if the pursuit is authorized to continue, and respond to the area of the pursuit; supervisors involved in the pursuit shall not assume management responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp; Involved members and the supervisor should remain on the initial talk group (precinct dispatch net).&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.4.&nbsp; Other members/units in the general vicinity of the pursuit who are not directly involved may proceed with caution to a position that would assist in perimeter support or to deploy stop/spike sticks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.&nbsp; When feasible, the Air Support Unit will become the primary unit in a pursuit. The ground units will continue at a safe distance and at a reduced speed to respond and take control at the conclusion of the pursuit. The managing supervisor will maintain overall control of the pursuit and potential use of intervention strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"">4.&nbsp; Pursuit Intervention Strategies and Standards.</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1. &nbsp;Members may only employ pursuit intervention strategies that are Bureau approved and that they have been trained to use.</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2.&nbsp; Members may use the pursuit intervention strategies listed below with lights/siren warnings when it is objectively reasonable to do so under the totality of the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3.&nbsp; When feasible, it is the supervisor&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure pursuit intervention strategies are planned and deployed as soon as practical.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.4.&nbsp; Members should, if time and circumstances permit, continually broadcast their intentions and actions as they use pursuit intervention strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.5.&nbsp; Members may use the following Bureau-approved strategies. Unless otherwise noted, these strategies shall implicate force.</p>
<p class=""WordSection4"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.5.1.&nbsp;<em>Boxing In</em>: This tactic may be employed preemptively, meaning without lights/siren warnings, if a pursuit of the subject vehicle would be permitted under Section 1.1. of this directive. This tactic may also be employed preemptively in a static environment (e.g., the driver appears incapacitated or unconscious; the subject vehicle is stationary in a parking lot) if the benefit gained outweighs the inherent risks of the maneuver. Finally, this tactic may be employed preemptively in a dynamic environment (e.g., the subject vehicle is temporarily stopped at a traffic control device) when there is probable cause to arrest a suspect in a vehicle and the totality of the circumstances indicates the suspect will attempt to avoid detention and arrest, or when the suspect&rsquo;s driving behavior displays a willful disregard for the safety of others which reasonably places the public in immediate danger of serious bodily harm or death.&nbsp; As described in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, boxing in will be investigated as a Category IV use of force, if conducted at speeds at or below 20 miles per hour in conjunction with training. If the tactic is conducted at speeds above 20 miles per hour, the intent and manner in which the technique is used shall be considered to determine the appropriate category of force, as described in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force. Members are required to provide substantial justification under these circumstances, and supervisors have the discretion to elevate the category of the force investigation.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.5.2.&nbsp;<em>Pursuit Intervention Technique</em>: This tactic shall not be used on two-wheeled vehicles, passenger-occupied buses, and vehicles transporting hazardous materials. This tactic may be employed preemptively, meaning without lights/siren warnings, when there is probable cause to arrest a suspect in a vehicle and the totality of the circumstances indicates the suspect will attempt to avoid detention and arrest, or when the suspect&rsquo;s driving behavior displays a willful disregard for the safety of others which reasonably places the public in immediate danger of serious bodily harm or death.&nbsp; As described in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, the PIT maneuver will be investigated as a Category III use of force, if conducted at speeds at or below 45 miles per hour in conjunction with training. If the tactic is conducted at speeds above 45 miles per hour, the intent and manner in which the technique is used shall be considered to determine the appropriate category of force, as described in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force. Members are required to provide substantial justification under these circumstances, and supervisors have the discretion to elevate the category of the force investigation.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.5.3.&nbsp;<em>Ramming</em>: Members should only employ this tactic in extraordinary circumstances. Any use of ramming requires substantial justification. As described in Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, ramming will be reviewed as a Category II use of force; however, supervisors have the discretion to elevate the category of the force investigation. The intent and manner in which the technique is used shall be considered when making the determination to elevate the investigation.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.5.4.&nbsp;<em>Stop/Spike Strips</em>: This tactic is not considered force.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"">5.&nbsp; Pursuits Involving Other Jurisdictions.</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1. &nbsp;For pursuits coming into the Bureau&rsquo;s jurisdiction from another jurisdiction, the managing supervisor will determine whether members will become involved in the pursuit. If the supervisor determines that the Bureau will assist in the pursuit, members may only engage in the pursuit consistent with this policy, regardless of the policies of the originating jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2.&nbsp; For pursuits beginning in Bureau jurisdiction but leaving from this jurisdiction, it is the responsibility of a member of the primary pursuing unit to: 1) inform the receiving jurisdiction of the conditions giving rise to the pursuit and the actions taken during the pursuit; and 2) request assistance from the receiving jurisdiction. If the receiving jurisdiction agrees to assume primary control of the pursuit, once that transfer occurs, the Bureau will only continue the pursuit in a supporting role. If the receiving agency elects to terminate the pursuit while in that jurisdiction, PPB members will also terminate the pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3.&nbsp; Supervisors shall manage notification and direct control of pursuits that either extend into or are received from other jurisdictions, including the State of Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection5"">6.&nbsp; Pursuit Termination.</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1.&nbsp; Members must terminate a pursuit when the safety risks posed to the community clearly outweigh the benefit of capturing the suspect. Termination may be called by any sworn member, whether involved in the pursuit or not. Members will terminate a pursuit when ordered to do so by any supervisor. Members will terminate a pursuit that travels into the State of Washington, unless the underlying offense is a violent person-to-person felony.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.2.&nbsp; Once a pursuit is terminated, involved members shall verbally acknowledge the termination over the radio, disengage and stop following the suspect vehicle. If involved in the pursuit, the Air Support Unit may continue to monitor the fleeing vehicle, but reengagement by ground units is limited by Section 7 of this Directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.3.&nbsp; Per Directive 310.20, Retaliation Prohibited, members shall not retaliate against involved members regarding the decision to terminate a pursuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.4.&nbsp; Members shall refer concerned property owner(s) whose property may have been damaged during a pursuit to the City of Portland's Risk Management Office, in accordance with Directive 220.40, Lawsuits and Claims.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"">7.&nbsp; Pursuit Reengagement.</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"" style=""padding-left: 30px;"">7.1. &nbsp;After termination, a member may reengage a pursuit of the suspect vehicle only if the member is able to articulate new reasons why the benefit of capture outweighs the safety risks posed to the community as a consequence of the pursuit (See Section 1, Pursuit Authorization and Section 2, Pursuit Balancing Factors).&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection6"">8.&nbsp; Reporting.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">8.1.&nbsp; Involved members shall complete an appropriate police report detailing the pursuit in accordance with directives, and supervisors will complete any required force investigations in accordance with Directive 1010.00, Use of Force, or Directive 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reports. The intervention strategies detailed above when used on a subject&rsquo;s vehicle are not accidents, and thus do not require accident related investigation and reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Supervisor Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">9.1.&nbsp; In managing a pursuit, supervisors shall:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.1.&nbsp;Determine if the pursuit is prohibited.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.2.&nbsp;Continually balance the safety risks posed to the community against the benefit of capture in managing the pursuit.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.3.&nbsp;Authorize and direct additional units to engage in a pursuit.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.4.&nbsp;Ensure radio communication between all applicable parties.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.5.&nbsp;Devise, approve and direct appropriate pursuit intervention strategies to end a pursuit as quickly as possible, so as to avoid or mitigate safety risks.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.6.&nbsp;Manage notification and direct control of pursuits that either extend into or are received from other jurisdictions.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.7.&nbsp;Order the pursuit be terminated when necessary (e.g., members are not adequately broadcasting updates, intervention strategies are not being planned or implemented, the safety risks posed to the community clearly outweigh the benefit of capture).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">9.1.7.1.&nbsp;If ordering termination of a pursuit, verify with the involved member(s) their location at the time of the pursuit termination and document that location in the After Action Report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.8.&nbsp;Ensure reports are completed in accordance with directives.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.9.&nbsp;Conduct a debriefing with all involved members. The debrief should include an overview of the pursuit and, when applicable, a discussion of any vehicle intervention strategies employed. Confirm that the debrief occurred in the After Action Report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">9.1.10.&nbsp;Complete an after action review and follow reporting requirements based on the category of force outlined in Direction 1010.00, Use of Force, and determine whether higher scrutiny is warranted based on the speed at which the vehicle intervention strategy was used pursuant to Section 4.4.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">9.1.10.1.&nbsp;If no force is used, supervisors shall conduct a pursuit after action investigation pursuant to Directive 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;Command Staff Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">10.1. &nbsp;The Assistant Chief of Operations, or designee, shall prepare an annual report analyzing Police Bureau pursuits.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">10.2.&nbsp; Command staff shall review the annual report, discuss trends, identify gaps, and direct necessary policy and training updates in accordance with Directive 1500.00, Training.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>POLICY (740.00)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau will immediately respond on calls of bomb threats and suspected explosive devices using the following procedures in order to protect the lives of citizens, protect the lives of members and protect property.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (740.00)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Major post-blast: A blast scene where there is injury and/or major property damage. Major post-blast scenes will be treated as a major crime scene.</p>
<p>Minor post-blast: A blast scene where there is only slight damage to property, (i.e., vandalism by explosive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bomb Threats (740.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Any member who receives information pertaining to a bomb threat will immediately notify the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) and a supervisor. If the member receiving the threat is in the building or location that is the target of the threat, communication will be by landline telephone, as radio broadcasts may interfere with explosive devices.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If possible, members will obtain the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific address and/or building location or name, floor, room number and location in the room the device has been placed.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The type of bomb, its physical description and/or container.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The time the device will detonate.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The reason the device was placed (motivation).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;The individual or group claiming responsibility.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;BOEC will dispatch, by radio, a district car and detail sergeant or other supervisor to the location of the threat. BOEC will advise the nature of the call using appropriate radio codes (33B). In all calls involving bomb threats, a supervisor will respond to the scene.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Responders will use only hand-held radios within 100 feet of these calls (one block). Turn off all other devices (car radio, MDC, and cellular phones; pagers that receive only are okay).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;If a device has been located, do not transmit within 100 feet or until told to do so by an Explosive Disposal Unit (EDU) member.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If members are there in response to a bomb threat, turn off pack set until the immediate area has been searched. Never search an area with the radio on.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If&nbsp; you&nbsp; must&nbsp; transmit,&nbsp; move&nbsp; to&nbsp; an&nbsp; area&nbsp; that&nbsp; has&nbsp; already&nbsp; been searched.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in a high-rise structure, move up or down at least two floors from the target floor to an exterior wall by a window before transmitting.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Members and supervisors will assist the person in charge of the targeted location in evaluating the bomb threat for validity and need for further action. Some of the factors to consider are specifics of the threat, nature of targeted location, time of detonation, physical access to the site, and current events at the location.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; The person in charge of the targeted location will have the responsibility to determine if a search is to be conducted.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;Members will assist in the organization and search of a building/premise if requested.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will complete a written report detailing the threat and subsequent police actions. If information supports an investigation, the report will be forwarded to Detective Division Arson Detail for follow-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suspected Explosive Devices and/or Known Explosives (740.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;If a suspected or actual explosive device is located, members will clear the immediate and adjacent areas. Members should move at least 100 feet from the suspected device before turning on any radio communication equipment (hand-held radio, car radio, cell phone, etc.) and notifying BOEC. Hand-held radios generate less radio energy, therefore they should be used for all on-scene communications.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Members will not touch or move any suspected device.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Once an area is clear of civilians, members should retreat to an area of substantial cover.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;EDU will assume command of the scene upon their arrival and until the area is declared safe to enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evacuation Decision (740.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a threat is received by any facility, building and/or premise, public or private, the decision to evacuate is the responsibility of the person in charge of that facility, building or premises. In multi-tenant buildings where an evacuation has been undertaken, members will ensure all tenants are aware an evacuation is occurring.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event a suspect device is found, the ranking member on the scene, or EDU member, will secure the area and start an evacuation of the immediate and adjacent areas.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not route evacuating personnel by or near a suspected explosive device. Keep all persons away from glass windows and doors. Once civilians have been moved away from the suspected device(s), the ranking member will also ensure public safety personnel have moved to a location that provides substantial hard cover while allowing members to keep a secure perimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Post-Blast Procedures (740.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Minor post-blasts that involve slight damage may be handled by the assigned responding officer following a telephone conversation with EDU (i.e., small explosions by plastic bottle bombs or fireworks). All pipe bomb blasts will be investigated by EDU in conjunction with a fire investigator.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where there is injury and/or major property damage, members will treat this as a major crime scene. Because of the possibility of a secondary explosion, members will ensure that once the injured person(s) is removed, all public safety personnel move away from the blast scene to a location that provides substantial hard cover. EDU and the Arson detective will be notified immediately.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;EDU will assume command of the scene on their arrival and until the area is declared safe to enter. They will provide technical assistance to the Detective Division (Detectives) in processing the scene.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Detectives will be responsible for the follow-up investigation.</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (710.00)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau will assist the Secret Service with any visit of a federally designated protectee. Additionally, the Bureau will provide security and protection to other individuals when directed to do so by the Chief of Police or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (710.00)</strong></p>
<p>The following procedures will be employed in order to provide security for Secret Service protectees when visiting the City:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Upon notification from the Secret Service, the Operations Branch chief will designate a captain as the overall coordinator and incident commander. However, if the visitor is to be the President of the United States the incident supervisor will be the Operations Branch chief.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assigned supervisor will prepare an operations order establishing the assignments for the Bureau. The order will be modified by addenda from assisting RU&rsquo;s. The operations order will contain the following:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Situation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Mission.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Execution.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Service Support.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Command and Signal.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;During the visit, the incident supervisor, or his/her designee, will travel in any motorcade and remain on-site during all appearances.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; The incident supervisor will immediately notify other units within the Bureau of the pending visit. At a minimum, the following will be notified:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Criminal Intelligence Division.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Detective Division (Detectives).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Forensic Evidence Division (Forensics).</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Public Information Officer (PIO).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;All Operations Branch RU Commanders (including Reserves).</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC).</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Tactical Operations Division (TOD).</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Operations Support Unit (TRU).</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Records Division Manager.</p>
<p>10. The Secret Service will normally notify the following as part of their procedure: Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, Oregon State Police, Fire Bureau and Portland Traffic Engineer.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;As visitation sites and hotel accommodations are identified by the Secret Service, the precinct responsible for the geographical area will be assigned site responsibility. Each site will have a sergeant assigned to the Secret Service who will have responsibility to coordinate with the motorcade and the Secret Service in order to provide the necessary support. The primary or other identified sergeant will be at the site during the visit. Any major site with the President of the United States as the dignitary will require a lieutenant as the site supervisor.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; All Operations Branch RUs will identify a reserve force of members with a supervisor to assist in the event that they may be needed.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;BOEC will be requested to provide a radio net and a dispatcher. During the actual movements of the dignitary, a member who is familiar with the operations order will be present at BOEC. The Secret Service will also be requested to staff that location with an agent who is familiar with their operations.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;The Mounted Patrol will be made available and may be staged in an area so as to be available for crowd control.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forensics will be available to photograph demonstrations in order to record criminal activity.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Detective Division Mass Arrest Team will be placed on standby. The Detective Division will also staff the command post during overnight visits.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;The Secret Service will establish a command post prior to the arrival of the dignitary. The command post will be staffed 24 hours a day by a sworn member when the protectee is in the Portland metropolitan area. The command post communication equipment will be tested ahead of the visit. If the need arises, the Bureau of Electronic Services will be asked to assist in order to have reliable communications with the command post.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; &nbsp;During any visit, radio earphones will be provided to members involved in a demonstration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security/Protection Measures for Other Individuals (710.00)</strong></p>
<p>The providing of security for other individuals by the Bureau will be determined by the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police will designate an incident supervisor who will determine the appropriate course of action based on the requirements of the event.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/529199

</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Active Violence:<em> </em>An incident involving an armed person(s) who has the ability and intent to use or has used deadly force on other persons and continues to do so while having unrestricted access to additional victims. &nbsp;These incidents include circumstances under which the threat of deadly force may include but are not limited to a suspect&rsquo;s use of knives, firearms, vehicles and/or explosive devices.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Cold Zone:<em> </em>A geographic area where first responders can operate with minimal threat to personal safety or health.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Contact Element:<em> </em>The officer(s) at the scene of an active violence incident tasked with locating the suspect(s) and stopping the threat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hot Zone:<em> </em>A geographic area, consisting of the immediate incident location, with a direct and immediate threat to personal safety or health. &nbsp;All violent incidents are considered hot until law enforcement determines otherwise. &nbsp;Only law enforcement should operate in the hot zone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incident Commander (IC):<em> </em>The individual responsible for on-scene incident activities, including developing incident objectives and ordering and releasing resources.&nbsp; The IC has overall authority and responsibility for conducting incident operations and is responsible for the management of all operations at the incident site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unified Command:&nbsp; A structure that brings together the Incident Commanders of major organizations involved in the incident in order to coordinate an effective response, while at the same time allowing each to carry out their own jurisdictional, legal, and functional responsibilities.&nbsp; In this structure, there is no one single IC; the incident is managed by jointly approved objectives identified by participating organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warm Zone:&nbsp; The geographic area of operation that has been cleared of any immediate safety threats and has security measures in place.&nbsp; This is an area where a victim staging area may be established and life-saving medical care will be provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this directive is to provide protocols for assessing an active violence threat and immediately intervening to limit serious injury or loss of life during such incidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Active violence incidents pose an ongoing deadly threat to the safety of individuals present at the site of the incident and the community at large.&nbsp; Therefore, it is the policy of the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) to require immediate reasonable action by its members at the scene of active violence incidents, including the objectively reasonable use of force, to achieve three primary goals: neutralize the threat, prevent access to additional potential victims, and rescue injured victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>1. The Bureau shall use the national, standardized, and exhaustive system established in the Incident Command System (ICS) to plan and manage significant incidents and events.&nbsp; Members shall refer to Directive 700.00, National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS), for specific guidance regarding incident management.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;Depending on the scale of the active violence incident, the individual IC&rsquo;s role in handling the command function of ICS may be expanded into a Unified Command (UC). &nbsp;Unified Command shall be established as soon as possible for incidents in which multiple jurisdictions and agencies are involved in a collective response effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Individual Member Intervention Prior to Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) Notification.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;In some instances, an individual member may be present in or near the active violence location (e.g., a mall or school). &nbsp;Whether on or off duty, in uniform or civilian clothes, the member may determine that immediate action is necessary and reasonable to stop the threat(s).&nbsp; However, the member must contemplate whether they are capable of effectively intervening based on their training and equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;When displaying firearms while in plainclothes, members shall, if feasible, verbally identify themselves as law enforcement officials, and conspicuously display their badges and/or other law enforcement identification to alert security personnel, arriving members, or civilians who may be armed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;When tactically feasible, members shall notify BOEC that an active violence situation exists. &nbsp;The member(s) should provide the following information and updates as available:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.1.&nbsp;A description of the suspect;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.2.&nbsp;General location of the suspect; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.3.&nbsp;An estimated number of victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Situational Assessment.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;Based on available information, members already at the incident scene shall attempt to verify that an active violence situation exists through information provided by communications personnel; from persons confined within or exiting the target location; from witnesses; by reports of, or indicators of active violence; or through related means.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;As time and resources permit, members on-scene shall ask witnesses or others for any detailed information about the incident so they form a tactical response to locate the suspect(s).&nbsp; Members on-scene shall communicate the information they gathered and broadcast their situation over the radio to inform responding members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Contact Element(s) Response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;The objective of the contact element is to locate and neutralize the threat(s). &nbsp;Even if the threat seemingly has been terminated, contact element(s) are required to render the location safe, assist in screening and the orderly evacuation of persons to a designated area, and locating any other persons still in hiding.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2.&nbsp;Multiple contact elements may be needed to locate the assailant(s) and neutralize the threat(s) to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3.&nbsp;When feasible, the contact element(s) shall attempt to provide a clear communications channel to supply the following types of information:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.3.1.&nbsp;Actions with regard to the suspect(s) and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.3.2.&nbsp;The location and number of victims and their medical needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.4. The contact element(s) shall locate the suspect(s) in the most expeditious manner possible in order to stop the threat(s). &nbsp;In an active violence situation, the priority of members is to neutralize the threat(s), not to render medical aid to injured victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.5.&nbsp;In the absence of clear indicators, members shall search the scene with the intent of locating the assailant(s) and/or injured persons.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.6.&nbsp;Arriving tactical or other officers should be called upon to help clear the location of potential suspects, locate and evacuate persons in hiding, and render safe any dangerous munitions or armament.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.7.&nbsp;After neutralizing the threat(s) and clearing the location, the contact element(s) shall immediately shift their objective to providing medical response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Incident Commander Responsibilities.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1.&nbsp;The IC shall ensure that the following actions are accomplished:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.1.&nbsp;Ensure the Special Emergency Reaction Team (SERT) is activated in accordance with Directive 720.00, Special Emergency Reaction Team (SERT) and Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT) Use;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.3.&nbsp;Establish a command post and assign a recorder to document actions;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.4.&nbsp;Organize and establish unified interagency communication(s) with other essential agencies responding to the incident scene such as Portland Fire and Rescue (PF&amp;R), Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and other law enforcement agencies;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.5.&nbsp;Establish an inner perimeter to control access to and egress from the area of risk;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.6.&nbsp;Establish an outer perimeter;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.7.&nbsp;Establish staging areas in the cold zone for the following purposes and notify BOEC of their locations:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.7.1.&nbsp;For responding members and other emergency personnel (A staging area manager designated by the IC shall brief arriving personnel, maintain communication with the contact element(s), and assign duties as directed by the IC.);</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.7.2.&nbsp;For treatment of the injured and evacuation by EMS or medevac;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.7.3.&nbsp;Where individuals without injuries should be directed for identification and debriefing (evacuation area);</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.7.4.&nbsp;To accommodate arriving family members and/or friends of persons at the incident scene (Resource center); and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.7.5.&nbsp;For the media (This Joint Information Center should be staffed with appropriate personnel, such as public information officers.)</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.8. Ensure that members assigned to the notification center maintain accountability of the individuals involved in the incident by documenting their identities until they can be reunited with family or others. &nbsp;Victims and witnesses suffering from emotional and/or physical trauma or shock should be kept under the observation of medical personnel until such time as they may be safely transported to a hospital or home in the care of family or friends;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.9.&nbsp;Summon chaplains and peer support officers to provide emotional support to victims and witnesses and information to family and friends of the victims;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.10.&nbsp;Request mutual aid, if necessary;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.11.&nbsp;Establish traffic control and management for the ingress and egress of public safety vehicles. &nbsp;Special consideration should be given to maintain open routes for rapid transport of the injured;</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.14.&nbsp;Coordinate with PF&amp;R and EMS to deploy the Rescue Task Force (RTF) but only after the contact element(s) has made entry, provided a status report, notified the command post of the location of victims, established warm zones, and determined that rescue efforts may begin;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.15.&nbsp;Initiate intelligence gathering on possible suspects;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.16.&nbsp;Coordinate with owners or officials of the target location for floor plans; site layout; and a roster, including emergency contact information as available, of employees, students, residents, visitors, or others believed to be on-site;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.17.&nbsp;Coordinate with investigative units to ensure the scene is properly preserved once the event enters the criminal investigation phase; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.18.&nbsp;Write an After Action in accordance with Directive 905.00, Non-Force After Action Reporting, or 1010.00, Use of Force, if force was used.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">5.1.18.1.&nbsp;For incidents involving uses of deadly force, death as a result of member use of force or an in-custody death, members shall adhere to reporting and investigation requirements set forth in Directive 1010.10, Deadly Force and In-Custody Death Reporting and Investigation Procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Reunification Process.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1.&nbsp;Depending on the nature and location of an active violence incident, the IC must determine whether to evacuate and transport uninjured victims and witnesses to another location.&nbsp; In circumstances where evacuation is necessary, the IC shall broadcast over the radio the need for a reunification site away from the incident area to reunite family and friends.&nbsp; The IC or their designee shall: &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.1.1.&nbsp;Identify a location in reasonable proximity to the incident area that has the capacity to receive the appropriate amount of individuals;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.1.2.&nbsp;Identify a secondary location in the event the primary reunification site is overwhelmed;</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Activation Tiers: There are three progressive tiers of activation: 1) Unit Assistance, 2) Limited Deployment, and 3) Activation.
<ul>
<li><em>Unit Assistance</em>: Special Emergency Reaction Team (SERT) and Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT) members used to assist during incidents short of full activation<em>.</em>&nbsp; Such assistance is limited to members utilizing the less-lethal tools and equipment that are available to SERT and CNT, and are not available for patrol operations (e.g., pole cameras, robots, armored vehicles, etc.), and where SERT and CNT does not provide supervisory oversight of the incident.&nbsp; On-duty assistance is not a substitute for a limited deployment or full activation. &nbsp;A Critical Incident Commander (CIC) is not required to respond for this level of activation.</li>
<li><em>Limited Deployment</em>: A tactical response authorized by a CIC that includes SERT only, CNT only, or a partial response by either or both units utilizing tools or tactics available to the CIC.</li>
<li><em>Activation</em>: Receiving an order to report for duty. SERT and CNT members will report to the requested location, prepare for deployment, and respond to mission requests at the direction of the On-Scene Incident Commander or CIC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriate Initiative: The authority delegated to SERT and CNT by the CIC, unless specifically suspended during a call, to safely resolve an incident before they are able to request and receive permission from the CIC (i.e., &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo;).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Post: Any location, fixed or mobile, designated by the On-Scene Incident Commander or CIC from where operations are directed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical Incident Commander (CIC): A specially trained on-call command person who responds to all SERT and CNT activations (other than unit assistance), high-risk warrants, and any other event designated by the Chief of Police or designee. The CIC has the authority and responsibility for all police actions related to the incident and reports to the designated Assistant Chief during emergency activations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>On-Scene Incident Commander: The highest-ranking sworn Police Bureau member who assumes command at the scene of an incident prior to the CIC assuming command.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Police Action: Any circumstance, on or off duty, in which a sworn member exercises or attempts to exercise police authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid Response Team (RRT): The Bureau&rsquo;s all-hazard team of members who are specially trained to assist in the response to manmade/natural disasters and other emergency management situations which include, but are not limited to, the management and control of crowds through various tactics and techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Special Weapons: Any weapons provided or approved by the Bureau and authorized to be used only by trained SERT and RRT members in a police action.&nbsp; Examples of special weapons include non-aerosol contained chemical agents (including CS gas), automatic weapons, rifles and other special tactical weapons and ammunition.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1. This Directive sets forth the protocols for accessing SERT and CNT resources, prescribes when the use of the units is mandatory, establishes a clear chain of command during activations, and defines responsibilities.</p>
<p>2. In accordance with the Police Bureau&rsquo;s mission, members will make every effort to ensure the safety of everyone involved in an incident while attempting to de-escalate and resolve special emergency situations. &nbsp;The Bureau recognizes that some incidents may require the support of specially trained incident commanders and tactical and negotiating teams to increase the ability to safely resolve these situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There is nothing in this directive that would prohibit a member of SERT from taking police action outside of team activations.&nbsp; In these instances, SERT members shall follow directives and training guidelines set forth by the Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SERT and CNT Activations:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERT and CNT Assistance: SERT and CNT serve to provide tactical support to the Police Bureau. &nbsp;After reasonable efforts have been undertaken to resolve an incident, Bureau members may request SERT and CNT assistance to de-escalate an escalating situation, devise and implement re-engagement plans, or to decisively resolve an incident.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandatory Activation Situations:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all situations described below, SERT and CNT activation procedures shall be implemented after the On-Scene Incident Commander has gathered sufficient information to believe with a reasonable degree of certainty that one of the listed situation exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active Violence Incident:&nbsp; An incident involving an armed person(s) who has the ability and intent to use or has used deadly force on other persons and continues to do so while having unrestricted access to additional victims.&nbsp; These incidents include circumstances under which the threat of deadly force may include but are not limited to a suspect&rsquo;s use of knives, firearms, vehicles, and/or explosive devices.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High-Risk Search/Arrest warrant: Where there is a potential threat sufficient to require SERT and CNT to execute the warrant. Requests for SERT to execute warrants will be forwarded through channels along with a completed SERT Service Request &ndash; Planned Operations Risk Assessment Form.&nbsp; All SERT warrant plans require prior CIC approval and command during service.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the warrant service, SERT will attach and forward the original assessment form along with their After Action Report to the Chief of Police&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hostage Situation: An incident involving a person being held by a suspect who is reasonably believed to be armed, as a means of forcing compliance with some demand.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sniper Situation: A person, usually concealed, shooting or threatening to shoot at other people.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discretional Activation Situations:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all situations described below, activation procedures may be implemented for SERT and CNT, if Bureau members have undertaken reasonable efforts to resolve an incident and members are uncertain regarding the advisability of disengagement from the incident. &nbsp;Bureau members may consult with SERT, CNT and CIC to determine a course of action. &nbsp;If the CIC deems activation is appropriate, they will initiate the proper activation tier.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Barricaded Person: SERT and CNT response is required in cases where patrol or other units have exhausted reasonable efforts to resolve a barricade incident where a person uses an obstruction (e.g., building, car, etc.) with the threat of deadly force to accomplish a criminal goal such as avoiding capture, and a determination is made that the totality of circumstances do not support disengagement from the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Area Search for an Individual Armed with a Gun: SERT and CNT activation is required to support or assist patrol during incidents where a search is necessary for an armed individual(s) who has fled or is hiding from members in a respective area.&nbsp; Involved supervisors must evaluate whether effective containment of the suspect has likely been achieved within a suitable geographic area in order to conduct an area search.&nbsp; In cases where supervisors conclude that effective containment of the suspect is achieved, supervisors shall activate SERT and CNT to conduct the area search.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other requests or circumstances approved by the CIC.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; An On-Scene Incident Commander may contact and consult with the on-call CIC at any point during the incident.</p>
<p>2. Responsibilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations Branch: The Operations Branch has full responsibility for the Bureau&rsquo;s initial response to a field tactical situation. &nbsp;However, when SERT and/or CNT are called to a tactical operation, they shall be under the direct command of an Assistant Chief, as directed by the Chief of Police, for the duration of the incident.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CIC shall inform the designated Assistant Chief of all full deployments and the service of high-risk warrants as soon as it is practical to do so.&nbsp; The Assistant Chief will respond to the scene and assume command of full deployments and high-risk warrant service in the event that no CICs are available.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On-Scene Incident Commander: The On-Scene Incident Commander has the authority and responsibility for all police actions during the incident unless, or until, relieved by the CIC.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Critical Incident Commander: The CIC responds to all emergency SERT and CNT activations, warrants, and limited deployments. &nbsp;The CIC has the authority and responsibility for all police actions during an incident once they assume command from the On-Scene Incident Commander.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Precinct Commander: The Precinct Commander, or their designee, will respond to all activations, with the exception of high-risk warrant service.&nbsp; The Precinct Commander (or designee) will direct patrol resources in support of the event at the direction of the CIC. &nbsp;The Precinct Commander (or designee) will also manage precinct operations unrelated to the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Precinct Commander is the on-call CIC for the incident, the Precinct Commander shall designate a member to supervise the precinct response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event that all CICs are unavailable, the designated Assistant Chief be responsible for responding to and managing all emergency SERT/CNT activations, warrants, and limited deployments.&nbsp; In the event the Assistant Chief is unavailable, the Precinct Commander of the event location shall be responsible.&nbsp; If they are not available, the Precinct Commander closest geographically to the incident shall be responsible.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is determined that SERT and CNT are needed, that information shall be relayed to a supervisor (i.e., a member at the rank of sergeant or above) who can initiate an activation and immediately report to the scene, if not already present.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERT, CNT, and CIC activation procedures shall be implemented by the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) upon the order of a supervisor. &nbsp;The precinct of occurrence will be responsible for making all command notifications.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tactical functions, which shall be accomplished by the CIC, include:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment of the situation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assume command and communicate.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure adequate and appropriate resources are on-scene or en-route.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prioritize the objectives (e.g., life/safety, containment needs, end state, etc.).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Legal standing.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of the plan.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The plan and subsequent supporting missions are based on the above assessment.&nbsp; Continually re-evaluate as the call progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a command post that includes SERT, CNT, and Patrol command.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult with SERT, CNT, and Patrol when time allows.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication: &nbsp;Ensure that SERT, CNT, and Patrol all have the same situational awareness.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution of the mission.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate clear and specific missions to each resource.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly communicate the CIC&rsquo;s intent throughout the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate the results of each mission to maintain the same situational awareness by SERT, CNT, and Patrol.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.8.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displaced community members.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relief of members.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Designation of an off-site briefing post for City representatives.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public Information Officer (PIO): Coordinate media message and/or community notification.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.8.4.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-incident coordination.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the activation procedure has been initiated, SERT and CNT shall be on standby status until the On-Scene Incident Commander or the CIC directs them to perform in either their separate functions or as part of the operation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.10.&nbsp; SERT and CNT may be canceled only by the On-Scene Incident Commander or the CIC.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.11.&nbsp; The CIC (regardless of rank) has the authority and responsibility to direct all Bureau resources towards the situationally appropriate resolution of an incident and reports only to the designated Assistant Chief during activations.&nbsp; When time and circumstances permit, the CIC will consult with SERT about tactics, with CNT about negotiations, and with Patrol Command about resources. &nbsp;The CIC shall determine the objectives and approve the missions to meet those objectives of the operation, while the team leaders of each unit shall develop the specific tactics or strategies to effectively execute the missions.&nbsp; However, the CIC is ultimately responsible for the approval of tactics, negotiations and the allocation of resources. The CIC will direct SERT, CNT and Patrol resources.&nbsp; The CIC may, at any time, direct or stand down, tactical, negotiation, or patrol responses. &nbsp;SERT and CNT shall not take action independent from the CIC direction, except when a member reasonably believes that an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury exists or as part of being delegated Appropriate Initiative.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.12.&nbsp; Appropriate Initiative must meet the standard of having a high likelihood of success. This clearance to act should be used in limited circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;SERT and CNT must understand the CIC&rsquo;s intent.&nbsp; Members taking action under appropriate initiative must immediately communicate whether the action was successful. Appropriate Initiative is not a substitute for requesting permission for action when time allows.&nbsp; SERT and CNT supervisors and members assume responsibility for actions taken in the exercise of Appropriate Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Bureau Supervisors and Non-Police Bureau Personnel:<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bureau supervisors and City representatives not involved in the operation shall be directed to a location other than the command post, as designated by the CIC. &nbsp;The CIC will appoint one member as liaison to keep these observers apprised of any changes in conditions.</p>
<p>4. Outside Agency Coverage:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generally, outside agency tactical and negotiation teams are authorized to provide coverage when SERT and CNT are unavailable. In these situations, the on-call PPB CIC will respond and command the incident.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these circumstances, members should be aware that the conduct of the outside agency&rsquo;s officers is subject to their respective policies and procedures.</p>
<p>5. Outside Agency Requests:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside agency requests for full team SERT and CNT services within a 50-mile radius of Central Precinct must receive approval from the on-call CIC and the designated Assistant Chief.&nbsp; Requests for full team SERT and CNT assistance beyond the 50-mile radius must receive the approval of the Deputy Chief of Police or, if unavailable, the designated Assistant Chief. &nbsp;All such requests for full team SERT and CNT services that are approved require SERT and CNT command and the CIC to respond. &nbsp;The CIC will work with the agency lead assigned to command the incident and ensure that full team SERT and CNT resources are properly and safely utilized.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Special Weapons Use:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; SERT and RRT shall be responsible for developing and conducting annual special weapons qualification courses and for establishing qualification and familiarization standards for their respective teams.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of special weapons is restricted to SERT and RRT members who have successfully completed the special weapons qualification course within the last twelve months, as required by SERT and RRT training policy.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Training Division shall be responsible for maintaining complete training records of participating SERT and RRT members.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The SERT team leader shall decide when special weapons shall be carried by SERT members in an emergency police action; however, absent exigent circumstances, the use of special weapons shall be determined by the CIC.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Policy: </strong></strong></p>
<p>1. The Portland Police Bureau (PPB) has adopted the National Incident Management System (NIMS), as developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to ensure effective and efficient emergency response management for various threats and hazards, as well as planned and unplanned events.&nbsp; NIMS provides the framework for how the PPB works with all levels of government, non-governmental and private sector organizations, across jurisdictions to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from an incident. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. PPB will utilize the Incident Command System (ICS), including incident action planning for both planned and unplanned events. &nbsp;Consistent with the ICS, the Bureau will scale its incident management based on the size of the event, from a routine police response to a larger or more complex incident, such as a protest or natural emergency/disaster.&nbsp; An Incident Action Plan (IAP) provides a concise and consistent means of capturing and communicating overall incident priorities, objectives, strategies, and tactics for both operational and support activities. &nbsp;Incidents must have an action plan. However, not all incidents require a written plan. &nbsp;Most initial response operations are not captured with a formal IAP; however, if an incident is likely to extend beyond one operational period, become more complex, or involve multiple jurisdictions and or agencies, preparing a written IAP will become increasingly important to maintain effective, efficient, and safe operations.&nbsp; Using ICS for all incidents or planned events helps members improve and maintain the skills needed for the large-scale incidents.</p>
<p>3. PPB members shall be required to know the principles of ICS and complete the necessary training commensurate with their rank and position.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Felony Arrests:</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following procedures shall apply when felony arrests are made by sworn members of the Bureau who are not assigned to the Detective Division (Detectives) or other investigative unit (e.g. precinct detective, GET detectives, etc.):</p>
<p>1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Felony Processing: Persons arrested on Measure 11 felonies will be transported to the appropriate investigative unit, unless directed otherwise by the investigative unit. A detective supervisor will be notified immediately upon arrival.</p>
<p>1.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions:</p>
<p>1.1.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug Arrests: All felony drug arrests, regardless of classification, will be processed by the arresting member. When circumstances such as quantity of illegal substances, willingness of the suspect to cooperate with the authorities or any unusual aspects of the case make Drugs and Vice Division (DVD) involvement desirable, the arresting member will contact his or her supervisor. If it is determined that DVD involvement would be beneficial, the supervisor will contact a DVD supervisor via phone, or the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) call-up, to discuss the feasibility and degree of DVD involvement. Arrestees exposed to hazardous materials will be decontaminated at the scene prior to any transport. For proper decontamination procedures, see Directive 640.13, Drug Lab Procedures.</p>
<p>1.1.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Related Arrests: Individuals involved as felony suspects or possible suspects in vehicular collision cases (vehicular assault, manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide, hit and run) will be processed under the provisions of Directive 640.50, Traffic Crash Investigations and Directive 860.10, Traffic Citations and Arrests.</p>
<p>1.1.1.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Warrant Arrests: Fugitives arrested on warrants from outside agencies will be taken to the booking facility, unless there is an immediate need for a detective interview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Class C Felony Arrests:&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Class C felony arrests will be processed by the arresting member. When unique aspects of the situation make Detective Division involvement desirable, the arresting member will contact his or her supervisor. If it is determined that Detective Division involvement would be beneficial, the supervisor will contact the Detective Division supervisor via phone, or the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) call-up, to discuss the feasibility and degree of Detective Division involvement. Arrestees exposed to hazardous materials will be decontaminated at the scene prior to any transport. For proper decontamination procedures, see Directive 640.13, Drug Lab Procedures.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;In those cases where it is determined that an immediate interview by Detectives would serve no constructive purpose, or the suspect has requested an attorney, or is generally uncooperative and unruly, arresting members will process the case noting the names of the patrol supervisor and/or detective supervisor who reviewed the arrest in their report. Detectives must be contacted prior to booking any Measure 11 suspect, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Mandatory Booking:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;ORS &sect; 181.511 and ORS &sect; 181.515, mandate that all arrested felony suspects be photographed and fingerprinted upon arrest. If the suspect is not transported to an investigative unit or division, the arresting member will lodge the suspect in Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC) or cite and release them under the provisions of Directive 860.30, Citations-in-Lieu-of-Custody (C-Cite or Z-Cite), after they have been photographed and fingerprinted.</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;All members arresting persons for auto theft charges (e.g. unauthorized use of a motor vehicle - UUMV) will book those prisoners into the Justice Center Jail. C-Cites will not be issued without a supervisor&rsquo;s approval.</p>
<p class=""Default"">&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Questioning and Interviewing: <em></em></p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notify a supervisor at once upon bringing a suspect to a precinct, unit, or division for questioning.</p>
<p>4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member who transports a suspect to an investigative unit or division will not leave the suspect unattended in a holding cell without first notifying a supervisor or, in the absence of a supervisor, any on duty sworn member of the investigative unit. The transporting member will provide the suspect&rsquo;s name, charge and a brief statement of the circumstances. The supervisor or member who has been notified is responsible for monitoring the suspect until relieved.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Detectives chain of command will, as soon as possible, assign a detective to assist the arresting member, conduct a formal interview of the suspect, and complete the necessary phases of the investigation.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arresting member will remain until released by the investigator(s). The member may be requested to assist in the investigation.</p>
<p>4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arresting member will write the required reports prior to leaving Detectives. Once the reports are reviewed by a detective or investigating member or supervisor, copies will be left with Detectives.</p>
<p>4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a defendant is charged with a crime and issued a traffic citation arising out of one incident, the citation will be placed in the envelope and a copy of the traffic citation(s) will be attached to all copies of the report.</p>
<p>4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the responsibility of Detectives to arrange transportation to the booking facility for those adults brought to Detectives. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Reporting:</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members: When felony arrests are not processed through an investi&shy;gative unit or division, arresting members will complete all reports as required in Directive 910.00, Field Reporting Handbook Instructions. The arresting officer will prepare a case envelope and deliver, or arrange for its delivery, to the Complaint Signer prior to 1000 hours the next court day. After copies are made, the original reports and photocopies of citations (or unneeded originals) will be forwarded to the Records Division.</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives will ensure that all felony arrests within their area of re&shy;sponsibility are processed completely and forwarded to the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office by 1000 hours the next court day.</p>

<p><strong>Definitions: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Juvenile Non-Offender/Protective Custody: An abused, neglected, or dependent juvenile who may be temporarily detained for his or her own safety or welfare. This includes a juvenile taken into protective custody when conditions or surroundings reasonably appear to jeopardize the juvenile's welfare or when it reasonably appears the juvenile has run away from home in accordance with ORS &sect; 419B.150.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Juvenile Offender twelve (12) years of age and over: A juvenile twelve (12) years of age and over who is alleged to have committed an offense that would subject an adult to arrest (a non-status offense). It also includes a juvenile who possesses a handgun in violation of ORS &sect; 166.250. 28 CFR 31.303.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Juvenile Offender under twelve (12) years of age: A juvenile under twelve (12) years of age who is alleged to have committed a serious violent offense requires consultation with the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) prior to taking the juvenile into custody.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Juvenile Status Offender: A juvenile who is charged with or who has committed an offense that would not be criminal if committed by an adult (e.g. truancy, curfew, runaway, possession and/or consumption of tobacco products and/or alcohol), yet may be taken into protective custody for purpose of reuniting the juvenile with a parent, guardian, or other responsible person.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Substantial threat to safety: A substantial threat to safety means an articulable opportunity for directed aggression in order for temporary detention to be permissible. For example, a juvenile with flailing limbs or breaking property may not pose a substantial threat, while a juvenile with flailing limbs, access to weapons, and the intent to harm self, others, animals, or members may pose a substantial threat.<strong style=""font-size: 1.1em;"">&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In this Directive, the Portland Police Bureau distinguishes between temporary detention and Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) custody of juveniles under twelve (12) years of age and juveniles twelve (12) years of age and over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Portland Police Bureau recognizes the inherent dignity of every person, including the youth in our community, whose needs differ from those of adults. The Bureau understands that giving members the authority to temporarily detain juveniles or place juveniles into custody and take them to Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) to protect the public welfare creates an obligation to guide members as they balance important social and individual interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that duty may require members to temporarily detain or place juveniles into custody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Bureau also recognizes that temporary detention or custody may have lasting impact on the individuals involved and may impact the community at large.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It is the intention of the Bureau to accomplish its mission as effectively as possible while detaining juveniles only for as long as reasonably necessary for safe processing, transfer, and release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Because the Bureau places high value on providing a positive influence towards youth, the Bureau is dedicated to providing training and resources that help members effectively engage juveniles.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class=""Pa5""><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Temporary Detention &ndash; Juveniles under twelve (12) years of age:</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles under twelve (12) years of age may be temporarily detained when the juvenile presents a substantial threat to safety. Substantial threat to safety must involve an articulable opportunity for directed aggression in order for temporary detention to be permissible. If a member temporarily detains a juvenile under twelve (12) years of age, the member must notify their on duty supervisor and document such details within reports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Custody to Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) &ndash; Juveniles under twelve (12) years of age:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;No youth under twelve (12) years of age shall be placed into custody and taken to the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) except for serious, violent crimes. If a member believes a juvenile under twelve (12) years of age should be taken into custody the member must confer with their on duty supervisor; the member and the supervisor together will confer with the on duty supervisor at the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) to confirm authorization and plan next steps before taking action. Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) staff may consult with a judge about the particular circumstances involved so as to plan next steps with the Bureau.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Custody to Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) &ndash; Juveniles twelve (12) years of age and over:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A member may place a juvenile twelve (12)&nbsp; years of age and over into custody and take them to the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) in the following circumstances, per ORS &sect; 419.C.080:</p>
<p>3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When, if the youth were an adult, the youth could be arrested without a warrant; or</p>
<p>3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a warrant exists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Measure 11 &ndash; Juveniles fifteen (15), sixteen (16), and seventeen (17) years of age:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probable Cause Custody:</p>
<p>4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members Responsibilities:</p>
<p>4.1.1.1.&nbsp; Transport juveniles to Detectives for processing.</p>
<p>4.1.1.2.&nbsp; As per adult arrests, a weekend probable cause affidavit may be required.</p>
<p>4.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detectives Procedures.</p>
<p>4.1.2.1.&nbsp; The juvenile will be brought to Detectives for interview and/or processing.</p>
<p>4.1.2.2.&nbsp; Detectives will be responsible to coordinate completion of reports, and fingerprinting and photographing with the Forensic Evidence Division (FED), in accordance with Directive 640.70, Fingerprinting and Photographing of Juveniles. Additionally, Detectives shall confer with the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) regarding timing of necessary reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Juveniles Secure Custody: &nbsp;</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A juvenile cannot be held in police detention for more than five (5) hours. ORS &sect; 419C.130. If a juvenile is in detention for four (4) hours, an on duty supervisor must be notified.</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles under twelve (12) years of age shall not be handcuffed unless they present a heightened risk to safety, meaning they are combative or threatening.</p>
<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles twelve (12) years of age and over may be handcuffed as adults.</p>
<p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;A juvenile shall not be handcuffed to a fixed rail or object.</p>
<p>5.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles under twelve (12) years of age and juvenile status offenders shall not be placed in a locked room unless a risk to juvenile or member safety can be documented. 42 USC &sect; 5633.</p>
<p>5.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juveniles shall be temporarily detained only in quarters with sight and sound separation; meaning members will locate or arrange a juvenile within Bureau facilities so as to prevent physical, visual, or auditory contact between the juvenile and adults.</p>
<p>5.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;A notation shall be made in the police report listing the duration of detention and if the juvenile was handcuffed.</p>
<p>5.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;A staff member of the same sex shall supervise personal hygiene activities and care, such as changing clothing or using the restroom, without direct observation to allow for privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Juveniles Custody Log:</p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any time a juvenile is held in custody at a Bureau facility, the custody shall be promptly and properly documented in the Juvenile Custody Log.</p>
<p>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;All Bureau locations that have secure holding facilities shall maintain a Juvenile Secure Custody Log form for each holding room.</p>
<p>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;All members who place a juvenile in a secure holding facility/room are required to legibly complete all categories on the room&rsquo;s Juvenile Secure Custody Log.</p>
<p>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile Custody Logs must be completed at any security holding facility to which the juvenile is taken (e.g. juvenile held at North Precinct, before being taken to Forensic Evidence Division.)</p>
<p>6.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;All original Juvenile Security Logs completed will be maintained at the secure holding facility they originated at for five (5) years from the date of the last entry on the log.</p>
<p>6.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of completed Juvenile Security Logs will be forwarded to the Office of the Chief of Police, Operations Branch Chief, by the 15<sup>th</sup> of January, and 15<sup>th</sup> of July, each year for the prior six (6) months reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Misdemeanor/Status Offenders:</p>
<p>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Misdemeanor/status offenses include: MIP, curfew, truancy, City ordinance violations, non-person-to-person misdemeanors, and circumstances or situations that may endanger the juvenile&rsquo;s welfare or the welfare of others.</p>
<p>7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Juvenile status offenders should generally be released by citation or with warning rather than taken into temporary custody. Members may take custody of a juvenile status offender in order to facilitate reunification. Juveniles ages twelve (12) to seventeen (17) will be released to a parent, guardian, or other responsible person if possible. If such a person is not available, juveniles will be taken to the Juvenile Reception Center (Janus) or other approved placement.</p>
<p>7.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;In all cases a report will be completed prior to leaving duty. Facts related to attempts to locate and release juveniles to a parent, guardian, or other responsible person will be documented in the report. When a juvenile is transported to the Juvenile Reception Center (Janus), a copy of the completed report will be left with staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Remanded Offenders: &nbsp;</p>
<p>8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remanded offenders are juveniles who have been permanently remanded to the adult court. Even though a juvenile has been on adult probation and remanded by adult court, juveniles are not to be transported to adult facilities. Instead, members will transport juveniles to the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH).&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Protective Custody: ORS &sect; 419B.150-419B.175</p>
<p>9.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective Custody: Members may take a juvenile into protective custody when the juvenile is found to be a victim of abuse, neglect, found in the company of arrested persons, and/or in need of care for non-criminal/non-status related offenses, such as runaway and missing juveniles.</p>
<p>9.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Protective Custody Placement: Excluding runaway situations, protective custody placements are arranged through the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS) Child Abuse 24-hour Hotline. Reports of this nature will not contain the location, address, or phone number of the placement.</p>
<p>9.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placement of Runaway Juveniles: When a juvenile is taken into protective custody as a runaway, members will release the juvenile without unnecessary delay to the custody of the juvenile&rsquo;s parent or guardian, or to the Juvenile Reception Center (Janus), or other approved placement. Members may release the juvenile to the Juvenile Reception Center (Janus) or other approved placement if it reasonably appears that the child would not willingly remain at home if released to the juvenile&rsquo;s parent or guardian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Illness, Injury or Intoxication:</p>
<p>10.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any juvenile showing visible signs of illness, injury, or intoxication must be medi&shy;cally screened at an approved medical facility before admission will be allowed at the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) and/or Juvenile Reception Center (Janus).&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Notification of Parent or Guardian:</p>
<p>11.1.&nbsp; As soon as practicable after a juvenile is taken into custody a member shall notify the juvenile&rsquo;s parent, guardian or other person responsible for the juvenile. ORS &sect; 419C.097.</p>
<p>11.2.&nbsp; In the absence of actual contact with the person responsible for the juvenile, written notification will be left at the juvenile&rsquo;s residence if known.</p>
<p>11.3.&nbsp; When notification attempts fail, members will document such in his or her reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Notification of Victims or Complainants:</p>
<p>12.1.&nbsp; Victims and/or complainants are not required to sign complaints against juveniles. Members need only notify victims and/or complainants that a representative of the juvenile court system will contact them regarding their case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; Report Disposition: &nbsp;</p>
<p>13.1.&nbsp; The member taking custody of a juvenile is responsible for completing an applicable report(s). When juveniles are presented to Detectives for final disposition, a copy of these reports must accompany the juvenile.</p>
<p>13.2.&nbsp; If juveniles are to be lodged in the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) or placed in protective custody (medical emergency, shelter care or placement with family or friend other than parent or guardian), all reports related to the case must be delivered to the Juvenile Detention Hall (JDH) prior to the end of the member&rsquo;s shift.</p>
<p>13.3.&nbsp; In those instances when a juvenile is released all reports related to the case will be forwarded to the Multnomah County Juvenile Services Division.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>POLICY (825.10)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau considers domestic violence to be a very serious issue and will treat all reports of member involved domestic violence with a full and complete investigative process.</p>
<p>Domestic violence crimes have serious and long lasting detrimental effects. Members are not immune from becoming involved in domestic violence situations as either a perpetrator or victim. Members who have concerns about their behavior or display behaviors that raise concern are encouraged to seek assistance. Some available sources of assistance are a friend, supervisor, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), or private mental health care provider.</p>
<p>Behaviors that may raise concern include, but are not limited to, frequent tardiness and absences, an increase in controlling behaviors, stalking and inappropriate surveillance activity, complaints from co-worker, unwarranted aggression and verbal abuse, increased use of physical force and/or injury.</p>
<p>Any Bureau member who reasonably suspects that an act of domestic violence has been committed by a Bureau member is required to report the incident through one of the following channels:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Reporting member&rsquo;s shift supervisor.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Reporting member&rsquo;s RU manager.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Branch chief.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Personnel Division manager.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Family Services Division (FSD) manager.</p>
<p>Members are authorized to make notifications outside their chain of command or to any of the above listed managers. Any manager who receives notification of a criminal complaint against a member will ensure the FSD manager is immediately notified. A disclosure on the part of any officer, intimate partner, or family member, to any Bureau member will be treated as an admission or report of a crime and shall be investigated both criminally and internally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (825.10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Domestic violence: Abusive behavior that is physical, sexual, and/or psychological, intended to establish control over a family or household member and is prohibited by law.</p>
<p>Household and family members: Spouses, former spouses, adult persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, persons cohabitating, or who have cohabitated, persons who have been sexually intimate with each other within two (2) years (including same sex relationships), and persons who are unmarried parents of a child.</p>
<p>Restraining orders: Any court order restricting or prohibiting a person&rsquo;s contact with another person or persons, and/or restricting where and when a person may be at a location. Such an order may also result in restricting possession of firearms and ammunition. This includes, but is not limited to, Restraining Orders, No Contact Orders, Protective Orders, and Anti-Harassment Orders. This court mandated restrictions are designed to aid in the safety of the petitioner (person who files for the restraining order). In Oregon, the order is subject to appeal within thirty (30) days of being served. Once an appeal is requested the court must hear the appeal within twenty one (21) days, or within five (5) days of contesting a custody provision (not parenting time).</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reported Domestic Violence (825.10)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member as victim situations:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When the crime occurs within the Domestic Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s (DVRU) jurisdiction, the DVRU will be responsible for the follow-up investigation.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Responding Bureau officers shall notify their supervisor when they are at a scene where a member has been victimized by domestic violence. The supervisor shall contact the FSD manager who shall assign a response team to come to the scene to assist in the initial investigation. After regular office hours the FSD manager will be contacted through BOEC.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;When the crime occurs outside DVRU&rsquo;s area of jurisdiction, the responding agency may contact DVRU for assistance.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When the FSD learns of an outside jurisdiction report of domestic violence, it will offer assistance to the investigating agency and serve as the liaison with that agency for the term of the investigation as appropriate.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since domestic violence perpetrators are likely to know when and where the victim works, they commonly continue the harassing and victimizing behavior while the victim is at their place of work. When appropriate, RU managers may offer to adjust such things as works hours, workstations, and telephone contact numbers of domestic violence victims to prevent further victimization. When appropriate, this information shall be forwarded to the Personnel Division (Personnel).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Member as suspect situations:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the crime occurs within the DVRU&rsquo;s jurisdiction, the Investigations Branch chief will have the responsibility to assign the investigation of the reported domestic violence. This investigation will be complete, to include an interview with the suspected member.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bureau officers arriving at a scene where a member has been accused/suspected of domestic violence or served with a restraining order shall notify the member&rsquo;s supervisor as well as their own supervisor.&nbsp; The responding officer&rsquo;s supervisor will respond to the scene and direct the initial investigation until the arrival of a DVRU supervisor. The patrol supervisor will contact the FSD manager who will assign an investigator to come to the scene. After regular office hours, the FSD manager will be contacted through BOEC. &nbsp;If BOEC is aware that the call involves a Bureau member, the call will be coded a priority 2 and a supervisor will be dispatched in addition to responding officers. Responding officers will request a supervisor of a higher rank than the involved officer regardless of the involved officer&rsquo;s jurisdiction, if possible.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;If probable cause exists for a crime related to domestic violence, an arrest will be made at the scene, including harassment.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;If probably cause exists and the offender has left the scene, the on-scene supervisor will exhaust every reasonable means to locate the alleged offender.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;If the victim has left the scene, the on-scene supervisor will preserve any evidence at the scene and make every reasonable effort to follow through on the investigation, including proper notifications.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp; In the event of an on-scene arrest, the FSD manager or his designee will seize all Bureau property including firearms.</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;In the event of an on-scene arrest, the on-scene supervisor will inquire whether the victim wants any additional firearms removed for safekeeping.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp; The FSD manager or his/her designee will offer the victim access to a domestic violence advocate.</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;The FSD manager will appoint a person to act as the victim&rsquo;s point of contact within the Bureau.&nbsp;&nbsp; That contact, preferably a member of the command staff, will help keep the victim apprised of the investigative process and will ensure the Bureau&rsquo;s compliance with this directive as well as relevant FSD/SOPs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If officers determine that the suspect is an officer from an outside agency, they will notify their supervisor, who will respond and direct the investigation. &nbsp;The supervisor will contact the suspect officer&rsquo;s agency and arrange for a contact.&nbsp; DVRU will respond at the request of the on-scene supervisor and conduct the investigation. &nbsp;The services of a domestic violence advocate will be offered to the victim and will be arranged through DVRU.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sworn members arrested for a domestic violence crime or served with a restraining order will not be allowed to return to work until he/ she has been cleared by a psychological threat assessment.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a Bureau member is arrested as a result of involvement in a domestic violence incident, the member shall notify his/her immediate supervisor at the earliest possible time. The supervisor shall notify the RU manager and FSD manager. If the action is taken by an outside agency, the FSD supervisor shall contact the investigating agency to offer assistance and serve as a liaison to the investigating agency. &nbsp;If the investigating agency does not have access to victim services (i.e., DV advocate), a FSD representative will volunteer the use of a FSD domestic violence victim advocate.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;The Investigations Branch chief shall be contacted as soon as possible by FSD regarding member involved domestic violence cases, and kept appraised as to the criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Duty Status (825.10)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Ongoing criminal investigation: Members who are subject to a criminal investigation will have their duty status administered by Personnel, for the period of investigation and psychological threat assessment, in accordance with Bureau policies, member rights, and contractual requirements.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;IAD investigation: Members who are subject to an IAD investigation will have their duty status administered by their RU manager and/or Personnel, for the period of investigation, in accordance with Bureau policies, member rights, and contractual requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Restraining Orders (825.10)</strong></p>
<p>Members who are subject to a restraining order shall notify their immediate supervisor at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>Federal law prohibits any respondent (person who has had a restraining order served on them) from possessing firearms and ammunition (actual or constructive possession) if the restraining order bans such possession or he/she is found to represent a credible threat to the petitioner. There is a military and law enforcement exemption for sworn members, on-duty status only. However, a restraining order that bans the respondent&rsquo;s possession of firearms and ammunition may still be subject to enforcement under state law, unless the respondent has received relief for that portion of the restraining order in state court.</p>
<p>Sworn members who have state liability of a restraining order restricting firearms and ammunition possession, and all non-sworn members subject to such a restraining order, shall not be allowed to work or be in areas where actual or constructive possession of firearms and/or ammunition is possible. If the officer/respondent is appealing a restraining order with firearm and ammunition prohibition, the officer may be placed on administrative leave or in a position where there is no contact with the public through the duration of the appeal.</p>
<p>Members, who are subject to restraining orders that have firearm and ammunition restrictions, shall ensure all firearms and ammunition are removed from their residence, Bureau locker, and any other location he/she would have actual or constructive possession of such items. This must be done immediately. If the restraining order is appealed, and as a result of that appeal, the firearm and ammunition restrictions of the restraining order are eliminated, or the restraining order is vacated, the member may have returned to his/her possession any and all firearms and ammunition that were removed.</p>
<p>If a sworn member qualifies for the federal exemption and does not have state liability of a restraining order banning firearms and ammunition possession, FSD will create a report covering the circumstances of the restraining order and forward the report, through channels, to the Performance Review Board (PRB) (See DIR 341.00 for membership of the PRB.). The PRB will make a recommendation to the Chief of Police regarding what accommodation, if any; the Bureau should make for the firearm restriction. If directed by the Chief of Police, the employee&rsquo;s shift commander or designee will issue the officer&rsquo;s duty firearm(s) and ammunition to him/her at the beginning of each work shift, and collect the firearm(s) and ammunition at the end of each shift. The firearm(s) and ammunition will be stored in a manner that does not allow actual or constructive possession by the officer when he/she is off duty. The Bureau will not facilitate or allow a sworn member to work under the federal exemption until he/she has been cleared by a psychological threat assessment. Since restraining orders are twelve (12) months in duration, and may be extended, duty status could include termination.</p>
<p>Members who have been arrested or convicted of a domestic violence crime&nbsp;shall notify their immediate supervisor at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>An annual check of every member&rsquo;s law enforcement record, including, but not limited to CCH, shall be done by the FSD to check for domestic violence arrests, convictions and restraining orders. Any domestic violence arrest, conviction or restraining order found as a result of such a check will be forwarded to the appropriate RU manager, Personnel, and IAD.</p>
<p>Federal law prohibits persons convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor from actually or constructively possessing firearms and ammunition. There is no exemption to this law. A member convicted of a domestic violence crime, whether or not it meets federal standards, shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSIBILITY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTROL (825.10)</strong></p>
<p>The FSD manager or designee will review officer reports and calls for service, and will conduct yearly law enforcement record checks for all Bureau members, making appropriate notifications as outlined in this directive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (880.30) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Warrant Arrests</strong></p>
<p>On warrant arrests, security deposits will be set as stated on the face of the warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warrantless Arrests (880.30)</strong></p>
<p>On warrantless arrests, members will indicate the security deposit amount on their reports and/or citations in the amount specified by the Circuit Court security deposit schedule in effect at the time of the arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Extraordinary Security Deposit Setting (880.30)</strong></p>
<p>Under no circumstances will a member set security deposit amounts greater than those specified on the court bail schedule, or on a warrant, unless he/she first receives specific approval from a judge of the Circuit Court. A listing of judges who may be contacted is available in both the DVD and Detective Divisions.</p>
<p>If a member has reason to believe that the security deposit listed on the court schedule is not sufficient, he/she may contact a judge to request an increase for security deposit needed in a particular case.</p>
<p>The purpose of a request for an extraordinary security deposit setting is to ensure that the suspect will appear at future court proceedings. The increased security deposit request must be based upon the member&rsquo;s knowledge of the suspect&rsquo;s financial status when arrested, as well as related implications (i.e., the possession of large sums of money and/or large quantities of controlled substances imply easy access to large amounts of cash and/or influential associates). The suspect&rsquo;s past court appearance history may also be taken into account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting (880.30)</strong></p>
<p>When extraordinary security deposit settings are granted, members will write Extraordinary Bail on the top of the custody report. The narrative will contain the name of the granting judge.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531677

<p><strong>POLICY (880.20)</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau will cooperate with court procedures so as not to jeopardize or compromise cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (880.20)</strong></p>
<p>State statutes allow for service of criminal and civil case subpoenas to designated individuals in a police agency. The designated individual is the Court Coordinator. The Court Coordinator will accept only those subpoenas where there are ten days or more prior to the scheduled appearance date. If a subpoena is to be served with less than ten days notification, it will be personally served on the member (not to precinct desk clerks or command). Subpoenas served in either manner are legally served. Verification of appearance via PPDS/MDC still applies. Members may be held in contempt-of-court for non-appearance and/or be subject to discipline.</p>
<p>The Records Division (Records) is the only RU authorized to respond to subpoenas for police reports or PPDS records. Members receiving subpoenas for reports or PPDS records will immediately forward the subpoena to Records.</p>
<p>The Strategic Services Division (SSD) responds to subpoenas for Directives and other Bureau-wide policies and procedures.</p>
<p>The Court Coordinator&rsquo;s office cannot accept service of civil summons or civil complaints. Personal service is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Subpoena: Criminal and Traffic Court (880.20)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat complaints, subpoenas, summons and court appearance notices for criminal and traffic court as official notice and documentation mandating court appearance. These notices will generally be communicated via PPDS/MDC. However, there will be times when a subpoena will be personally served (i.e., short notice defense subpoena). When such personal service takes place, members will notify the Court Coordinator within hours of it, via phone, fax, or inter-office mail.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Check his/her court schedule, through PPDS/MDC, every working day. Most of the time, members will not receive a hard copy subpoena. What is on the PPDS/MDC screen is the trial notification and schedule.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Verify, through PPDS/MDC, the necessity for the court appearance after 1600 hours the day prior to the scheduled appearance. If the status space is blank, it is the member&rsquo;s responsibility to check again after 1800 hours and continue to check until the status is updated.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notify the Court Coordinator within 72 hours of the member&rsquo;s first notification of an impending change in shift, days off, assignment, home telephone number, off-duty disability, leave of absence status, etc.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Court unavailability requests:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; Attend court while on paid disability, unless specifically prohibited by physician&rsquo;s orders.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Court unavailability requests cannot always be granted. A judge may require a court appearance during a scheduled vacation or other leave, even if a court unavailability notice has been sent in. The DA is committed to try and accommodate these requests when properly informed and notified. Members should consider that the greater the number of members involved in a court case, the greater the complication for the court in scheduling cases without interfering with requests for court unavailability.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Notify the Court Coordinator as soon as possible of pending unavailability due to absence from work for any reason. Thirty-day advance notice is required. Lesser notification time reduces the chance of receiving a set over. Members must request unavailability even if there is a chance the leave or vacation will be canceled or not needed. Verify the unavailability has been entered into PPDS after the fifth day of the Court Coordinator&rsquo;s notification. If it has not been entered, contact the Court Coordinator. If unavailability is due to illness, notify the Court Coordinator when available again.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;Short notice of unavailability for court, 30 days or less, requires the member to:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Notify the Court Coordinator by phone. The Court Coordinator will document the request in PPDS.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Call each subpoena clerk (number under Court Schedule in PPDS) who has sent a subpoena for the time period of unavailability and ask for the set over. The set over is not automatic and approval must be received from the Deputy District Attorney.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Notify the Court Coordinator as soon as possible of pending unavailability.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Illness: Notify the Court Coordinator as soon as possible. After regular business hours, leave a message on the Court Coordinator&rsquo;s voice mail with name, DPSST number and anticipated date of return.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Traffic Court: The Court Coordinator will process Traffic Court set over requests. To request a set over, notify the Court Coordinator by phone. The request must include the reason for the set over request and must be received at the Court Coordinator a minimum of 14 days in advance of the trial date or a set over will not be accepted and no request will be made. Most Traffic Court cases are subpoenaed as far as three months before the trial date. The earlier the set over request is made the greater the likelihood it will be granted. If the traffic court case has been set over once before, the judge has to grant the set over request the day of the trial. The Court Coordinator will document the set over request in PPDS.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Overtime Report.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete a Court Related Overtime Report for all court-related overtime. A separate overtime report is required for each day of court. This includes time stamping the arrival and departure times at the Multnomah County Court House. If for some reason this is not done, an inter-office memorandum must be submitted, along with the overtime report, explaining the circumstances for not doing so. At court facilities without time stamp machines, members will sign in and out of the facility sign-up log, writing the times on the report with an explanation of why not stamped.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Submit the overtime report(s) in the manner outlined in DIR 210.30, Timekeeping Procedure. b. &nbsp;Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Immediately notify the Court Coordinator&rsquo;s office if any of the following circumstances occur to a member:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Becomes disabled on the job.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Takes an emergency leave.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Placed on administrative leave (i.e., traumatic incidents, shootings, etc.).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Forward the unavailability notice and, when appropriate, accompanying documents (i.e., military orders, disability orders, parental leave documents, etc.) to the Court Coordinator&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Sign the court overtime report and forward to Fiscal Services (Fiscal) for verification.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;RU Manager Responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Upon receipt of a No-show Notice for court, determine the reason for the non-compliance and take appropriate action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Civil Subpoenas (880.20)</strong></p>
<p>Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Treat civil subpoenas as official notice or documentation mandating court appearance.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Civil subpoenas served via PPDS/MDC are to be treated as all other PPDS court notifications.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Members who receive personally served work related civil subpoenas will:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Within 24 hours of receipt of the civil subpoena, attach a memorandum listing date, time and manner of service and forward a copy to the Court Coordinator.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Personally advise the issuing court or attorney if unable to attend court on the indicated date.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If three or less days to the scheduled court date, contact the Court Coordinator as soon as possible via phone.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Forward a copy of the civil subpoena with the overtime report to Fiscal for verification.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;If a member receives a witness fee or mileage allowance for a court appearance related to the performance of law enforcement duties, the fee will be forwarded to Fiscal.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Members who receive a subpoena for police reports or PPDS records will, in addition to the requirements above, forward a copy to Records. Records is the only RU authorized to respond to subpoenas for police reports or PPDS records.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531668

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Constitutional Rights Advice (Miranda) Form (Detectives)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (870.90)</strong></p>
<p>A suspect in a crime must be advised of his/her Miranda rights, prior to questioning about the crime, if the suspect is in custody or is not free to go. Custody means actual constraint of the person or a person in a situation where a reasonable person would think that he/she is not free to go. In addition, such warnings may be required in circumstances that, although they do not rise to the level of full custody, create a setting which judges would and members should recognize to be compelling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (870.90)</strong></p>
<p>Patrol members who have advised suspects of their Constitutional Rights (Miranda) and then transported them to the Detective Division (Detectives), or other investigative unit, for further questioning, must inform the assigned detective of the time, date, and place of the advisal, to include any response made by the suspect(s). The member who actually advised the defendant will write a report indicating the time, date, and place where such rights were given. If the defendant invokes his rights, the member should notify the appropriate investigative unit to determine if transport for questioning is still desired.</p>
<p>The member should not question the suspect if in the member&rsquo;s judgment the interview is best performed by a detective. If the member believes the interview should be conducted by a detective, it is the responsibility of the member to contact Detectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constitutional Rights Advice (Miranda) Form (870.90)</strong></p>
<p>When feasible, the form will be used when a suspect is in police custody or when the suspect is interviewed at the police station and is not free to leave.</p>
<p>Prior to questioning, read the Miranda rights to the suspect. If the suspect speaks only a foreign language, the Constitutional Rights Advice (Miranda) form must be in that language. The Language Line may be used. For hearing impaired, the Oregon Telecommunications Relay Services can provide signing services, or the hearing impaired may read and sign a rights advice form. If a signer or translator is used, the member will get the name, address and telephone number of that person and advise the translator or signer to document the transaction for future legal needs. The phone numbers for the Language Line and the Oregon Telecommunications Relay Services are available in the Problem Solving Resource Guide.</p>
<p>Ask the person if they understand what his/her rights are and answer any questions they have.</p>
<p>Have the person sign the form indicating they understand their rights.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;If the suspect signs the form but refuses to make a written statement, an oral statement may be taken. A notation will be made on the statement portion of the form that the suspect did make an oral statement. The oral statement will be incorporated into the investigating member&rsquo;s report. Oral statements may be tape recorded if the member informs the suspect prior to recording or if the suspect consents. Recordings will be processed as evidence and summarized in the member&rsquo;s report. Verbatim transcriptions will be made when required by the investigation and/or the prosecution.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If the suspect is not willing to waive rights, any further questioning will cease. Threats or false promises designed to persuade the suspect to waive his/her rights are forbidden. If the suspect initiates conversation after invoking rights, he/she should be asked if he/she is now willing to waive those rights. Unless an affirmative answer is given, those statements may not be admissible. Continued questions after a suspect requests an attorney will result in all statements being unusable as evidence. If the suspect is willing to make a statement, but refuses to sign the form, a notation will be made that he/she was advised of rights but refused to sign. This notation will be witnessed.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; All copies of the rights forms will be sent to the Record Division (Records) as part of the permanent case record.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;All original rights forms are to be placed into evidence and sent to the property room.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531664

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disposition of Prisoners&rsquo; Animals (870.40)</strong></p>
<p>When a person is arrested in their home and has a domestic animal, the animal should be left in the home. When a person is arrested at a location other than their home (i.e., auto, motel room) and has a domestic animal with them:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the arrestee requests and the person is reasonably available, members may allow another person to take responsibility for the animal.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; When no caretaker is available, members may release an animal to Animal Control (or their contractee).</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;When Animal Control (or their contractee) is not reasonably available, and the animal is of a size appropriate to the Central Precinct animal holding cage, members may take custody of an animal and process it into Central Precinct&rsquo;s animal holding cage (pursuant to Central Precinct&rsquo;s SOP).</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The key to the animal holding cage may be obtained from Central Precinct desk clerk.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The impounding member will lock the animal in the cage, located on LL2. Before leaving the animal, the member will ensure the cage is clean and fresh water is available.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The impounding member will fill out the Impounded Animal Form (available at Central Precinct desk). The form will be attached to a copy of the first page of the police report and left with Central Precinct desk clerk.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Central Precinct desk clerk will be responsible for notifying Multnomah County Animal Control to retrieve the animal. If unable to make the notification before the end of the relief, the responsibility will be passed to the next relief until the animal is retrieved.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon release of the animal to either an owner or Animal Control, the released by and released to sections of the Impounded Animal Form will be filled out, attached to the report copy, and forwarded to Records.</p>
<p>In all instances wherein an arrestee has a domestic animal at the scene of an arrest and there is no family member/roommate present to arrange care for the animal, members will document the animal&rsquo;s disposition in their report. If it is necessary for a domestic animal to be removed from a scene and the arrestee advises of, or there are signs of, illness or injury to the animal, that information will be documented in the report and provided to the caretaker to whom the arresting member releases the animal.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531662

<p><strong>POLICY (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>Members will only present to the Multnomah County Detention Center Intake (MCDC) those suspects determined to be bookable by the Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (MCSO). Due to the nature of the MCDC population and the influence of the courts on that population, Chief&rsquo;s Memorandums will be issued periodically which will modify the bookable offender classification.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURES (870.30)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Booking: Act of presenting an arrested criminal suspect to MCDC Intake for complete processing which includes mugging, fingerprinting, medical and recognizance interviews and cell assignment. Booked suspects become part of the official MCDC population.</p>
<p>Bookable offender: Any suspect presented to MCDC on any criminal charge which does not employ the use of a citation as a charging document.</p>
<p>Bookable offense: Any criminal act listed on the current Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Special Order of charges acceptable for booking allowing for the presentation of an offender for processing within MCDC.</p>
<p>Cited offender: Any suspect presented to MCDC on any criminal charge which employs the use of a citation as a charging document, and/or for processing on any criminal charge which is not bookable per MCDC policy, yet requires identification processing per agency requirements or state statute prior to release. This situation employs the issuance of C-Cite and Z-Cite.</p>
<p>C-Citation (C-Cite): A citation in lieu of custody that may be used for all Class C felonies and felony traffic crimes.</p>
<p>Lodging for processing: Act of presenting an arrested criminal suspect to MCDC Intake only for the purpose of identification verification to allow for the proper issuance of a citation. Lodged suspects do not become part of the official MCDC population.</p>
<p>Only offenses that include the possibility of jail time may be booked or lodged at MCDC. Any violation or infraction charge that has, as a penalty, a fine or loss of privilege only, will not be accepted into MCDC.</p>
<p>Z-Citation (Z-Cite): A citation in lieu of custody that may be used for misdemeanors crimes, including misdemeanor traffic crimes and violation level or infraction level criminal offenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Open Booking Criteria (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>The following dictates what types of offenses are allowed into MCDC. The criteria may change periodically and will be reflected in updates issued by MCSO. Custody Reports will state the offense title and the appropriate ORS, Portland City Code, or other criminal law number.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Felonies: All felony suspects will be booked if possible (i.e., meeting the criteria) or lodged if not. This includes all arrests for Auto Theft (UUMV).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Misdemeanor Arrests Made in Conjunction with Probable Cause Felony Arrests: All misdemeanor arrests made in conjunction with a bookable probable cause felony arrest may be booked.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Bookable Misdemeanors: Members may book suspects arrested for Violation of a Restraining Order and mandatory arrests made under the Family Abuse Prevention Act. There are other bookable misdemeanor charges. Refer to the current Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office Special Order (MCSOSO) for the current list.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Non-Bookable Misdemeanor Arrests Made in Conjunction with Bookable Misdemeanors: Members may book all misdemeanor arrests made in conjunction with any bookable misdemeanor (i.e., one bookable charge allows all other non-bookable misdemeanor charges to be booked).</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Warrant Service: Members will book suspects arrested on all warrants, unless directed to do otherwise by the issuing authority.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Warrant Service in Conjunction with Other Arrests:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Mandatory misdemeanor arrests (i.e., arrests made under the Family Abuse Prevention Act) associated with the service of a warrant will be booked.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Probable cause Class A and B felony arrests associated with the service of a warrant may be booked.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Class C felony and misdemeanor arrests associated with the service of a warrant will not be booked (even if the charge is bookable). Instead, the suspect will be issued a citation.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;If the subject is known to the member and a citation is appropriate, the subject will not be booked or lodged at MCDC. The only exceptions to this are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;ORS mandated lodging/booking (see subsection k, this section).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If the date of the suspect&rsquo;s last picture in the Crime Capture System (CSS) is more than three years old or if the subjects image has substantially changed, such as with chronic drug users or people that have made efforts to alter their appearance.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;If the subject is not known to the member and a citation is appropriate, MCDC will check the Crime Capture System (CCS). If the subject can be identified by a CCS entry, he/she will be cited and released by the arresting member. The only exception to this is if that picture is more than three years old, the subject may be lodged.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;If the subject is not known by the member and is not in CCS, the subject will be booked or lodged into MCDC. No citation will be issued.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrests Requiring Mandatory Processing: ORS 181.511 and 181.515 require that all persons arrested on the following charges be fingerprinted and photographed at the time of arrest, even if they are to be cited in lieu of being taken into custody:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any felony.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any misdemeanor or other offense involving sexual conduct.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any crime involving the use/sale of narcotics or dangerous drugs. Possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a violation.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;Arrests for Missions: Members can work with MCSO Executive Officer to set up special booking procedures. These procedures must be negotiated well in advance of the mission.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Project 57 &ndash; a long-term mission where the City of Portland purchased extra jail beds to address chronic problems.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Large protests &ndash; in the event of large protests, MCSO may accept suspects charged with ORS crimes that are not normally accepted.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Prostitution missions.</p>
<p>Supervisors need to monitor the status of MCDC and notify his/her command if there will be any significant delays in booking due to the change in policy. This policy is set for review every 90 days and any problems need to be forwarded to the Operations Branch chief so that they can be addressed at the review meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Requirements at MCDC (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Subjects being booked:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Without accompanying citations:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;All of the charges the suspect is being booked on will be listed on the custody report.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;With accompanying citations:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;All of the charges the subject is being booked on will be listed on the custody report prior to booking.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;The charges the subject is being cited for (and not lodged on) will not be listed on the custody report until after the member leaves MCDC (MCDC does not need a copy of those citations).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Subjects being lodged:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Without accompanying violation citations:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;All of the charges the subject is being lodged on will be listed on the custody report prior to booking (members may lodge on felonies, misdemeanors only, not violations).</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;The member will give the intake deputy six copies of the custody report and six copies of each citation the subject is being lodged on.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;With accompanying violation citations:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;All of the charges the subject is being lodged on will be listed on the custody report prior to booking (members may lodge on felonies, misdemeanors only, not violations).</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;The member will give the intake deputy six copies of the custody report and six copies of each citation the subject is being lodged on.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp; The violations charges will only be listed on the custody report after the member leaves MCDC (MCDC does not need copies of the violation citations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MCDC Ramp and Sallyport Entry (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>Members transporting prisoners to MCDC will enter from the SW 2nd Ave. entrance near SW Main St. If the security screen is open, members may proceed to the security office at the bottom of the ramp. If the security screen is closed, members may contact the security personnel through an intercom and buzzer system located on the wall on the southeast corner of the entrance, or contact the Dispatch Coordinator on the radio and they will arrange to have the screen opened. Once inside, members will stop at the security office and wait to be acknowledged by the security personnel. When acknowledged, members will:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive into vehicle Sallyport #2, being sure to strike the vehicle touch-pad at the front of the enclosure. The control center will either open the security door into vehicle Sallyport #3 or contact the member via the intercom.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Enter Sallyport #3 and wait until the door is closed before taking the prisoner out of the vehicle.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Place all weapons in the assigned gun lockers or within the vehicle trunk before entering the reception area.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; Ensure that all subjects are handcuffed before entering the reception area.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Present the custody reports to MCDC. All prisoners must be either booked or cited and all charges will be designated by an ORS or City ordinance number. If a suspect is being booked on a charge or charges and is also receiving a C-Cite, there is no need to leave a photocopy of the citation with MCDC. However, the citation number must be listed on the Custody Report for MCDC computer entry.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; When booking prisoners at MCDC, members are required to leave copies of the face sheet of the Custody Report. However, on the face of the report there is only room for three (3) charges to be listed. On occasion, there are more than three (3) charges and the additional charges are written on the back of the report. It is critical that all of the charges be noted by MCDC and ID. All members should make copies of the front and back of all reports when additional charges are listed on the back of the report. These copies will be left with MCDC at the time of booking. No other action by members is required.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will present the handcuffed prisoner to the open booking area counter where a deputy will take custody of the prisoner. The MCDC deputy will search the prisoner, remove the handcuffs and return them to the officer. The member will inventory the prisoner&rsquo;s property from the opposite side of the booking counter as the deputy presents it. The member will place the property in an MCDC property bag and make notations of the inventory on the MCDC property receipts provided. The member or the MCDC deputy will record a fingerprint of the prisoner on the back of the property receipt using the inkpad provided. The fingerprints should include the full length of the fingers. The member will present the property and receipt to the property control technician at the window where a verification of the property and receipt will be made. A copy of the receipt (white) will be placed inside the property bag and sealed by the member. The sealed property bag will then be placed in a secure slot at the property window. The member will then return another copy of the receipt (pink) to the prisoner and direct him/her to the holding area. Any prisoner property that will not fit into the bag provided by MCDC will be placed into the PPB Property Room. The member may now exit the booking area.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; Place potentially dangerous, non-evidentiary, prisoner property in the MCDC property bag and place it in MCDC property room. All evidence will be processed as described in DIR 660.10 Property and Evidence Procedure.</p>
<p>Transfers from the Detective Division (Detectives) to MCDC will be conducted by, or arranged through, Detectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warrant Checks (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>Prior to transporting and presenting a suspect to MCDC, members will check for outstanding warrants using the name given by the suspect. Any warrants on file will be served.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transgender Suspects (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>MCDC has policies and procedures for lodging and booking transgender subjects. If a member is aware that a subject may be transgender, he/she will verbally inform the intake deputy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Processing for Identification Purposes in Citation Issuance Situations (870.30)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Refer to DIR 640.00.</strong></p>
<p>If the subject is not known to the member and a citation is appropriate, do not fill out the citation until after MCDC checks CCS. This will avoid excessive paperwork and void reports will not have to be filled out. If the subject is not in the system, they will be booked into jail and no citation will be needed. If they are in the system, a citation can be filled out and issued prior to the subject&rsquo;s release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Processing of Cited Individuals Who are Violent (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>Members may present cited/violent individuals to MCDC that meet the criteria listed in the MCSOSO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Processing of Injured/Ill Suspects/Prisoners (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>If a person under arrest or in custody is suspected of requiring medical treatment, the member will stand by MCDC until the intake nurse makes a determination as to the necessity of treatment. If the injuries obviously require hospital attention, or the nurse orders it, the person will be transported to the Bureau&rsquo;s contracted hospital (BCH) emergency room. Prior to transporting a subject to the BCH, the member will contact his/her precinct desk clerk or BOEC (if after 1800 hrs.) and have them relay the following to the ER:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Estimated time of arrival.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Nature of the injury.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The mental and/or physical state of the subject.</p>
<p>When reasonable and possible, requests for additional member assistance should be made prior to arrival. Such requests will be made via BOEC. The BCH has been instructed not to assist in subduing or apprehending persons attempting to escape. Once at the BCH, members will observe the following safety precautions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The Sallyport and adjacent rooms will be used.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;All persons will be searched, prior to entering the BCH.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Persons should remain handcuffed, when possible, unless treatment requires otherwise.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Members will remain with the person at all times.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Weapons may be secured in the member&rsquo;s vehicle or in a secure area provided &nbsp;by the BCH.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hospitalized Persons - Notification of MCDC (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>MCDC will only provide corrections officer coverage for persons admitted to the County&rsquo;s contracted hospital. If the arresting member elects to issue a C-Cite on a hospitalized person, it will not be necessary to notify MCDC or to have a corrections officer assigned to the person. If there is a possibility that the person will be admitted to the County&rsquo;s contracted hospital, the member will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Contact MCDC and inform a supervisor of the possible need for a corrections deputy.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If the County&rsquo;s contract hospital determines that the injured person is to be admitted, the member will again contact MCDC informing them of that decision.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;MCDC will then make arrangements for a corrections deputy to relieve the member as soon as possible.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;If an MCSO deputy has not arrived within the hour of the verifying call, the member will inform his/her supervisor who will contact MCDC.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Members will not leave these persons until properly relieved by a corrections deputy.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once relieved by a corrections deputy, the member will promptly deliver a copy of the Custody Report (or ensure the delivery of a copy of the report) to the MCDC intake sergeant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suspects/Prisoners at Other Treatment Facilities (870.30)</strong></p>
<p>Members may have to deal with injured suspects at treatment facilities other than the BCH or the County&rsquo;s contract hospital. These situations may involve trauma cases and self-admittals. Because MCDC will not assign a corrections deputy to any hospital other than their contract hospital, members involved in these situations may take any one of the following methods:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Pursue a probable cause arrest following the release of the individual.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Pursue the grand jury/warrant avenue.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Issue a C-Cite.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the suspect/patient has stabilized, request that the medical facility staff determine if transfer to either the MCDC medical ward or the County&rsquo;s contract hospital would be appropriate. If a transfer is appropriate, an arrest may be made and the procedures for notifying MCDC instituted.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531661

<p><strong>POLICY (870.25)</strong></p>
<p>Prisoners in a precinct/division will be restricted to holding rooms, and the area adjacent to the rooms, with the highest priority placed on the security and safety of Bureau members and other persons. The holding rooms will be disinfected weekly, or more often as needed, to ensure a safe environment for members and prisoners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (870.25)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Contamination: When a holding room, immediate area or vehicle comes in contact with body fluids or suspected Staph/Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infection.</p>
<p>Holding cell: A room used to temporarily hold a subject while a member completes a preliminary investigation prior to booking and/or citing, and/or verifies the subject&rsquo;s identification. Juvenile status offenders will not be placed in holding cells.</p>
<p>Immediate area: Part of a precinct/division that contains the holding rooms. The immediate area may be physically divided by a door or implied by the design of the building.</p>
<p>Prisoner: Any subject taken into custody by a member, whether it is voluntary or not.</p>
<p>Responsible member: A sworn member that is responsible for a prisoner.</p>
<p>Securing a vehicle or holding cell: Sealing it from use with a bio-hazard warning until it can be disinfected.</p>
<p>Sign in/sign out log (Adult and Juvenile): A log that is maintained in the immediate area for documenting when prisoners are placed in and removed from holding rooms. There will be an entry in the log for each prisoner placed in a holding cell, no matter how long they were there. Each log entry will contain the following information: the name of the member responsible for the prisoner, the name of the prisoner, the date and time the prisoner was placed into and removed from the holding room and an indication the holding room was searched after the removal of the prisoner. In addition to the above, the juvenile log will include age or DOB of the offender, the offense, and the disposition of the juvenile.</p>
<p>Staph/MRSA skin infection: A communicable disease that can be spread by contact between infected skin and healthy skin, and infected objects and healthy skin. Staph/MSRA may be present in a pimple, rash, boil, blister or open wound, and can often look like a spider or insect bite. If left untreated, Staph/MRSA may progress from a skin irritation to a serious bone or blood infection. Staph/MRSA can live for up to 24 hours on infected objects and skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Juvenile Requirements (870.25)</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of detaining juveniles in holding rooms is to secure only those that have engaged in criminal behavior. &nbsp;It is preferable to detain compliant, minor offenders in non-secure areas. &nbsp;Juveniles who commit crimes may be held in a secure manner for up to five hours. &nbsp;It is not permitted to hold status offenders, non-offenders, violators, alien juveniles, or civil-type juvenile offenders in a secure manner at any time (see Directive 850.30 Juveniles, Custody for more detail). These juveniles may be detained in a non secure area of the facility for processing while awaiting transportation.</p>
<p>Juveniles will not have contact with adult prisoners. Contact is defined to include any physical or sustained sight or sound contact. Brief and/or inadvertent contacts between juvenile offenders in a secure custody status and adult prisoners in holding cells do not count as violations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Members Responsibilities (870.25)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Arresting member:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Ensure that all prisoners transported to a precinct/division are restricted to the precinct&rsquo;s/division&rsquo;s holding rooms and/or the immediate area. Prisoners will not be allowed in the report writing area of the precinct, even if it is part of the immediate area.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Prisoners will remain handcuffed at all times while in a holding room or the immediate area. The investigation and interview process is often best served by unhandcuffing prisoners while they are detained in holding cells and during interviews. Approval to unhandcuff prisoners must be obtained from a sergeant or detective or by exceptions authorized by specific division SOP. Safety considerations require that movement between cells and interview rooms is generally done with prisoners handcuffed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Inspect the holding room for hazards and contraband prior to placing the prisoner in it. If either is found, document their existence and take the appropriate action.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Search and remove all non-essential property from the prisoner prior to placing the prisoner in the holding room. This includes, but is not limited to, objects that can be used as a weapon or means of escape, and non-essential clothing such as belts, shoes and jewelry. All removed property will accompany prisoners to booking, or be returned upon release.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Write the day&rsquo;s date, the time, the prisoner&rsquo;s name, and the arresting member&rsquo;s name on the board outside the holding room.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Complete the prisoner entry in the sign in/out log.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Ensure the prisoner is monitored at all times. This requires the following:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; A sworn member must be either in the immediate area or report writing room at all times.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; The responsible member will not leave the immediate area until another sworn member is present and responsibility has been delegated for the observation and custody of the prisoner.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp; Members will continuously check the welfare of the prisoner every 15 minutes or more frequently if needed.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Report any contamination to a precinct shift supervisor.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;If the prisoner is a juvenile:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Ensure all information is written into the Juvenile Secure Custody Log.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Juveniles &nbsp;must &nbsp;be &nbsp;placed &nbsp;into &nbsp;separate &nbsp;holding &nbsp;rooms &nbsp;from adults.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Juveniles may not be held in a police precinct for more than five hours.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Supervisor responsibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Ensure the sign-in/sign-out logs are maintained.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure the SOP for contaminated holding rooms and vehicles is adhered to.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Ensure the special procedures for juveniles are followed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;RU manager responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop an SOP for cleaning holding rooms, the immediate area and vehicles that have been contaminated, or are suspected to be contaminated, with body fluids or Staph/MRSA.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Ensure the SOP is posted in the immediate area.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Bureau members:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Perform any required duties per the decontamination SOP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Contaminated Holding Rooms and Vehicles (870.25)</strong></p>
<p>To help prevent the spread of Staph/MRSA skin infection and other communicable diseases the following steps shall be taken in the event of contamination.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who determine a holding room, immediate area and/or vehicle are contaminated will:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Treat the contamination as a bio-hazard, and take appropriate safety precautions.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Secure the contaminated area and/or vehicle.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Follow the RU&rsquo;s SOP for contamination.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Notify a precinct/division shift supervisor of the contamination, and securing of the contaminated areas.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Document any member&rsquo;s exposure to the contamination in the injury log.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Members will not use a vehicle or holding cell that has been secured.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531657

<p><strong>PROCEDURE (870.20)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Maximum restraint or maximum restraint position: Placing an in-custody person with hands secured behind the back, legs secured together, and the legs and hands connected together behind the back of the subject with the subject&rsquo;s legs flexed at the knees. The length of the restraint cord used to secure the hands to the feet will be such that the lower legs are no closer than a 90-degree angle in relation to the person&rsquo;s trunk.</p>
<p>Restraint cords: Flexcuffs, or other devices (i.e., cords, chains or straps) used to temporarily restrict a prisoner&rsquo;s movement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Handcuffing (870.20)</strong></p>
<p>In an attempt to minimize the risk of personal injury to members and citizens during arrest situations, all members will handcuff, as soon as possible, all persons arrested:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Under the authority of a warrant or a court order.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;On probable cause pursuant to ORS 133.310 and 133.225.</p>
<p>In addition, members have authority to handcuff persons under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Investigatory stops (ORS 131.605-625). Members have authority to handcuff a person when the member has a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts that the person has committed a crime, and:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person will flee if not restrained.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person might present an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the member or others present if not restrained (per Oregon and Federal law).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is, or the member reasonably suspects based on articulable facts that the person will be physically uncooperative with the member in a way that interferes with the member&rsquo;s ability to pursue the investigation or conduct the stop safely if the person is not restrained.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The authority to handcuff during investigatory stops continues only as long as one of the circumstances listed above exists, or as long as continued restraint serves to avoid one of the circumstances. If a change in situation eliminates all justification for the handcuffing, and no member believes that any of the circumstances listed above will exist if the person is released from the handcuffs, the handcuffs must be removed.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detentions for investigation of infractions and violations: Members have authority to handcuff a person when the member has authority to detain the person under ORS 133.072 (Non-traffic Violation in Presence of Officer) or ORS 810.410(2) (Traffic Infraction Investigation and Citation), and:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person will flee if not restrained.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person might present an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the member or other present if not restrained (per Oregon and Federal case law).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is, or the member reasonably suspects based on articulable facts that the person will be, physically uncooperative with the member in a way that interferes with the member&rsquo;s ability to pursue the investigation or conduct the detention safely if the person is not restrained.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The authority to handcuff during investigatory stops continues only as long as one of the circumstances listed above exists, or as long as continued restraint serves to avoid one of the circumstances. If a change in situation eliminates all justification for the handcuffing, and no member believes that any of the circumstances listed above will exist if the person is released from the handcuffs, the handcuffs must be removed.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; Other authority to handcuff: Members have authority to handcuff a person when they have authority to detain under the following relevant statutes:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Detox holds (ORS 430.399).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Peace officer custodies (ORS 426.228).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Detentions for conducting mandatory fingerprinting and photographing of sex offenders and Uniform Controlled Substances Act violators (ORS 181.515).</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Detentions to determine identity of a person for the purpose of issuing a citation for a violation or infraction (ORS 153.039).</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person will flee if not restrained.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;A reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that the person might present an immediate threat of serious physical injury to the member or others present if not restrained (per Oregon and Federal case law).</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person is, or the member reasonably suspects based on articulable facts that the person will be, physically uncooperative with the member in a way that interferes with the member&rsquo;s ability to pursue the investigation or conduct the detention safely if the person is not restrained.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;The authority to handcuff during the above situations continues only as long as one of the circumstances listed above exists, or as long as continued restraint serves to avoid one of the circumstances. If a change in situation eliminates all justification for the handcuffing, and no member believes that any of the circumstances listed above will exist if the person is released from the handcuffs, the handcuffs must be removed.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution of search warrant at private residence: Members have authority, under ORS 133.605(1), to handcuff people they encounter on the premises as is reasonably necessary for the execution of the search warrant with all practicable safety.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Execution of search warrants at business premises open to the public (restaurants, bars, public area of offices, etc.): Under the common law of Oregon, members engaged in a lawful police activity can justify the handcuffing of a person who is not a suspect if it reasonably appears under the circumstances that handcuffing is necessary to protect a member or others from physical harm. Resistance to handcuffing under these circumstances does not support a charge of Resisting Arrest because the person is handcuffed not as part of an arrest, but only as a means of self-defense or defense of others. Because these kinds of detentions are not based on criminal conduct and the justification for the handcuffing can dissipate rapidly, members must pay close attention to the circumstances which justify these handcuffings, and if a change in circumstances eliminates all justification for the handcuffing, the handcuffs must be removed.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; Regardless of the situation, the handcuffing of an individual and its justification will be documented in the member&rsquo;s notebook and in an appropriate police report, per DIR 1010.20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Handcuffs (870.20)</strong></p>
<p>Only Bureau approved handcuffs will be used and require the following characteristics:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;A ratchet locking system.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Of solid metal construction.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;With a double locking mechanism.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Operated by a standard skeleton key.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;With an interlocking metal chain consisting of two links.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Connected to the handcuffs by an eye bolt that rotates freely on the metal cuff, engraved with a manufacturer&rsquo;s serial number, and labeled with the officer&rsquo;s DPSST number.</p>
<p>Handcuffs will be applied with the person&rsquo;s hands placed behind their back. When possible, handcuffs will be applied so as to not inhibit blood circulation. Handcuffs will be double locked prior to transport to prevent accidental tightening and to reduce the possibility of escape. If the handcuffs are cutting off circulation, the member will loosen them at the earliest safe opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>All individuals must be handcuffed prior to entering a custodial, detoxification or hospital facility.</p>
<p>Alternate means of securing a subject may be used if the person in custody has, or reasonably appears to have, an injury or condition that would be further aggravated by handcuffing.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexcuffs: Flexcuffs may be used in lieu of regular handcuffs when handcuffs are not available or when it is practical for the situation. Flexcuffs may also be used as leg restraints when necessary to restrain violent or unruly persons. Flexcuffs should be removed with wire cutters, unless emergency conditions exist which make it impractical to obtain wire cutters.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Restraint Cords: Members are authorized to use hobble restraint cords when necessary to subdue or secure a violent or unruly person. Restraint cords should not be used in lieu of handcuffs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transports (870.20) </strong></p>
<p><strong>Member Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Transporting Prisoners Under Maximum Restraint.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Members are responsible for monitoring the condition of persons taken into their custody. In order to avoid possible asphyxia or death due to restricting or blocking the normal function of the lung or airway, persons who have been handcuffed will not be allowed to remain in a face down position; except when necessary for the safety of members. In particular, members should closely monitor subjects placed in maximum restraint positions who are markedly obese and/or under the influence of substances.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;After restraint devices have been applied, the person should immediately be placed in a position to allow free movement of the chest and stomach for breathing functions. The best options are upright seated position or lying on a side with legs no closer than a 90-degree angle. The intent is to not allow body weight or the restraints to restrict the lungs&rsquo; ability to fill and expel air.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Special attention will be given to persons who must be restrained in custody and exhibit bizarre, violent and paranoid or deranged behavior. A subject in this condition who suddenly becomes quiet and/or appears to be unconscious may be subject to drug-related death. As conditions dictate, members will exercise good judgment in administering aid and calling for emergency medical services to respond.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoners who are placed in a maximum restraint position will be transported to the appropriate facility in a two-member car. The passenger member will constantly monitor the prisoner&rsquo;s condition. Members will inform the facility the prisoner is transported to that the maximum restraint position was used on him/her during transport.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will notify a supervisor in all cases where a prisoner is under maximum restraint prior to transport.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Routine transportation of prisoners or others: All persons should be secured in a seatbelt in an upright position and must be secured with less than one inch of movement at the belt path. Child safety seats must be used for all children under four years of age and 40 pounds or less.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Rear-facing child safety seats, placed in the back seat of a Bureau vehicle with standard back seats, must be used for children under one year of age. A rear-facing child safety seat must not be put in the front seat of a vehicle with a passenger side air bag, whether the air bag can be deactivated with a switch or not.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Children between one year and four years must be in an upright, forward-facing child safety seat, and may be secured in the front seat of a vehicle with passenger side bag.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Child safety seats will not be used in the back seats of caged patrol cars with the hard plastic seats and no lap belts. Children must not exceed the height and weight limits of the child safety seat.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Safety belts will be used for children over six years of age and over 60 pounds. Children between four and six years of age, between 40 and 60 pounds, must be in a booster seat using the vehicle&rsquo;s safety belts to secure it.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;To provide for the safe and humane treatment of persons in custody, transporting members will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Drive in a manner so as to provide as little discomfort as possible to passengers.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Not leave the vehicle unattended while persons in custody are being held inside.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not engage in personal activities (lunch, coffee, etc.), engage in pursuits or cover other calls while persons in custody are in the hicle.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Ensure only one violent prisoner at a time is transported in a police vehicle.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Circumstances will arise which dictate alternate courses of action. However, under normal circumstances members will:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Transport no more than 10 persons in the patrol wagon or two persons in a police car.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver person(s) in custody to the appropriate holding facility, detective section, youth service center or home without delay and by the most direct route.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Members will notify the dispatcher and note the times of arrest (10-61), departure from the arrest scene (10-62), arrival at the detention facility (10-64) and return to service (10-8).</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;The person in custody will be checked for outstanding warrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Supervisor Responsibilities (870.20)</strong></p>
<p>When notified that a subject is under maximum restraint, a supervisor will determine the best method of restraining and transporting the subject. The supervisor will respond to the scene if he/she can do so in a timely manner. If a timely response is not practical, the supervisor may direct the appropriate restraint and transport via telephone or radio.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531653

<li>Circuit Court Void Request Forms (Traffic)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (860.40)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Void Request of Uniform Traffic Citation by the Member</strong></p>
<p>Three general conditions may exist when a member wishes to request that a citation be voided by the court.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who discover that a mistake was made while filling out a citation, before the summons copy is given to the defendant, may issue a new one and request that the incorrect citation be voided. A new citation is preferable to erasures, crossing out or altering (a changed condition is subject to legitimate objections by defense counsel).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The citation to be voided will not have the word VOID written across the face. Voiding a citation is a prerogative of the court. The Uniform Traffic Citation Void Request Form will be completed explaining the error and include the number of the citation issued in lieu of the original citation. Members will staple all copies of the original citation to the void form, obtain the approval of the RU manager and forward the materials to the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If while writing a citation (or after its completion) the member decides that the summons should not be issued, the procedure to request cancellation is the same as described in section a above.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp; The third condition would be after a citation has been issued and the summons copy cannot be recovered. In this case, the Uniform Traffic Citation Void Request Form should not be used. A memo explaining the circumstances should be directed through channels to the RU manager for approval. A memo is preferable to the form because it will be noticed and receive immediate attention from the court. Mistakes on the citation, such as incorrect charge or location of offense, etc., can only be amended in open court by a motion of the member or DA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Void Request of Parking Citations (860.40)</strong></p>
<p>If a member has cause to seek cancellation of a parking citation, the member should fill out the Parking Tag Void Request Card.</p>
<p>Members who discover that a written mistake has been made while filling out a parking citation before the violator copy is issued, may issue a new parking citation. To void the original parking citation, the member will prepare a Circuit Court Void Form, explain the error and include the number of the new parking citation. The word void must not be written on the parking citation. Both copies of the parking citation must be attached to the void form and forwarded to the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>Members who start to fill out a parking citation for issuance, but decide not to issue a parking citation, shall fill out a Circuit Court Void Form, explaining why the parking citation was not issued, following the same procedure as set out above.</p>
<p>Members discovering a written mistake after the violator copy has been issued will forward the parking citation to the Circuit Court in the usual manner. The issuing member will note on the Circuit Court Void Form that the defendant has a copy of the citation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Void Request of Parking Citations (Police Vehicles) (860.40)</strong></p>
<p>A request that the court dismiss a parking tag issued to a police vehicle by another party must be made by letter rather than the Void Request Form.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;It is the policy of the Bureau that members will be subject to parking regulations the same as any citizen. However, the emergency nature of law enforcement will occasionally require that Bureau vehicles will be parked in violation. If a parking citation results, it may be turned in with a letter addressed to the Court Administrator requesting dismissal.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Requests for dismissal of these parking citations must be on letterhead stationery, have an adequate explanation of the official business being conducted, and be approved by the individual&rsquo;s RU manager.</p>
<p>Cancellation of parking citations for members&rsquo; private vehicles will not be considered except for those reasons established by the court as applicable to the general public. The Bureau will not approve a letter requesting dismissal of parking tags issued to a member&rsquo;s private vehicle because he or she had to work overtime.</p>
<p>An exception where the Bureau might consider approving a request to void a parking tag on an employee&rsquo;s vehicle would be when documentation can be provided that the car had prior approval to be used on city business.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531647

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>To enhance communication and understanding between the community and the Bureau, members will ensure that victims and complainants understand the complaint signing process. Members will also ensure that victims and complainants understand the associated responsibilities when booking and lodging an arrested person into custody or issuing that person a citation by completing a Police Bureau &ldquo;Victim/Complainant Information Form&rdquo; in all cases where a private (rather than public) victim exists.</p>
<p>Bureau members will follow current MCDC Special Orders and current Bureau policy when deciding whether to book and lodge an arrested person in jail or issue them a citation. Citations will be issued for all offenses that are classified as violations or infractions under the ORS or Portland City Code. Violation or infraction level offenses do not carry jail time as a possible sentence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (860.30)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Booking: The act of presenting an arrested criminal suspect to MCDC Intake for presentation to a magistrate for charging and complete processing which includes fingerprinting, photographing, medical and recognizance interviews, and cell assignment. Booked suspects become part of the official detention center population.</p>
<p>Bookable offender: Any arrested person presented to MCDC Intake on any criminal charge, which may or may not employ the use of a citation.</p>
<p>Bookable offense: Any ORS Statute or City Code Ordinance listed in the current MCDC Special Order. Persons arrested for one or more of these listed ORS Statutes and City Code Ordinances are allowed to be booked into MCDC Intake for either complete processing without a citation or for mug and print processing with a citation.</p>
<p>Booking for mug and print: Any arrested person who has been issued a citation that is lodged into MCDC Intake for identification processing (mug and print) per the Bureau&rsquo;s requirement or as required by state statute prior to release. This situation employs the issuance of C-Cite and Z-Cite.</p>
<p>Lodging: Act of presenting an arrested person to MCDC Intake only for the purpose of identification verification to allow for the proper issuance of a citation. Lodged suspects do not become part of the official detention center population.</p>
<p>C-Citation (C-Cite): A citation in lieu of custody that shall be used whenever an arrested person is cited for at least one felony crime (including felony traffic crimes) with or without additional misdemeanors crimes which can be either from the ORS or the City Code.</p>
<p>Z-Citation (Z-Cite): A citation in lieu of custody that shall be used whenever an arrested person is cited for at least one misdemeanor crime (including misdemeanor traffic crimes) and shall be used for all violation or infraction level offenses (traffic and non-traffic violations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Authority to Issue Citations (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 133.055 allows for a citation to be issued when a person is arrested for a Class C felony, PCS I, or Delivery of Marijuana for Consideration. Also, it allows for a citation to be issued when a person is arrested for any misdemeanor or violation level offense except when an assault, harassment, menacing, domestic non-criminal menacing or violation of a restraining order has occurred in a domestic relationship incident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Community Safety Exceptions (CSE) (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>A community safety exemption allows a member to book and lodge an arrested person who is charged with a felony or misdemeanor crime that is not a bookable offense under the current MCDC Special Order, if the following criteria are met:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The offender is bookable.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal offense involved violence, or a potential for violence exists if the defendant is released.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; In the member&rsquo;s opinion, there exists the possibility of a recurrence of the same or more serious crime.</p>
<p>Using a CSE:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Member responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The arresting member must get approval for a CSE from his/her sergeant prior to transporting the subject to MCDC.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once approval has been granted, the arresting member will book the subject at MCDC (see DIR 870.30).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Sergeant responsibilities:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sergeant receiving the request for a CSE will contact the MCDC Intake sergeant for approval.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon approval, the sergeant will instruct the arresting member to book the subject at MCDC (see DIR 870.30).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;If approval is not granted, the sergeant will inform the arresting member that the CSE request has been denied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One Member Issuance: Arrest and Reporting (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>Routinely, only one member will effect an arrest and advise the arrested person of his/her Miranda rights and issue the citation. Whenever more than one member is present at an incident, the other members associated with the incident will have their involvement/association to the case detailed in the arresting member&rsquo;s report unless that member was involved in the arrest in some manner or the incident involves a situation where a member was injured or was attempted to be injured. Refer to the narrative section of the Custody, Investigation and Continuation Reports (i.e., cover, transport, finder of evidence, etc.). Additional members observing elements, factors or gathering information pertinent to the case, which is separate and distinct from that of the arresting member, will complete a Special Report detailing their involvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Arrest Situations (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>The supervisor-in-charge of a mission, demonstration, or other such event that has the potential for creating mass misdemeanor arrests, is to notify the MCDC Officer-in-Charge (MCDC-OIC), the Bureau&rsquo;s Complaint Signer&rsquo;s Office and the appropriate DA Unit prior to the event. Misdemeanor arraignments will occur not more than 30 days from the date of arrest, but as close to 30 days as possible. Arraignment dates should be distributed over several days beginning with latest available court date and working back (30 days if possible). Whenever possible, do not cite more than 8-10 subjects for any single date. &nbsp;Monday and Friday arraignments are to be avoided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrests Requiring Mandatory Processing for Mug and Print (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 181.511 and 181.515 require that all persons arrested on the following charges be fingerprinted and photographed at the time of arrest, even if they are to be cited in lieu of being taken into custody:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Any felony.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Any misdemeanor or other offense involving sexual conduct.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Any crime involving the possession or delivery of a controlled substance. Possession of less than one ounce of marijuana is a violation and, therefore, is not subject to being booked into MCDC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Identity Questions (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>In those situations where the reasonable identity of an arrested suspect is either unknown or in question, the arresting member will follow the procedures outlined in DIRs 640.00 and 870.30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MCDC Processing of Persons Subject to Citation (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>When all other means of identification verification have been exhausted (as discussed in DIR 640.00), arrested persons who are eligible for booking or lodging will be processed into MCDC under the name presented by the offender or Jane/John Doe. The narrative portion of the Custody Report will contain language articulating all efforts made to determine the identity of the arrested person prior to taking them to MCDC Intake for the processing.</p>
<p>If the MCDC or Police Bureau ID staff are able to determine the true name of the arrested person being processed at MCDC Intake, and the arresting member is still present, he/she will add the Furnishing False Information charge onto his/her custody or onto a citation (along with the original felony or misdemeanor crime that the person was arrested for) and issue that citation to the arrested person. If the arresting member is not still present, the matter will be handled by MCDC and the DA&rsquo;s Office, as discussed in DIR 640.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Processing of Jailable Violent Suspects Who Have Been, or Are to Be, Issued a Citation (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>Members may present cited (C-Cite and Z-Cite) violent suspects to MCDC Intake for processing, provided the suspect is eligible for booking or lodging. This includes persons subject to the Alcoholic Treatment Act (DIR 850.10) who are charged with criminal offenses during the custody situation or following placement in Detox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Physical Evidence (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>Seized evidence will be processed in the same manner as in other arrests as outlined in DIR 660.10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warrant Checks (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>Prior to releasing a cited suspect or transporting an arrested suspect to MCDC, members will check for outstanding warrants using the name given by the suspect. Any warrants on file will be served. MCDC Intake will serve outstanding warrants on those suspects found to have provided false information following the arresting member&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Citable &nbsp;Offense &nbsp;Arrests &nbsp;Made &nbsp;in &nbsp;Conjunction &nbsp;with &nbsp;Other &nbsp;Situations </strong><strong>(860.30)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Warrant Service in Conjunction with Other Arrests:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory misdemeanor arrests (i.e., arrests made under the Family Abuse Prevention Act) associated with the service of a warrant shall be booked and not cited. All additional felony and misdemeanor charges shall be added to the custody report for booking and will not be cited.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;All felony arrests associated with the service of a warrant shall be booked and not cited.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;All misdemeanor arrests associated with the service of a warrant will not be booked (even if the charge is bookable). Instead, the suspect will be issued a citation for the new misdemeanor crime(s) as follows:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;The warrant charge(s) the suspect is being booked on will be listed on the custody report prior to booking.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;The charges the suspect is being cited for (and not lodged on) will not be &nbsp;&nbsp;listed on the custody report until after the member leaves MCDC (MCDC does not need a copy of those citations).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Misdemeanor arrests made in conjunction with a felony arrest, under which the suspect will be booked and lodged in MCDC, will also be added to the custody report for booking along with the felony charge(s) rather than cited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outside Cite-In-Lieu Warrant Arrest (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>Multnomah County Cite-in-Lieu warrants and all other warrants will be processed as follows. When a member arrests a suspect on an outside Cite-in-Lieu warrant, the following procedures will be followed:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will have BOEC Service Net confirm the warrant and obtain all necessary information to complete the C-Cite (i.e., court date and location).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will call Teletype stating that he/she has an outside Cite-in-Lieu warrant. The member will give Teletype the information they request to clear the warrant with the outside agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Private Person (Citizen) Issuance (ORS 133.235) (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>When an arrest has been made by a non-Bureau member or on behalf of a non-Bureau member (including private security agents):</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The complainant/victim will be informed that he/she must contact the DA&rsquo;s office and request that the incident be reviewed for possible prosecution.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The involved member will ensure that the complainant/victim is familiar with how to contact the appropriate DA Unit. To facilitate this procedure, the member shall issue and explain to the non-Bureau member a completed Police Bureau Victim/Complainant Information Form. If the suspect was lodged at MCDC, the victim will be instructed on the form to contact the D.A.&rsquo;s office by 1100 hours the next business day. If the suspect was issued a citation, the victim will be instructed on the form to contact the D.A.&rsquo;s office no sooner than two business days after the arrest.</p>
<p>When private security agents make arrests at business establishments, members will not advise those suspects of their constitutional rights, unless it is deemed necessary to conduct an independent investigation. In such cases, the member&rsquo;s reports will detail his/her involvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Voiding Citations (860.30)</strong></p>
<p>All citations (C-Cites and Z-Cites), which have not been issued but must be voided, will be forwarded to the member&rsquo;s RU manager for destruction. In cases where an issued citation needs to voided, but it is not retrievable, members will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Complete a Circuit Court Officer&rsquo;s Request to Void Non-Issued Uniform Traffic Complaint (Z-Cite) (DC500, 8-1-79) and staple it to the citation.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The District Attorney&rsquo;s office is notified through an entry into the DA&rsquo;s database.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members desiring to continue the complaint issuing process will recite the suspect, or if unable &nbsp;to do so, may pursue a warrant through the Complaint Signer&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/531643

<p><strong>POLICY (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>Inadvertent vehicle operator behavior oftentimes results in the commission of motor vehicle law violations. The Bureau recognizes this fact and strives to promote voluntary motor vehicle compliance on the part of traffic violators.</p>
<p>Members are encouraged to use discretion in deciding whether a verbal or written warning, citation issuance or physical arrest should be used in a particular situation.</p>
<p>The procedures contained within this directive will assist members who determine that the issuance of a citation and/or the arrest of a subject is the appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 810.410 (Arrest and Citation) provides authority for police officers to issue citations and/or make arrests in traffic offense situations. When official action is deemed necessary, the Z-Citation (Z-Cite) will be used for:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Motor vehicle code violations, misdemeanors and certain suspended operator license offenses.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Bicycle offenses.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Pedestrian offenses.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Auto dealer licensing and sale offenses.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Auto wrecker licensing and sale offenses.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Offensive littering offenses.</p>
<p>Offenders arrested for traffic related felonies will be issued a C-Citation (C-Cite) or booked or lodged into the Multnomah County Detention Center (MCDC). Only one DUII offense will be listed on a Z-Cite. Up to three charges may be listed on a Z-Cite if appropriate. The member will check the appropriate boxes indicating the existing weather and traffic conditions. If the violation involves an accident, the member will check the appropriate boxes. If an accident report is written, the entire section will be circled. Do not mix infractions and crimes on the same citation.</p>
<p>Members will complete the signature, I.D. number, division/unit number, days off and district number (i.e., 890) where the &ldquo;offense occurred&rdquo; sections of the citation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One-Member Issuance/Arrest and Reporting (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>Routinely, only one member will affect an arrest, advise arrestees of their Miranda rights and lodge the arrestee and/or issue Z-Cite and/or C-Cite.</p>
<p>Whenever more than one member is present at an incident, all reports will reflect the facts from the point of view of the arresting/citing member. All other members associated with an incident will be identified and their involvement detailed in the arresting member&rsquo;s report. Refer to the Narrative portion of the Custody, Investigation and Continuation Reports, (i.e., cover officer-security, transporting member, finder of evidence).</p>
<p>When additional members observe elements, factors, or gather information pertinent to a case that is separate and distinct from that of the arresting member, they will complete a Special Report detailing their involvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Violations &ndash; General (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 810.410(2) provides authority for officers to issue citations for violations committed in their presence. The following procedures will be followed when issuing a Z-Cite for a traffic violation:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The affidavit on the back of the Officers Notes (green) copy of the Z-Cite will be completed and signed by the issuing member.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The handwriting on the citation must be legible. Illegible citations may be dismissed.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Sergeants are responsible for ensuring that all citations and affidavits are filled out correctly, and are legible.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any deficiencies will be referred to the issuing member&rsquo;s supervisor for correction.</p>
<p>When a violator is issued multiple Z-Cites, all citations will indicate the same appearance date and time.</p>
<p>One member will issue all Z-Cites to violators who commit multiple traffic offenses. The only exception to this procedure will be when an infraction is committed out of the primary member&rsquo;s presence and issuance is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Members will write Custody Report across the top of the face of the Z-Cite when a Custody Report is written for any traffic offense.</p>
<p>All traffic offense citations, including those issued in conjunction with traffic crimes, will be forwarded to Records for further distribution. Records will forward the report and citations to the appropriate RU.</p>
<p>Following normal processing, persons cited for traffic infractions will be released. Refer to ORS 153.110(3) and ORS 810.410.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Crimes (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Refer to ORS 810.410(1).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic Misdemeanors General: Members may issue a Z-Cite or arrest and take into custody traffic misdemeanor offenders if the member observes the crime, or has probable cause to believe the person to be arrested committed the crime. A report will be prepared detailing the circumstances of all major traffic offenses, traffic crime situations. The report, DMV printout, a PPDS printout, printout of officer&rsquo;s court unavailability record, and the Z-Cite will be placed in a completed Traffic Case Envelope and submitted to Records. The green (Officer&rsquo;s Notes) copy of the Z-Cite will have Custody Report written on its reverse side and will remain with the Z-Cite. A copy of the officer&rsquo;s notes will be placed in the case envelope.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Traffic Felonies General: A person arrested for a traffic felony will be booked into MCDC, or issued a C-citation.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Felony Case Requirements (Suspect booked or cited):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtain a case number from Records&rsquo; Numbering Desk. Write the case number on all pages of the reports. (Records may require a sergeant&rsquo;s approval.).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Write Felony in front of the charge on both the case envelopes and on the Custody Report under charges (i.e., Felony DUII, Felony Hit and Run).</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Send original reports, in a case envelope, to Records, via standard procedure. Include a photocopy (not the original) of the citations. This case envelope does not need to be completely filled out as it is only used to hold the paperwork.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Include two (2) copies of all related reports in a second case envelope.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; Make copies of both sides of all reports and forms to include DMV Implied Consent Forms.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Include one (1) copy of all PPDS, CCH, DO7, and a full DMV driving history printouts (all pages).</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Include original citations, after copying them for Records.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Place a note on the Morning Relief UDAR requesting that a morning relief officer hand deliver the case envelope to the Complaint Signer&rsquo;s Office for delivery to the District Attorney. All cases with Custody Reports will be turned in prior to going off shift.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Driving While Suspended/Revoked &ndash; Violation, Misdemeanor and Felony</strong></p>
<p><strong>(860.10)</strong></p>
<p>The disposition of persons cited or arrested for driving with a suspended or revoked operator&rsquo;s license varies, depending upon the classification of the suspension or revocation and the circumstances associated to the arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Citations Issued in Conjunction With Criminal Charges (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>All original Z-Cite and traffic-related C-Cites issued in conjunction with any non-traffic criminal charge will be attached to the reports and forwarded to Records. Records will forward original citations and copies of the reports to the appropriate RU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Giving False Information/Misuse of Identification Card (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>It is a Class A Misdemeanor to knowingly use or give a false or fictitious name, address or date of birth to a police officer for a violation of the motor vehicle code (ORS 807.620).</p>
<p>Arrests may be made when a driver has failed to carry or present a license when being lawfully stopped for violating the motor vehicle code. In such cases, the arrest will be made for the purposes of identifying the person so as to allow for correct citation issuance (ORS 807.570). Members will refer to DIR 640.00 for details related to processing and citation issuance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Citations/Arrests within the City but Outside Multnomah County </strong><strong>(860.10) Refer to DIR 820.00.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Citation Issuance by Private Persons (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 153.058 allows private persons the right to commence citation issuance proceedings in traffic matters. When a private person is adamant about issuing a Z-Cite to another person and has the information necessary to identify both the offender and his/her vehicle, members will:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete a Special Report stating the allegation, the offending vehicle, the names and vital identifying information of all involved parties, as well as their statement. In some cases, members may conduct brief investigations to determine the name of the alleged violator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Complete a Z-Cite, leaving the court time appearance, date and signature spaces blank.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Direct the complaining person to appear at the Circuit Court Clerk&rsquo;s Office Traffic Department, Multnomah County Courthouse, 7 to 14 days after the date of investigation in order to swear to, and sign the Z-Cite.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Send all copies of the Z-Cite, along with a copy of the Special Report of the incident, to the Circuit Court Clerk&rsquo;s Office Traffic Department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Traffic Collisions (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 810.410(4) provides authority for police officers to issue Z-Cite and/or make traffic crime arrests at the scenes of traffic collisions under the following conditions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The officer witnesses an offense.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer has probable cause to believe a person involved in the accident has committed a traffic offense (refer to DIR 640.50).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DUII &ndash; Non-Injured Suspect (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>Members contacting intoxicated operators may call upon Traffic units for assistance. Members of the Traffic Division may assist by processing and citing the operator. Members initiating the stop will complete a Special Report detailing his/ her observations.</p>
<p>If Traffic units are not available, members will exercise discretion in determining the appropriate action. If the member determines that an arrest is appropriate, he/she will conduct the proper field sobriety tests to establish probable cause, administer the breath examination, and issue the appropriate citations and documents to the arrestee. Members who are not certified to administer the breath test will call upon a certified operator for assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DUII &ndash; Injured Suspect (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>ORS 813.140 allows for the seizing of body fluids (blood and urine) for the purposes of determining the presence of intoxicants in DUII cases. When operators suspected of being under the influence are injured and transported to medical facilities, members may make contact at the hospital. When the individual&rsquo;s medical condition prohibits release within a reasonable time to allow for a breath examination, the member may attempt to obtain a blood or urine sample. (See Obtaining Evidence).</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Conscious Individuals: When injured subjects are conscious, consent must be obtained prior to the obtaining of body fluids for the purposes of evidentiary use in DUII cases. Depending upon the circumstances, the request may be made before an arrest (if probable cause is lacking and the results of the test would be used later to support the arrest and citation issuance) or following an arrest (if probable cause is present). A consent form will be signed which indicates that the subject is aware of, and knowingly consents to, the drawing of blood or providing a urine sample for the purposes of determining the presence and amount of intoxicants in the blood. See Bodily Substance/Medical Examination Seizure Form. After samples are obtained, the requesting member will take possession and issue a Property Receipt.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Refusal to Consent: When injured DUII operators refuse to consent to the drawing of blood or the providing of a urine sample, members must base their case on the facts present in the same manner as if the individual was able but unwilling to consent to a breath examination. There are no operator license suspension sanctions for refusing to provide body fluids. Members may contact a member of the Traffic Division for assistance in determining the ability of pursuing a search warrant.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious Individuals and Those Incapable of Consenting: When probable cause exists and individuals are unconscious or in a state rendering them incapable of giving consent, ORS 813.140(2) allows for the taking of body fluids. A consent form will be completed, and the portion indicating that the subject was unconscious or incapable of giving consent will be completed. The requesting member will take possession of the sample and issue a property receipt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Non-Traffic Criminal Charges (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>In many instances, non-traffic criminal charges (i.e., assault, recklessly endangering, manslaughter) provide avenues for the seizing of body fluids. In such cases, contact a Traffic Division Major Crash Team supervisor for assistance with the investigation and possible search warrant preparation. Contact with a Major Crash Team supervisor may be made through BOEC.</p>
<p>In these situations, bodily substances or the results of medical examinations may be seized through consent of the individual or, if probable cause exists, through the exigent circumstance exceptions to the search warrant requirements. In such cases, it is not necessary that the subject be placed under arrest prior to the seizure.</p>
<p>ORS 133.621 provides civil immunity for licensed physicians or persons acting under their control or direction who withdraw body fluids, obtain substances, or perform medical tests and procedures to gather evidence in criminal investigations at the request of a police officer. This immunity is not conditioned upon the existence of probable cause or the existence of a search warrant or court order. Nothing in this section of law shall be interpreted as requiring such persons to act at the request of a police officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining Evidence (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>When determining that the collection of body fluids is appropriate, members will make their request to the medical personnel involved in the case. ORS 813.160(2) indicates that licensed physicians or qualified persons acting under their direction who withdraw bodily substances in a medically acceptable manner at the request of a police officer shall not be held civilly liable for their actions. Members desiring to draw blood will request that 10cc be collected in a gray stopper tube containing sodium fluoride. A nonalcoholic cleanser will be used to clean the surface area of the drawing. The presence of controlled substances and narcotics in body fluids is detected through urinalysis. Members requesting urinalysis should attempt to obtain a minimum 300cc sample. After samples are obtained, the requesting member(s) will take possession and issue a Property Receipt to the hospital.</p>
<p>During normal business hours, evidence will be delivered to the Oregon State Police Crime Lab. During non-business hours, members will use the refrigerators located in the JusticeCenter&rsquo;s lower level Property Room. Regardless of the placement of the evidence, an appropriate lab request form will be completed and left with the evidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DUII Report Processing (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>The following documents will be completed and/or included in all DUII cases:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;A Custody Report (to include detailed field sobriety tests).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;A DUII Interview Report.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;An Intoxilyzer Operator&rsquo;s Checklist and the Intoxilyzer Test Record (when the defendant submits to a breath test).</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;DMV&rsquo;s Implied Consent: Combined report, Notice of Intent to Suspend, and Temporary Driving Permit Form, if applicable.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The confiscated Oregon Operator&rsquo;s License (ODL) or Permit. Do not confiscate out-of-state drivers&rsquo; licenses.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Z-Cite.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;The Bodily Substance/Medical Examination Seizure Form, if applicable.</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;DMV DO-7 and Restriction 9-D33 printouts, if applicable.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Report(s) written by other members, if applicable.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp; &nbsp;Accident/Hit and Run Report(s), if applicable.</p>
<p>k. &nbsp;Property Receipts, if applicable.</p>
<p>l.&nbsp; &nbsp;Officer&rsquo;s court unavailability record.</p>
<p>All original documents, reports, printouts, all copies of the DMV Implied Consent Form with the ODL or permit (if confiscated) stapled to the front of the DMV Implied Consent Form, and a photocopy of the confiscated license or permit will be placed in the Traffic Case Envelope and forwarded to Records for distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Seizure of Operator Licenses (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>When a subject is cited for DWS/DWR and the person has presented an ODL to the member, the member will seize the ODL, issue a Property Receipt, and place the ODL in the Property Evidence Unit, either as evidence or for forwarding to DMV.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;If an ODL is seized as evidence, a Z-Cite for Using an Invalid License (ORS 807.580) may be issued, and the appropriate entry will be made on the Custody Report.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the license is seized for return to DMV, the member must write across the face of the PED Receipt, Forward to DMV. The Property/Evidence Division will forward all seized licenses, so noted, to DMV periodically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Juveniles (860.10)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Violations: All persons under 18 years of age will be arraigned for the following offenses using the Adult Circuit Court schedule.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Offenses defined in the Oregon Vehicle Code and relating to the use or operation of a motor vehicle.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;A boating offense.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;A game offense.</p>
<p>On all other offenses write &ldquo;TO BE DETERMINED&rdquo; on the bottom of the citation. Do not enter a date, time or location for court appearance. Bail will be indicated. Any violation citations issued in conjunction with traffic crimes will be attached to the traffic crime case.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Crimes: All persons under 18 years of age cited for traffic crimes will be issued a Z-Cite using the following procedures:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The word Juvenile will be printed on the top of the citation.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The parent(s) or guardian(s) name(s) will be printed in the right hand vertical margin Name section.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The appropriate arraignment information will be indicated.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;The Bail section will be left blank.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;A Custody or Special Report will be completed detailing the case.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;All citations will be attached to the written report and forwarded to Records. Following data entry, Records will forward the citations and a copy of the report to the Circuit Court.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing Persons/Runaway Juveniles (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>Calls regarding missing persons or runaway juveniles will be channeled to BOEC call takers. They will determine if a car will be dispatched to take a report or if the report will be taken by telephone. A car will be dispatched if the missing person:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Is in the company of another person under circumstance indicating that the disappearance was not voluntary or in the company of another person considered dangerous to the missing person.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Because of age, reported suicidal tendencies, physical or mental defect, there is a possibility of danger to the missing person or others.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been involved with the Reporting Party in any previously reported or suspected domestic violence or abuse (i.e., PPDS, LEDS/NCIC, or CAD history).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Is missing under suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Is a juvenile and has no history of runaway.</p>
<p>All reports of Missing Persons will require mandatory reporting. &nbsp;If a member declines a Missing Person report for any reason, including not meeting the specified criteria, the member shall complete a Special Report with a subject heading Missing Person Report Declined.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;There is no waiting period before accepting a report on a missing person. All juvenile/runaway and at-risk missing persons reports should be taken immediately.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Federal law prohibits any waiting period for entry of a missing child report. If an incident meets the criteria, a report will be completed without delay. Missing persons are to be documented on an Investigative Report.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Records Division (Records)/Teletype will be notified, as soon as practical, to facilitate having the missing person entered into LEDS/NCIC. It is possible to relay this information to teletype by radio using NE net.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should assign separate case numbers for each reported missing person, except in custodial interference cases or juvenile/runaway cases when the missing juvenile or runaway leaves with her own infant child. In these cases, all involved persons would be reported on the same report.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Members should advise the reporting party of the responsibility to contact the non-emergency number as soon as possible when the missing person is no longer missing (unless the missing person is contacted or returned by police, who would generate a Special Report and teletype notification.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a member clears a missing person report, the reporting member will contact Records/Teletype, as soon as practical, to have the person removed from LEDS/NCIC. It is possible to relay this information to teletype by radio using the NE net. The member will complete a Special Report documenting the clearance.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;Members will not clear any Missing Person report merely by the reporting party calling over the phone to request the clearance, when there has been any previously reported or suspected history of domestic violence or abuse between the reporting party and the missing person (i.e., PPDS, LEDS/NCIC or CAD history).</p>
<p>h. &nbsp;Members should either attempt to make contact with the missing person face-to-face or should make reasonable attempts to speak with the missing person over the phone, verifying the missing person&rsquo;s identity and welfare.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;Members may also rely on witness statements in verifying the missing person&rsquo;s welfare when direct contact with the missing person is not reasonable.</p>

<p>Members may be called upon to assist lost, disoriented or developmentally disabled adults in seeking their places of residence or shelter care facilities. In such situations, members will make every reasonable effort to locate the person&rsquo;s residence. This should include a PPDS check for a Disability Alert Flag (DAF). The DAF will be found under the PPDS MISC INFO heading, and indicates the presence of a PPDS file containing the names and telephone numbers of contact person(s) for certain developmentally disabled individuals. If those efforts fail, the member should consider contacting the Detective Division (Detectives), Missing Persons Detail (MPERS). MPERS maintains a database of reported chronic lost, disoriented or developmentally disabled persons, which may assist the member in identifying a person if the person&rsquo;s residence or an emergency contact cannot be located. Members should attempt to obtain shelter care for the person.</p>
<p>Following the transfer of the person to a facility, the member will complete a Special report noting the location or facility of final disposition. The Special Report will be forwarded to Records. Records will route a copy to MPERS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing Adults or Juveniles Under Suspicious Circumstances (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the reported missing person is an adult or juvenile missing under suspicious circumstances, the following procedure will be initiated:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will immediately advise a supervisor of the circumstances.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;If, after reviewing the circumstances, the supervisor believes it necessary, the description of the missing person will be immediately broadcast.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The supervisor will determine whether a block by block search is necessary.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is determined that a block by block search is necessary, the supervisor will notify the relief commander who will assign additional members as needed.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;The supervisor will notify the Detective Division&rsquo;s (Detectives) Homicide Detail supervisor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; The involved precinct will retain investigative responsibility unless foul play is reasonably suspected.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;If foul play is reasonably suspected, the Homicide Detail will assume control of the investigation.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor and the Homicide Detail supervisor will evaluate whether an activation of the Portland Emergency Notification System (PENS) is appropriate.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Refer to the PENS section of this Directive for further details.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will notify Records as soon as practical, with information on the missing person for LEDS/NCIC data entry. It is possible to relay this information to Teletype by radio using NE net.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copies of all associated reports should be faxed or, if no fax is available, sent via Interoffice Mail to the Detectives MPERS, prior to the end of shift.</p>
<p>k.&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding members should be aware that, in suspicious circumstances, the location the person is missing from may be a crime scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abducted or Suspected Abducted Adults or Juveniles (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the reported missing person has been abducted or is suspected to have been abducted, the following procedure will be initiated:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will immediately advise a supervisor of the circumstances.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;If, after reviewing the circumstances, the supervisor believes it is necessary, the description of the missing person will be immediately broadcast.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The supervisor will notify the Detectives Homicide detail supervisor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;If abduction is suspected, the Homicide Detail will respond to the scene and assume control of the investigation.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor and Homicide Detail supervisor will make a determination as to whether a block-by-block search is necessary.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is determined that a block-by-block search is necessary the supervisor will notify the relief commander who will assign additional members as needed.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;If the abducted or suspected abducted person is a juvenile (17 years of age or younger) the detective or other person designated by the Homicide Detail supervisor will evaluate whether the abduction meets the specific criteria for an Amber Alert.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Refer to the Amber Alert (850.39) section.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; The Homicide Detail supervisor, or his designee, will evaluate whether an activation of PENS is appropriate.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Refer to the PENS (850.39) section of this Directive for further details.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will notify Records as soon as possible with information on the missing person for entry into LEDS/NCIC. Information relating to an abducted or suspected abducted person will not be transmitted to Records/Teletype over any of the radio broadcast nets, due to the sensitive nature of the information.</p>
<p>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding members should be aware that, in an abduction or suspected abduction case, the location the person is missing from may be a crime scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing Child, No Suspicious Circumstances (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>In cases where a child is reported missing, but there are no suspicious circumstances involved:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will thoroughly search the location from where the child is reported missing, including bedrooms, closets, front and back yards, outbuildings and other areas where a child might be hiding. If the child is not located, the investigating member will immediately advise a supervisor of the circumstances.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The supervisor will determine if a block-by-block search is necessary.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;If it is determined that a block-by-block search is necessary, the supervisor will notify the relief commander who will assign additional members as needed.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The involved precinct will retain investigative responsibility as long as foul play is not reasonably suspected and there are no apparent suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisor will evaluate the circumstances to determine if activation of PENS is appropriate.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Refer to the PENS (850.39) section of this Directive for further details.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the child is not located within a reasonable period of time, the supervisor will contact the Detectives Homicide Detail supervisor.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Homicide Detail supervisor or designee will respond to the scene to provide assistance to the incident supervisor. Upon request of the RU manager, the Homicide Detail will assume command of the incident.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigating member will notify Records, as soon as practical, with information on the missing person for LEDS/NCIC data entry. It is possible to relay this information to Teletype by radio using NE net.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Missing Person is a Juvenile Runaway (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>In cases where the reported missing person is a juvenile runaway, the following procedure will be initiated:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Members will make a notation in the distribution box of the report form, directing a copy to the Family Services Division (FSD). Records will distribute a copy of the report(s) to the Juvenile Section of FSD. FSD will coordinate and conduct follow-up investigations on Juvenile Missing/ Runaway reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AMBER Alert (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>An Amber Alert System (AAS) activation shall only be authorized under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; There is reasonable belief that an abduction occurred, and the victim is a &nbsp;juvenile (i.e., 17 years of age or younger).</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; There is articulable information as to why the child is in danger of imminent bodily harm or death.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is adequate descriptive information available to believe that dissemination of that information to the public could help locate the juvenile, or the suspect or the suspect vehicle.</p>
<p>The AAS is not to be used in cases involving parental abduction (Custodial Interference), unless the juvenile is believed to be in imminent danger of bodily harm or death.</p>
<p>The AAS will only be activated after a member has had direct contact with a reporting party. Activation will not be based solely on a report to BOEC by a reporting party.</p>
<p>Authorization for an Amber Alert must be made directly to BOEC. Requests will be made by telephone, or in person, but not over the radio broadcast net. Members making a request will contact the BOEC Dispatch Coordinator (DC).</p>
<p>The AAS may be authorized only by a sworn member with a rank of sergeant, detective or above, or by a member acting under specific direction from a sworn member with a rank of sergeant, detective or above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Member Responsibilities, Amber Alert (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;BOEC:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) is responsible for coordinating an AMBER Alert. The DC will refer to and implement the current SOP 10.20.020 for an Amber Alert when an authorization for one is received.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The member making the request:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The member calling the DC with an authorization for an Amber Alert will provide the DC with the following information on the juvenile:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Name.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;Approximate age (date of birth if available).</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;Complete physical description (including clothing, scars, marks and tattoos).</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;Complete physical description of the suspect(s) (including clothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>e) &nbsp;Description of suspect vehicle or other mode of transportation.</p>
<p>f) &nbsp; Direction of travel.</p>
<p>g) &nbsp;Description of the abduction (brief summary of what occurred).</p>
<p>h) &nbsp;Additional information (officer safety, child endangered, etc.).</p>
<p>Until the Amber Alert activation request has been processed by BOEC, and the Amber Alert has been made public, no references to the Amber Alert will be made over any radio broadcast net.</p>
<p>Activation of the Amber Alert system does not, in any way, relieve members of any current response or investigative responsibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Updating an Amber Alert (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>An AAS activation is a time consuming and labor intensive procedure that will tax the capabilities of BOEC. Therefore, an Amber Alert shall be authorized only as long as it is deemed a productive and useful tool in attempting to locate the abducted child. The lead detective or supervisor involved with the investigation will be responsible for updates to and/or deactivation of the Amber Alert.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notification and Reporting Requirements for an Amber Alert (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>The supervisor granting the authorization for the AAS activation will ensure that the following notifications are made:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Prompt notification (through channels) to the appropriate Branch chief.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The Public Information Officer (PIO). This will ensure a properly managed media response and will assist with the dissemination of appropriate and accurate information.</p>
<p>An After Action Report will be completed, and forwarded through channels to the appropriate Branch chief, for every Amber Alert activation. The After Action Report will be completed by the incident supervisor in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the notification system, and to provide an overview of the time and resources expanded to complete the investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Portland</strong><strong> Emergency Notification System (PENS) (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>PENS delivers a recorded voice message to all available home-based phones lines within a targeted geographical area. PENS does not send TTY/TDD messages (for the hearing impaired). TTY/TDD users may still need to be contacted in person.</p>
<p>PENS is used to alert citizens of a life-threatening or property threatening incident in their area (i.e., police searching for a missing child, flood information). PENS will only be used from 0700 to 2200 hours for situations involving missing and/or suspicious persons; as its effectiveness is diminished during the hours the receiving parties will be asleep. PENS will be used at all hours for situations involving severe natural disasters and national emergencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Activation of PENS (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;The PENS server provider is located in the state of Louisiana, and should be used with discretion due to cost.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;PENS will be activated only by a RU manager or his/her designee. The designee must be a sworn member with a rank of sergeant or above.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;PENS may be activated by calling one of the following locations:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Police Information and Referral line (Police I&amp;R) from 0700-2200 Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;If the Police I&amp;R is closed, a mobile command center at the scene may be used; provided it is equipped with a laptop computer.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;If the Police I&amp;R is closed, and a mobile command center with a laptop computer is not available, the activation may be made directly to the service provider via phone. The server provider is First Call,. This option will only be used if the other options are not available, and/or the tactical situation warrants it.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;PENS takes time to organize so, if there is a chance PENS will be activated, the RU manager or designee should let the PENS operator know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;The RU manager or designee activates PENS by calling the appropriate PENS operator, and requesting a PENS activation.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; The RU manager or designee requesting the activation will provide the following information to the PENS operator:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Their name.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;A fax number where the report is to be sent if different than the preset one.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Define the Geographical area to be notified. This may be done in one of four ways:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Using a block grid (as if setting up a perimeter for a block search).</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;By geographical boundaries such as freeways or rivers.</p>
<p>c) &nbsp;By a combination of block grids and geographical boundaries. d) &nbsp;By designating a radius from a specific address.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Fax a typed copy of the outgoing message to the PENS operator.</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;Keep the outgoing message as short as possible, since longer messages require more time and resources to complete.</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;If a fax is not available, the PENS operator will take the outgoing message, verbally over the phone; but it may delay the activation of PENS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Closure of PENS (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;At the conclusion of the incident, the shift commander will re-contact the PENS operator to activate a closure message.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Refer to the incident number to begin the closure routine.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure message will be sent to the phone numbers that received the outgoing message.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;The closure message should be informative to the public, and, if possible, explain the reason for the original message. The message should be brief and to the point while thanking the citizens for their cooperation.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;The PIO can assist in the formation of the message, and keep the information coordinated.</p>
<p>f. &nbsp; If the incident is concluded between 2200 and 0700 hours, the PIO can forward the closure message through the local media instead of incurring the cost of PENS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Requirements of Using PENS</strong></p>
<p>The on-scene supervisor will complete an After Action Report at the conclusion of the PENS incident. The After Action Report will include, but is not limited to, the following information:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Type of incident.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Time of day.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Area covered by the activation (i.e., 10 block radius from 123 NE Anywhere street).</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Did the message system save him/her from deploying more officers? If not, why?</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;In his/her opinion did the system work well in the situation? If not, why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Requests for Fingerprinting/Photographing of Incapacitated Subjects (850.39)</strong></p>
<p>If a member receives a request from a local hospital for assistance in attempting to identify a subject who is currently in the hospital&rsquo;s care, through fingerprinting and/or photographing of the subject, and for whom, no other reasonable means of identifying the person in a timely manner is available, the member may assist in facilitating the request under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The request must originate from a local, licensed hospital, and must be only for the purposes of attempting to identify a subject who is currently unconscious, medically incapacitated or otherwise incapable of communicating with hospital staff.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The request must be related to the hospital&rsquo;s attempts to identify the subject in order to more specifically address the person&rsquo;s emergent medical condition, notify next-of-kin, or identify a possible missing person.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The request must be approved by a member with the rank of sergeant, detective or above.</p>
<p>Members may use portable IBIS fingerprint technology, in addition to traditional fingerprinting techniques and photography, in order to identify subjects meeting the above criteria, provided the inquiry is not intended for criminal investigative purposes.</p>
<p>If an inquiry results in the positive identification of a subject, either by fingerprint (verified by a qualified member of the Forensics Evidence Division) or by photograph (verified by the officer), the member may provide the identified subject&rsquo;s information to the hospital. This includes:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Name, date of birth, physical descriptors.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Known addresses and phone numbers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Known family members and family contact information.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Member&rsquo;s responsibility in attempting to assist a hospital in identifying a person is limited to providing the hospital the above information, when available.</p>
<p>Members will check the subject in LEDS/NCIC to determine if the subject has been entered as a Missing Person.</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;If a member identifies a subject as a Missing Person, the member will notify the originating agency of the subject&rsquo;s status, by contacting PPB teletype to clear or send a &ldquo;locate&rdquo; on the Missing Person hit.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will not contact family members or associates of the subject directly, unless specifically authorized by a Missing Persons Unit (MPERS) detective.</p>
<p>Any time a member responds to a hospital and photographs and/or fingerprints any individual at the request of hospital staff, the member will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Write a Special Report documenting the name and contact information of the staff member making the request, the reason for the request, the member&rsquo;s actions taken and the results.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The report shall be sent to the Records Division and will be forwarded to MPERS.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Members will fax a copy of the report to MPERS and leave a detailed message for a MPERS detective prior to the end of shift for routine results, or immediately contact a MPERS detective, or the On-Call Homicide supervisor, via BOEC, if the situation may involve a high-profile case or may necessitate immediate detective involvement.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/530942

</ul>
<p><strong>POLICY (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>Members may take a person who is in a public place into custody with or without the presence of a criminal charge if the subject is intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. Under no circumstances may an individual who is only intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance be placed in custody while inside a private residence.</p>
<p>Members may act in such situations by taking or sending the subject home or to a detoxification center such as the HooperMemorialCenter (Detox).</p>
<p>Members locating, or being called to deal with, incapacitated inebriates in public places will check the physical condition of the person for:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Visible injury.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Breathing and a normal rate of respiration.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Normal skin color.</p>
<p>If these physical conditions appear normal, the member will attempt to rouse the person to consciousness. If any of those factors appear abnormal or the person cannot be roused within 30 seconds, the member will then call EMS to respond. Members will stand by until EMS is prepared to transport or declares there is no medical danger. In all instances, the member will stand by any person they determine is unable to make a rational decision. If CHIERS (Central City Concern-Hooper Inebriate Emergency Response Service) is not available or delayed, the member will transport the person to Detox.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>When a member has contact with a person exhibiting any of the following conditions, they will see that the subject is taken into custody and transported to an appropriate treatment facility:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;There is an immediate danger to the subject&rsquo;s health caused by alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;There is an immediate danger to others due to the subject&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The subject is suicidal.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;When, in the opinion of the member, the subject is unable to make rational decisions concerning acceptance of assistance (incapacitated).</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;The subject is intoxicated and an insulin-using diabetic.</p>
<p>Regardless of the level of sobriety, if a person&rsquo;s physical condition is such that immediate medical attention is required, members must call for an ambulance or cab to transport the subject to the appropriate medical facility.</p>
<p>Individuals who meet the criteria for a police emergency mental committal will not be admitted to a sobering program even though they are intoxicated. Intoxicated/disoriented persons exhibiting signs of being either mentally or emotionally disturbed, but not meeting the criteria allowing for a police committal, may be admitted to Detox. If, after being placed in Detox, it is determined that a person is suicidal, that person will be removed to an appropriate facility by the admitting member.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criminal Charges (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>Intoxicated subjects arrested on criminal charges will either be booked into MCDC or issued the appropriate citation and lodged in Detox. Inebriates who are violent and/or combative, but to the member&rsquo;s knowledge have not committed any criminal acts, will be lodged in Detox.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Detox Admission Process (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>The following procedure will be used when invoking a civil hold:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;All subjects taken into custody under the treatment act will be restrained and transported as directed in DIR 870.20.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Upon arriving at Detox, members may use the weapons locker provided in the admitting area.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;A Detox staff person will receive, identify and assess the subject&rsquo;s behavior. If not needed by the staff, the member may use the police desk to complete the report.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Detox staff person will confer with the member(s) regarding the appropriate disposition for the inebriate. The member(s) may be requested to remain at Detox until the subject is placed in a sobering room or, if unruly, for the remainder of the admitting process.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;The Detox staff will determine if the subject is to be placed in a safety room. A search will be conducted by the Detox staff. Unruly subjects will be restrained by the member(s) during the search. If illegal weapons or contraband are found, the admission process will be terminated. The subject will be arrested and either issued a citation or removed to MCDC. If removed to MCDC, a Seen But Not Admitted Detox form will be completed.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the staff search, if admittance to Detox is to occur and the subject is unruly, they will be moved by both the staff and the member(s) to a safety room. At this time, the handcuffs will be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Removal of Subjects from Detox (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>If a subject placed in Detox is uncooperative and an involuntary transport to another facility becomes necessary, a Detox employee will call 9-1-1 to request the presence of a patrol unit for transport. If the member who admitted the person into Detox is not available, the closest free unit will be dispatched. Prior to leaving the center, the referral facility must be confirmed by the Detox staff. Voluntary committals requiring transfer to another facility are the responsibility of Detox. When requested to remove violent or combative persons from Detox, members will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Respond to Detox using an appropriate driving response.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Take appropriate action to safeguard Detox staff and clients.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Assist the staff in restraining violent or combative individuals.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Ensure that the Detox staff has confirmed acceptance of the individual in an alternate facility.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Conduct the transport or use an ambulance with restraints.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Requirements (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>All civil holds will be documented on an Investigation Report. The narrative will contain information that justifies the hold. A copy of the report will be presented to the Detox staff prior to departure. The completed original will be routed to Records through normal channels. Regardless of disposition, a records check will be conducted prior to releasing the individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CHIERS (850.10)</strong></p>
<p>The CHIERS program provides for first responder assistance for certain medical emergencies and transport of incapacitated inebriates to Detox by HooperCenter staff members. Most CHIERS operators are emergency medical technician certified and deputized with authority limited to the pick up and transport of incapacitated individuals who cannot stand or walk unassisted and who are a danger to themselves as a result of their intoxicated condition. CHIERS cannot transport combative individuals.</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/530931

<p><strong>POLICY (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>Members may act on behalf of the owners of private and public subsidized premises if the procedures and criteria described in this directive have been established by the premise owner before a member acts. These procedures will specifically detail how members are authorized to act as persons in charge on private premises, as defined in ORS 164.205(5), and will only apply to the enforcement of trespass procedures under ORS 164.245.</p>
<p>Members will be trained and certified in the application of this procedure prior to becoming persons in charge.</p>
<p>Members are reminded that landlord tenant laws apply in all cases involving tenants, and landlords should be encouraged to follow the established procedures for eviction (F.E.D., 72 hours and 30-day evictions, etc.).</p>
<p>Nothing in this order removes a member&rsquo;s ability to act when dealing with other criminal matters observed on private premises during the course of his/her duties.</p>
<p>Due to periodic court rulings, parts of this directive may not apply. Members will follow the most recent updates issued to members by the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (850.00)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>Criteria for exclusion: A list of non-constitutionally protected behaviors compiled by the controlling agent or owner of a premise upon violation of which a nonresident may be excluded from the common areas of the premises.</p>
<p>Exclusion Maintenance File (EMF): A file maintained at precinct level on hard copy and/or computer disc, and monitored and updated by a person or persons designated by the precinct commander. This file will reflect the same material as outlined in the TCO&rsquo;s file and pertain to the private premises within the precinct jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Multifamily housing premise: A large apartment or other complex providing multi-housing units to tenants and generally having common ground areas in between the units: parking lots, courtyards, and play areas designed for use of tenants.</p>
<p>Nonresident: Any person who does not lawfully reside on the premises.</p>
<p>Person in charge: A representative or employee of the person who has lawful control of premises by ownership, tenancy, official position or other legal relationship.</p>
<p>Premise: Any building, real property, and/or common area whether privately or publicly owned. Premises will not be meant to include City of Portland public rights of way such as public streets and public sidewalks adjacent thereto.</p>
<p>Trespass Control Officer (TCO): An individual designated by the controlling agent or owner of a premises who has the authority to process criminal trespass complaints. The TCO will also arrange for, and/or act as, a hearing officer to those individuals seeking appeal of trespass notices. The TCO will also maintain and update necessary files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Landlord/Owner/Agent in Charge Responsibilities (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>The owner or agent in charge of a premises (legally designated as such) should reassert control over all areas deemed common areas within the complex; (i.e., laundry rooms, common courtyards, private sidewalks, hallways, etc.). This should be specifically detailed in all rental contracts and leases. This is known as the Lease Enabling Provision. The assertion of control by owner (usually left out of leases) is to ensure the owner is the person in charge of these common areas under ORS 164.205(5). An example of a lease enabling provision is: &ldquo;The (premises corporation, landlord or owner&rsquo;s name) retains control over any common areas of the (name of premises) for the purposes of enforcing state trespass laws and shall be the person in charge for that purpose as that phrase is defined in ORS 164.205(5).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The addition of this provision to the lease or contract must apply to all new tenants. In order to ensure current tenants are also notified of the owner&rsquo;s claim to the common areas, the owner or their agent should have all current tenants sign a similar provision. They will also have to follow any and all in-house and possible statutory rules for changing leases, contracts, etc.</p>
<p>In addition to the lease enabling procedure, landlords should also include an enabling procedure sufficient to prohibit individuals from establishing residency without prior landlord approval.</p>
<p>In that this suggested procedure may affect the rights and obligations of the parties in the existing lease/rental agreements, landlords should always be referred to a private attorney for any review of amendments or enabling provisions to the new lease/rental agreements.</p>
<p>The landlord may enable the manager alone to be the person in charge for trespass purposes. If members are to be allowed to make arrests for trespass on behalf of the owner, the owner or their designee must also empower the Bureau&rsquo;s members to act as persons in charge upon their premises for the purpose of enforcing trespass laws. This is to be done by a formal letter written to the Chief of Police or precinct commander authorizing the sworn members of the Bureau to act in the described manner.</p>
<p>The premises owner or their agents will include, along with the above letter, a Criteria for Exclusion agreed to by the owner(s) as grounds to exclude nonresidents from their premises. These criteria can include a variety of obnoxious, violent, or dangerous activities. It should not, however, be so limited in scope as to be ineffective in addressing the nonresident&rsquo;s behavior these procedures are to address.</p>
<p>The premises owner or their agents will then assign a TCO. This assignment will consist of a formal document authorizing a particular person, on behalf of the owner, to act as the TCO. The TCO will process the exclusion forms, usually on site or at a local office, and ensure that a current file is maintained of excluded persons. The TCO will also receive appeal requests by excluded parties. The TCO will notify the precinct whenever an appeal on an exclusion is pending. The TCO will also notify the appropriate members immediately of any persons excluded from the premises that were successful in their appeal process. The notification by the TCO to the person controlling the precinct EMF must be by telephone within 48 to 72 hours, followed by a letter to the precinct confirming any modifications or voiding of the exclusion. These notifications will always be the responsibility of the landlords or their designee. In addition, the TCO will give formal documentation to the successful appellant indicating they can return to the premises. The TCO will advise the successful appellant to carry the documentation on their person.</p>
<p>The owner or their designee will provide a camera and film, a supply of trespass forms and a place where a list of current excluded persons can be posted at each premise. They will also supply detailed maps of their premises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exclusion Process - Sworn Member Responsibilities (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;When a member responds to the participating premises and has reasonable suspicion to believe that:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The person to be contacted is a nonresident.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person has violated the criteria for exclusion on the premises or is violating the criteria for exclusion on the premises, and then the member is empowered to contact the nonresident and advise the nonresident of the violation of the criteria for exclusion. Unless the nonresident violator has committed a criminal offense for which a detention, stop, or arrest may be made, as discussed below, the contact by the member is limited to mere conversation.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is then empowered to complete the exclusion form specifically detailing the justification for the exclusion.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Arrests for offenses and issuance of exclusion form: When making an arrest for an offense, the member will complete the necessary reports (Custody, Investigation, etc.). If the member decides to exclude the person as well, a Special Report outlining the exclusion for each person arrested will be completed and attached to the Exclusion Form. These documents will be forwarded to Records along with all other reports related to the incident. The member will forward one copy of the Special Report and Exclusion Form to the person assigned to the precinct EMF and one copy to the private premises TCO.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exclusions issued without arrests: In these cases a member will file a Special Report and attach the Exclusion Form with the same distribution as above. Members may exclude multiple persons on one Special report when no arrest is made on any one individual (see above).</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Report requirements.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; In each Special Report written concerning the original exclusion, the member will write in the Location of Occurrence box only the landmark designation. If, on private premises other than HAP premises, the landmark designation will be PPE (name of complex). PPE will be the designation for Private Property Exclusion. Members will not include the mailing address in the formatted boxes of the report.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; In addition, when coding the excluded person on the original Special Report the members should use the code EX in place of SB or A1, etc.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;In all other subsequent reports related to the exclusion (i.e., trespass arrest with Custody and Investigation Reports), the mailing address is to be used rather than the landmark designation.</p>
<p>d) &nbsp;Additionally, members should make an effort to refer the trespass arrest to the original exclusion case number.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;These reporting procedures will standardize PPDS data processing and provide clear and concise computer printouts. This becomes important when determining who is excluded from a premise. It is also necessary for the timely updating of files and site lists for both members and managers.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;The member will then provide the excluded person a map of the premises he or she is excluded from. This is to ensure that there is no confusion later as to where the individual was not allowed to return.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;The member will take a photograph of the excluded person and include it with a copy of the exclusion form for the on-site office (usually the manager&rsquo;s office). The member will notify the excluded person of his/her right to appeal the exclusion which is noted on the back of the form.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;It must be emphasized, unless the person to be excluded is also to be arrested for a criminal offense, the member has no legal authority to detain the person to be excluded under the following examples:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The person to be excluded observes the approaching member and flees the premises.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The person to be excluded, during mere conversation, refuses to identify themselves. Even though no right to identify them exists, they can, nonetheless, still be excluded. In these examples, a member can still shout the exclusion to the fleeing person; or, can tell the person to be excluded who refuses identification, that he/she is not allowed to return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trespass Arrest Process (850.00) Refer to DIR 830.00.</strong></p>
<p>If a member observes a person known to be excluded from a premise, a criminal trespass arrest may be made. The member will process the trespass arrest in the usual manner with the following additions:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;The member will attach a copy of the premises map to the report. An (X) will be placed on the map specifically showing where the person was on the common areas of the premises at the time of the arrest.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Copies of the reports will be forwarded to the complaint signer, EMF and TCO.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;This person has been excluded from the common areas on private premises under the new authority of a person in charge for this private premise. Therefore, the person can only be arrested for criminal trespass if he/ she is trespassing on that private premise. If the individual is on a public street or public sidewalk adjacent to the private premises, an arrest is not lawful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Records/Data Processing (ITD) Requirements (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>Records will make the necessary entries and assign PPDS offense codes. Members can retrieve information on excluded persons from PPDS by accessing the Address Search format and typing in the landmark name and the qualifier. For HAP premises the landmark will be Housing Authority of Portland. The qualifier will be the name of the premises. On all other private premises, the landmark will be Private Property and the qualifier will be the name of the apartment. The name of apartment will be decided upon at the time the private premises signs up for these procedures. The name selected needs to remain consistent for data entry and inquiry. While members can abbreviate Housing Authority of Portland to HAP or Private Property to PPE on their Special Reports, to have computer access and retrieval, members must spell the landmark and qualifiers exactly as shown.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Precinct Responsibilities (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Each precinct will maintain an EMF. The Commander will designate a specific person for this task.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The file will include every exclusion for a specific premise.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The EMF will be updated to reflect any exclusions which are expunged by an appeal process as notified by the TCO.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;When requested, the EMF may be printed daily for members involved with specific premises. This list should be sent to, and maintained at, the on-site office of the premise in question.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If desired, the EMF may be put into the precinct&rsquo;s personal computer for ease of retrieval and updating.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMF designee will maintain contact with the TCO to ensure that a current list is maintained.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;The EMF designee will maintain contact with the complaint signer to ensure their list is current.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;The EMF designee will forward copies of successful appeals to Records for PPDS update. The EMF designee will also write a Special Report for all insufficient cases in order to clear the involved persons from the PPDS exclusion file.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;The precinct may wish to pursue involvement in the appeals process, as outlined by the owner of the premise and carried out by the TCO.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The precinct commander will create a return letter to any premise owner who requests to use these procedures. The letter will include:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The names of the people assigned in the precinct to coordinate with the owners TCO.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A request to have the premise owner&rsquo;s private attorney review these matters.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;A notice that any civil issues raised by these procedures are the responsibility of the owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Complaint Signer Responsibilities (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>The complaint signer will:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Maintain files of all involved premises to include:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A letter of empowerment authorizing sworn members to act as persons in charge of particular premises sites for the purpose of enforcing criminal trespass laws.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;A letter of declaration outlining the criteria for exclusion.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;A legal designation by the premises owner assigning a TCO.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;A return letter by the precinct commander.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Maps of all involved premises.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Keep a file of all copies of the Custody, Investigation or Special Reports with their corresponding exclusion reports.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Maintain a list of excluded persons for each premises.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Maintain contact with the precinct person in charge of the EMF to ensure they have the same updated lists.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can sign the necessary complaints for trespass arrests by members when such a process has been set up with the DA&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Will send the DA two (2) copies of:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The foundation papers (see proceeding).</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The original exclusion form and the supporting police reports.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The current trespass reports.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;A copy of the premise map marked (X) where the arrestee was at the time of arrest.</p>
<p>While these procedures were designed specifically to address the problems non-tenants bring to larger apartment complexes, members should remember this process can be adapted to other applications. For example, this procedure has been used in part, to control aberrant behavior in shopping malls and businesses within congested business zones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Criteria for Exclusion from (Name of Premises) (850.00)</strong></p>
<p>Any non-resident will be directed to leave and may be barred from returning to the premises within which that person:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Makes unreasonable noise.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Engages in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Substantially interferes with any right, comfort or convenience of any (name of premises) resident or employee.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Engages in any activity that constitutes a criminal offense.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;Damages, defaces or destroys any property belonging to (name of premises) or a (name of premises) resident or employee.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp; &nbsp;Litters on (name of premises) premises.</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;Drives in a careless or reckless manner.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumes or possesses an open container of any alcoholic beverage on the common areas without being accompanied (meaning actual physical presence) by an adult (21 years or older) resident of that development.</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; &nbsp;Violates the City&rsquo;s curfew ordinances.</p>
<p>Any person who fails to leave the premises after being directed to do so, or who returns to the premises after being given such direction, will be subject to arrest and prosecution for Criminal Trespass under ORS 164.245.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/530928

<p><strong>840.00&nbsp; &nbsp;ARREST WITH WARRANT&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (840.00)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Directive Specific Definitions</strong></p>
<p>An arrest warrant: An order in writing, in the name of the state, signed by a magistrate with his/her name of office, commanding the arrest of the defendant.</p>
<p>An arrest warrant must specify the name of the defendant. If unknown, the defendant may be designated by a fictitious name with a statement therein that his true name is unknown. An arrest warrant must also state a crime in respect to which the magistrate has authority to issue the warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining an Arrest Warrant (840.00)</strong></p>
<p>A complainant or an investigator will appear before a deputy district attorney and justify the complaint.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;All felony complaints will be handled either by the Detective Division, or by the complainant.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a felony complaint, an investigator may accompany the complainant to the District Attorney&rsquo;s office and assist if necessary.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;The investigator may, with the concurrence of a deputy district attorney, justify a felony complaint without the complainant being present.</p>
<p>If justified, an affidavit will be:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Prepared by a deputy district attorney or investigator.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Signed by the complainant or investigator.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Notarized.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Sent to a magistrate.</p>
<p>In felony cases, complainants or investigators will accompany the affidavit and swear an oath before the magistrate. The magistrate will examine the affidavit and, if justified, will issue an arrest warrant. On a felony complaint, the district attorney will have the option of bypassing the magistrate and submitting the complaint directly to the Grand Jury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrest Warrant Processing Responsibilities (840.00)</strong></p>
<p>The Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (MCSO) is responsible for the physical maintenance of all warrants within MultnomahCounty. They will ensure the entry, modification and clearance of warrants into the computer, publish a computer printout of Warrants on File by Precinct and also a Notice of Warrant on File record card. The record card will be used to record the attempt or service of a warrant.</p>
<p>The Bureau restricts warrant service to the following guidelines:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Major Warrants (felony, Class A misdemeanor, and major traffic offense warrants) can be served on any day, at any hour, when the defendant can be found.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; Minor Warrants (Class B and C misdemeanor, violations, traffic infractions, warrants, etc.) will generally be served during hours that will minimize the inconvenience to the defendant.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceptions, caused by unusual circumstances, require approval by an immediate supervisor.</p>
<p>The Bureau will actively undertake the service of arrest warrants issued within the City. The MCSO will deliver daily to the Bureau&rsquo;s Records Division, Mail Distribution Section, envelopes addressed to the appropriate precincts. The envelopes will contain computer-produced listings of Warrants on File Notices issued the previous day and a Warrant on File Record card for each entry.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Precinct commanders will be responsible for the maintenance of the Warrant File Notices computer listing. The computer listings will be retained by each Precinct for thirty (30) days and will reflect the following information:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The assignment of the Notice of Warrant on File card to a relief officer and the date of assignment.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The final disposition, whether served or an attempt of service is made, and the date.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The date the warrant card is sent back to MCSO (must be ten (10) days of date assigned).</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Assigned district officers will make at least one documented attempt to serve the assigned warrant. The attempt will be noted in the space provided at the bottom of the Notice of Warrant on File card.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Members attempting service of a warrant will verify its status, prior to making an arrest, by MDC, radio or telephone to MCSO warrants base. Verification can be made by members directly or through precinct/unit members.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warrant has been confirmed and the member feels confident the checked subject is the person named on the warrant, the requesting member will complete the arrest procedure and transport the arrested subject to the appropriate booking facility.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There is no need for the arresting member to physically serve the verified warrant on the arrested subject. The warrant will be served by MCSO staff during the booking process.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Unless exceptional circumstances dictate otherwise, members will not pick up warrants from MCSO.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Arresting members will not accept bail money or issue receipts to persons attempting to post bail. The arrested subject will be transported to MCDC for purposes of either posting bail or booking. Where specified on the warrant, a citation in lieu of custody may be issued.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;If the county warrant stipulates that a citation-in-lieu-of-custody can be written, and there are no other bookable charges, the arresting member may issue a citation-in-lieu-of-custody. The member must advise MCSO warrants base of the issuance of such as soon as possible.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Members will complete the Notice of Warrant on File Card by noting the served date, time, the name of the serving member and the DPSST number. It will be routed directly to MCSO Detention and Warrant Records by precinct/division members.</p>
<p>In those instances where a member determines a subject has moved to a new address within the city, a supervisor&rsquo;s approval may be requested for travel to another precinct to continue the apprehension effort. The Notice of Warrant on File Card may be transferred to another precinct if the precinct&rsquo;s computer produced Warrant Notice List is updated to reflect the transfer. In all cases, the cards must be returned within ten (10) days to the MCSO.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/530925

<p><strong>Refer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>City Code 20.12.210&nbsp; Hours of Park Closure</li>
<li>City Code 20.12.215&nbsp; Parks may be closed if deemed necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>POLICY (835.10)</strong></p>
<p>Park closures will be instituted under this city ordinance only in those instances when the situation is beyond the control of available police resources to manage by arrest or exclusion of individuals. The situation must be serious and widespread before a park closure can occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>PROCEDURE (835.10)</strong></p>
<p>Members (as well as park officials) have the authority to close any city park, or any part thereof, if one or more of the following conditions exist in that park:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Life or property appears to be endangered and other means cannot reasonably be used to eliminate the danger.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;The overcrowding of persons or vehicles has occurred so that necessary access for emergency assistance or emergency vehicles is unavailable.</p>
<p>c. &nbsp;Park property or other property located near the park reasonably appears to be endangered.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;A hazardous or physically offensive state exists and is caused by sufficient numbers of persons so that other means of control cannot reasonably be used to eliminate the condition. Examples of these kinds of widespread behavior and conditions are:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Loud and unreasonable noise.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Fighting.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Violent, tumultuous or threatening behavior.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Abusive, obscene language or gestures.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Violation(s) of criminal offenses or ordinances.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;Other conditions which exist where the safety of persons or property can not reasonably be assured.</p>
<p>When it has been determined that a park closure is necessary in the interests of public health, peace and safety, members shall relate the facts of the situation to a supervisor and obtain specific authorization to enforce a park closure. The supervisor who authorizes the closure shall notify the precinct commander of the closure.</p>
<p>The precinct commander shall then notify the Chief of Police, through channels, of the closure and circumstances. The precinct commander shall also notify the Commissioner of the PortlandParks and Recreation (Parks) and the Supervisor of Parks that a decision has been made to close a park. Notification of Parks may be achieved by contacting BOEC and asking for a Parks Crisis Management Team and by leaving a voicemail message for the Parks Commissioner and the Parks Director. The Parks Operations phone number is available in the Problem Solving Resource Guide. Following closure, the supervisor who authorized the closure will write a Special Report. This report will detail the circumstances, which caused the decision to close the park. A copy of this report plus any appropriate attachments will be directed through channels to Parks.</p>
<p>A park closure instituted under City Code 20.12.215 will remain in effect only for the length of time necessary to preserve the public health, peace and safety. In no event will a park closure extend beyond eighteen (18) hours without written approval of the Commissioners of the Police Bureau and Parks. Such a request for an extension will be made by the involved precinct commander, through channels.&nbsp;</p>",https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/530922

<p><strong>Arrest and Citations-in-Lieu-of-Custody Stemming from Criminal Actions</strong></p>
<p>A sworn member may make a custody arrest of a person, without a warrant, if the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed any of the following:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Felony.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;Misdemeanor.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;An unclassified offense for which the maximum penalty allowed by law is equal to or greater than the maximum penalty allowed for a Class C misdemeanor.</p>
<p>d. &nbsp;Any other crime committed in the officer&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>e. &nbsp;A violation of Restraining Order or Domestic Violence.</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; A violation of any order or agreement referenced in ORS 133.310.</p>
<p>g.&nbsp; Acts requiring arrest under ORS 133.055.</p>
<p>h.&nbsp; A violation of a condition of probation.</p>
<p>A member may make an arrest inside a place of privacy (a residence) if the member enters, or has entered, in a legal manner (i.e., consent, execution of a warrant, etc.). A member may enter a place of privacy without a warrant to effect an arrest if it can be shown that there is objective evidence, and the member holds a good faith belief that the suspect and/or evidence will be lost or there is a real risk to some other person&rsquo;s safety if the member were to take the time to obtain a search warrant. If these circumstances do not exist, the member must obtain a search and/ or arrest warrant, as appropriate, to authorize the entry and arrest.</p>
<p>A peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant when the peace officer is notified by teletype, radio, or other mode of communication by another peace officer of any state that there exists a duly issued warrant for the arrest of a person within the other peace officer&rsquo;s jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Peace officers may also arrest a person without a warrant when notified of the existence of duly issued federal warrants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Z-Cites and C-Cites (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Z-Cites should be issued for violations and any misdemeanor that is not accepted for booking at the Multnomah County Detention Center. &nbsp;Z-Cites may be issued for misdemeanors that are accepted for booking with prior supervisor approval.</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;C-Cites will be used whenever possible for Class C Felonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrests for Violating a Condition of Probation (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>Members may only make a probable cause arrest of a person for violating a condition of probation imposed by the county court in the State of Oregon.&nbsp; Members may not arrest for violating a condition of a person&rsquo;s parole, probation or post-prison supervision imposed by the State of Oregon, another state&rsquo;s agencies or courts, or federal agencies or courts, without a detainer or warrant first being issued by a court or parole or probation officer.</p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedures for Attempted PCS I and PCS II Charges (830.00):</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;All PCS I and PCS II charges that involve only residue quantities will be referred to the District Attorney&rsquo;s Office as misdemeanors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Identification Procedures for Persons to be Issued C-Cites (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>If the member has a reasonable doubt as to the true identity of the person, the member will follow the procedures outlined in DIR 860.30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Escaped Prisoners &ndash; Authority and Means of Retaking (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>If a lawfully arrested person escapes, the person pursuing may use any means and do any act necessary and proper as in making the original arrest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arrest in Personal Quarrels (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>Members will not make arrests or issue citations in their own quarrels, nor those of their families or neighbors, except under grave circumstances (i.e., when the use of self-defense is justified). Members will notify the agency responsible for the jurisdiction in which the event is occurring in order that officers may be dispatched to investigate and take the necessary action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Off-Duty Arrests (830.00)</strong></p>
<p>If possible, off-duty sworn members should make an arrest when a crime is being committed in their presence, if life or property is threatened, or if the situation is of an emergency nature that cannot wait for the arrival of on-duty officers.

<p class=""Default"">2.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Photo Lineup:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.1. About Photo Lineup:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.1.1. When a photo lineup is used for suspect identification, a blind or blinded sequential presentation should be used whenever reasonably possible; consequently, the procedures that appear below are designed primarily for blind or blinded sequential presentations. If another photo lineup method is used, including a simultaneous presentation or a sequential presentation that is not blind or blinded, the reason(s) for using that method should be documented.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2. Development of a Photo Lineup:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.1. Members should obtain a thorough suspect description from each witness before developing a photo lineup. (Note that differing suspect descriptions among the witnesses may require the presentation of different photo lineups to different witnesses.)&nbsp; See Preliminary Checklist &ldquo;information to gather before any identification process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.2. A photo lineup shall consist of no fewer than six (6) photographs, including one (1) of the suspect.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.3. All photos should be similarly sized and should be of similar-appearing individuals.&nbsp; None should be obviously different from the others.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.3.1. Filler photographs (not of a suspect) should generally match, to the extent reasonably possible, the particular witness&rsquo; description of the suspect.&nbsp; Because filler photographs and&nbsp; witness descriptions of the suspect may vary from each other to some degree, it is permissible for filler photographs to differ from each other and from the suspect&rsquo;s photo or description, so long as the differences do not make the suspect&rsquo;s photo or description disproportionately stand out from the others.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.3.2. When there is a limited or insufficient suspect description, or when the witness&rsquo; description of the suspect differs significantly from the available photograph(s) of the suspect, the filler photographs should resemble the suspect photograph, not the description.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.4. The photos shall be numbered and in individual folders or envelopes attached to opaque backing such as light cardboard or equivalent.&nbsp; The number on the photo should be placed so that the presenter cannot see it when presenting in a &ldquo;blinded presentation.&rdquo; (See process below, Section 2.3.3.).</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.2.5. When conducting a single lineup for multiple witnesses, the photographs should be presented to each witness in a different sequence.&nbsp; Another alternative is a random or shuffled presentation for each witness.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a random or shuffled presentation is used, the order of presentation should be recorded afterwards.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3. Presentation of Photo Lineup: &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.1. Instructions to Witnesses:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.1.1. Prior to a presentation, the presenter shall read the witness instructions from the Eyewitness Identification form, ensuring and documenting that the witness understands the instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.2. Blind Presentation:&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.2.1. In a blind presentation, the identity of the suspect is not known to the presenter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.2.2. The presenter shall present the photos to the witness sequentially, with one photo replacing another so that no two are presented at the same time. After each photo is presented, the presenter will ask: &ldquo;Is this the person you saw?,&rdquo; before presenting the next photo and the answer will be documented.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.2.3. The presenter shall present each photo to the witness, even if the witness identifies a photo as the suspect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.2.4. If, during the same presentation, the witness asks to see one or more photos again, the presenter may conduct the same presentation a second time but must present all of the photos, using the same method and order of presentation. If the witness gives a different answer as to a particular photo(s), then the witness will be asked to explain the reason for the change.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3. Blinded Presentation:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1. See also the steps for presenting photos under &ldquo;Blind Presentation,&rdquo; above.&nbsp; These steps should be followed as modified below.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1. If the presenter knows who the suspect is, an extra measure of care should be taken to prevent the presenter from knowing which photo is being shown to the witness as the process occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1.1. One option is for the photos to be placed in identical folders or envelopes, with the folders or envelopes numbered inside and shuffled. Each photo shall then be presented so that only the witness can see the photo; the presenter is thus &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; to the process and it cannot, therefore, be suggestive.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1.2. A second option for &ldquo;blinded&rdquo; presentation is for the photos to be adhered to equally-sized and shaped pieces of opaque material (such as light cardboard) to create &ldquo;cards,&rdquo; with each card containing one photograph.&nbsp; The cards shall be numbered on front, so that the presenter cannot see the number.&nbsp; These cards will then be shuffled, face-down, and presented so that only the witness can see the photo.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1.3. Equivalent methods to the first two may be adopted and used, so long as the presenter is blinded to the process and the process is documented.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1.4. When a blinded presentation is used, the order of presentation shall be recorded afterward, using the number on the card or folder.&nbsp; If an alternative presentation method is used, then the order must also be recorded.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.3.3.1.1.5. In addition to documentation in the incident report(s) and on Eyewitness Identification forms, when it is reasonable, practical and consistent with the best interests of the investigation, presenters should consider audio-recording the presentation. When a decision is made to record, the witness must be informed of the recordation. If the witness does not agree to recordation, the presentation should not be recorded.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.4. Post-Presentation Interview and Documentation:</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.4.1. After the presentation of a photo lineup, the presenter shall avoid any words or actions that might identify the suspect or hinder further investigation.&nbsp; The investigator shall not tell the witness who the suspect is or whether the witness has picked the person whom the investigator believes committed the crime. There will be situations, however, when it is appropriate and necessary within the investigation to identify the suspect to the witness to further the investigation or address public safety needs.&nbsp; If so, then the situation and reasons must be clearly documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.4.2. If the witness picks a photo, the presenter shall ask the witness to describe why the photo was selected. The presenter shall obtain a description of reasons for the witness&rsquo; selection in the witness&rsquo; own words. While it is acceptable for the witness to use a scale (e.g. &ldquo;90% sure,&rdquo; or &ldquo;six out of ten&rdquo;), it is best to avoid scales.&nbsp; The witness&rsquo; responses to questions about their reasons for their selection and their confidence, which is commonly referred to together as a &ldquo;confidence statement,&rdquo; shall be documented on the Eyewitness Identification form (attached) and in the investigator&rsquo;s report. To do this, it is important to ask the witness the questions regarding the &ldquo;suspect description,&rdquo; &ldquo;context,&rdquo; and &ldquo;witness factors&rdquo; found at the end of this document, or their equivalent, and to document the answers. Leading questions are to be avoided.</p>
<p class=""Default"">2.4.3. &nbsp;The presenter shall ask the witness to affirm the confidence statement on the Eyewitness Identification form<em> </em>by reviewing the statement summary and, if accurate, sign the form<em>. </em></p>
<p class=""Default"">3.&nbsp;Show-Ups:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.1. About Show-Ups:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.1.1. Members are to be aware that this section is more restrictive than the law. Show-ups are a valuable tool for quickly identifying or excluding suspects shortly after an incident. Show-ups in general should not be conducted more than one (1) hour after the incident. In rare circumstances it may be necessary to conduct a show-up up to three (3) hours after the incident, but it must be articulated in detail as to why a photo lineup could not be used instead. In all circumstances variables that could impact identification accuracy should be documented, which generally include, but are not limited to: stress, weapon focus, violence, exposure time, and cross-race bias.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.1.2. Show-ups are particularly valuable because they capture the entire head-to-toe appearance of a possible suspect shortly after the incident in question, including features that may not appear in stored photographs such as hair length, style and color, facial hair, tattoos, piercings, clothing, shoes, jewelry, carried items (backpacks, purses, etc.) and state of intoxication.&nbsp; Show-ups can be conducted much more quickly than photo line-ups, and many investigations benefit from the prompt display of a suspect to a witness.&nbsp; Show-ups also result in a shorter retention time for possible suspects than if they were held while a photo lineup is prepared.&nbsp; These reasons, and the fact that they capture the entire, current appearance of the individual, make show-ups an important and valid identification procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2. Conducting Show-Ups:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.1. Obtain a thorough description of the suspect from each witness before the show-up.&nbsp; See Preliminary Checklist &ldquo;information to gather before any identification process.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.2. Ensure that, while making the presentation, all participating officers avoid words or conduct suggesting that the individual presented is criminally liable.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.3. To the extent reasonably possible, avoid tarnishing the suspect by, for example, presenting a suspect in handcuffs or in the back seat of a police car.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.4. Transport the witness to the suspect&rsquo;s location, not the suspect to the witness.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.5. Separate witnesses before, during and, to the extent reasonably possible, after the show-up to avoid communication between them.&nbsp; If witnesses cannot be separated afterward (e.g. they are family members, friends or co-workers), then ask the witnesses not to discuss their identifications with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.6. Read the instructions from the Eyewitness Identification form, ensuring and documenting that the witness understands the instructions.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.7. Document the witness&rsquo;s statement on the Eyewitness Identification form.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8. Document the circumstances of the show-up:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.1. The time of the show up.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.2. The admonishment given before the show-up.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.3. All statements made by the witness during the show-up.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.4. Exactly what the witness said about the identification.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.5. Document what reminded the witness of the suspect; (e.g. the reasons the witness made the identification).</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.6. It is best not to use a scale of 1-10 or a percentage to describe level of certainty, unless the witness must do so; give reasons instead.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.7. Document any conversations witnesses may have had with each other before or during their identification.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.8. Document the lighting at the show up.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.8.9. Note the distance between the witness and the suspect at the show-up.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.9. If a witness identifies the suspect, photograph the clothing and identifying features:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.9.1. Photograph the suspect in the clothing worn upon apprehension including coat, backpack, hat and shoes.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.9.2. If the witness includes these characteristics in the identification, also photo the teeth, hands (including jewelry), birthmarks, scars, tattoos and piercings.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.10.&nbsp; Seize the clothing, shoes, hat, jewelry, etc. if it was involved in the identification.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.10.1. Seize all such clothing incident to arrest or pursuant to a search warrant as evidence of the crime (defendant&rsquo;s identity) as directed by your local prosecuting authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.10.2. Clothing and other apparel may be useful in identifying a suspect.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.10.3. Do not confirm for the witness that the witness identified a person whom the investigator believes committed the crime in question, unless there is a significant reason for doing this, which must be documented.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.11.&nbsp; If the witness identifies the suspect, but does not sign any required forms, note the refusal to sign in an appropriate police report.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.12.&nbsp; If the witness does not identify the suspect, the circumstances and responses shall also be documented on the Eyewitness Identification form and in the report including:</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.12.1. Exactly what the witness said about the identification.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.12.2. Ask the witness how the person differed from the suspect and document the answer.</p>
<p class=""Default"">3.2.12.3. Photograph the individual to document his or her appearance.</p>
<p class=""Default"">4.&nbsp;Witness with Limited or No English Proficiency:</p>
<p class=""Default"">4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a witness to a criminal offense has difficulty communicating (e.g. deaf or hard of hearing, limited English proficiency), then investigators shall arrange for an interpreter before proceeding with any eyewitness identification procedure. Investigators shall document the name of the company and the interpreter providing services in an appropriate police report.</p>
<p class=""Default"">4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the interpreter is permitted to discuss any matter with the witness, the investigating officer shall explain the process that will be used to the interpreter.&nbsp; Once it is clear that the interpreter can communicate effectively with the witness, and that the interpreter understands the process and can explain it to the witness, the eyewitness identification may proceed.</p>
<p class=""Default"">5. Multiple Presentations of the Same Suspect to a Witness:</p>
<p class=""Default"">5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rare for a suspect to be presented for identification more than once in any form to a given witness. There may, however, be valid reasons for multiple presentations of the same suspect to the same witness. For example, when the earlier photo used was outdated and did not accurately represent the suspect&rsquo;s current appearance, it may be appropriate to obtain a more current and accurate photo and present the same suspect in a second identification procedure to the witness. Members should consult with the Detectives Division if the need for multiple presentations occurs and the reason(s) for the subsequent presentation shall be documented.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""Default"">6. Training:</p>
<p class=""Default"">6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; All sworn personnel shall receive training on this Directive and the presentation of lineups and show-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Administrative Removal Warrant:&nbsp; A document, typically signed by a supervisory level Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) administrator and not a judge, that authorizes ICE officers/Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) to arrest non-citizens who are alleged or suspected of having committed immigration violations and/or who are alleged to be deportable.&nbsp; Administrative removal warrants are not required to be supported by probable cause. Administrative removal warrants only allow ICE to detain a named person and do not allow ICE to search a premises.</p>
<p>Consular Immunity: &nbsp;A principle of international law that offers similar protections as diplomatic immunity, but with more limitations, given the functional differences between consular and diplomatic officers.&nbsp; Consular officers are not accorded absolute immunity from a host country&rsquo;s criminal jurisdiction and are immune from local jurisdiction only in cases directly relating to consular functions.</p>
<p>Detainer Request:&nbsp; For the purposes of this directive, Bureau Contact with Members of Immigrant Communities and Individuals with Diplomatic Immunity, a completed Form I-247A submitted by any federal immigration law enforcement branch of ICE to a law enforcement agency that currently has legal and physical custody of an individual suspected of violating federal immigration law.&nbsp; The form asks the law enforcement agency upon which it is served to contact ICE and agree to secure transfer of the person to ICE&rsquo;s custody prior to their release from custody on state or local criminal charges.&nbsp; Form I-247A is only submitted where the law enforcement agency is holding a person on other criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diplomatic Immunity:&nbsp; A principle of international law by which certain foreign government officials are not subject to the jurisdiction of local courts and other authorities for both their official and, to a large extent, their personal activities.&nbsp; In addition to being immune from prosecution, individuals with diplomatic immunity are also exempt from search and seizure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO):&nbsp; The immigration law enforcement branch of ICE, under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).&nbsp; ERO focuses on identifying, detaining and removing individuals who are alleged to be unlawfully present in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign National: A person who was born outside of the jurisdiction of the U.S., who is subject to the laws of a foreign government, and who has not been naturalized under U.S. law (e.g., refugee, green card holder, etc.). This also includes individuals who were born in the U.S., but later renounce their American citizenship.</p>
<p>Honorary Consular Immunity:&nbsp; A principle of international law that offers limited legal protections to honorary consular officers.&nbsp; Honorary consular officers are distinct from career Consular officers in that they may perform consular services on a part-time basis.&nbsp; They retain immunity only for cases relating to consular functions.&nbsp; They are not protected from arrest or search and seizure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homeland Security Investigations (HSI): &nbsp;The investigative branch of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).&nbsp; HSI focuses on combating criminal organizations illegally exploiting America&rsquo;s travel, trade, financial, and immigration systems.&nbsp; HSI is authorized to investigate criminal activities related to human, drug and weapons trafficking; cybercrime; transnational gang activity; human rights violations; and other cross-border criminal activity.</p>
<p>Judicial Warrant: &nbsp;A warrant signed by a federal district court or magistrate judge, or an Oregon state or county judge, that must be executed by law enforcement as a judicial order based on probable cause and full vetting by a neutral judge.&nbsp; These warrants generally allow for a complete search of a premises or parts of a premises, as specifically described in the warrant, and allow for the seizure of either or both persons or evidence, as described in the warrant.</p>
<p>Nonimmigrant Visitor: A foreign-born person, having a permanent residence abroad, who seeks temporary entry into the United States for a specific duration and purpose with the intention to leave the United States upon completion of that purpose and at the end of the specified timeframe.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP):&nbsp; The federal law enforcement agency under DHS responsible for the management of border security, regulation and facilitation of trade and travel, and the enforcement of federal laws governing trade, customs and immigration.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS):&nbsp; The federal government agency, comprised of various departments and sub-agencies, responsible for enforcing and administering customs and immigration laws, managing natural and man-made disaster events, combatting terrorism and other threats to national security, and regulating trade and travel.</p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):&nbsp; The federal law enforcement agency under DHS responsible for the enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this directive is to guide members in their interactions with immigrants and immigrant communities, as well as with those who voluntarily disclose their immigration or diplomatic status. Specifically, this directive establishes limitations into inquiries about immigration status and sets forth acceptable uses of immigration status information volunteered by an individual.&nbsp; Additionally, this policy establishes procedures that direct member actions when managing DHS requests for support, assistance, and information.</p>
<p>2. The Portland Police Bureau is committed to protecting, serving and supporting all residents and community members of the City of Portland, regardless of their actual or perceived national origin or immigration status.&nbsp; Accordingly, no Bureau member shall interrogate, detain, arrest, initiate an investigation or take other official police action against an individual solely on the basis of either of these aspects of their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When necessary, the Bureau partners with DHS to assist in their efforts of managing emergency situations and combatting a wide array of global criminal threats related to drug and human trafficking, terrorism, and human rights violations.&nbsp; Although the Bureau supports the DHS mission as it relates to confronting these security and human rights threats, the Bureau is steadfast in its commitment to contributing to the City&rsquo;s efforts to create a welcoming environment that encourages diversity and inclusivity.</p>
<p>4. To the extent that the mission of DHS, as communicated to the Bureau, is enforcement of immigration laws, the Bureau will follow the direction of the state statutory law and City ordinances by not enforcing or assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, as that is a federal function.&nbsp; Moreover, the Bureau shall not expend personnel, equipment, monetary, or other resources to enforce or assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, unless in a manner that comports with applicable law.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1. Member Contact with Individuals Not Suspected of a Crime.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;Members shall not make inquiries regarding the immigration or citizenship status of an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;If an individual volunteers their immigration status, or if a member inadvertently ascertains an individual&rsquo;s immigration status through another means (e.g., another party volunteers the information), members shall not document immigration status solely or primarily for the purpose of federal immigration law enforcement.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;Members may need to inquire about or document an individual&rsquo;s immigration status where the inquiry relates to a legitimate law enforcement purpose that is unrelated to the enforcement of a federal immigration law, or where required by state or federal law to verify eligibility for a law enforcement cooperation visa or deferred action request.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;A member shall not ask for a victim&rsquo;s immigration status when investigating a crime unless relevant to an element of the crime.&nbsp; If the individual&rsquo;s immigration status is relevant to the investigation (e.g., human trafficking, hate crime, etc.), the member shall explain to the individual why they are documenting the individual&rsquo;s immigration status and its relevance to the investigation.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;An exception to this rule exists if it appears a victim or witness might qualify for a visa or other immigration protections based on cooperation with law enforcement in an investigation of a crime.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;Temporary Immigration Benefits and Protections.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1.&nbsp;In limited circumstances, an individual who is a victim of or witness to specific qualifying crimes and are helpful to the investigation may be eligible for certain immigration benefits or protections, such as law enforcement cooperation visas (i.e., T visa, U visa, or S visa), continued presence status, deferred action status, or other federal resources that provide temporary immigration protections.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.1.&nbsp;Although a member is under no duty to affirmatively request or inquire about an individual&rsquo;s immigration status, if the person requesting temporary immigration benefits or protections volunteers the information, the member is under the same duty to document relevant facts of the case as they would in any police report.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.2.&nbsp;All requests initiated by a victim/witness who is seeking member assistance with enforcement cooperation visas (T visas, U visas, or S visas) shall be submitted to the Chief&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp; The Chief of Police shall designate, in writing, an individual to review and approve or deny these requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.3.&nbsp;Deferred action or continued presence requests initiated by an investigator shall be submitted to the Chief of Police or a designee for approval or denial. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.4.&nbsp;Bureau members authorizing these requests may consult the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office for guidance.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.4.1.4.1.&nbsp;Upon approval, the member-initiated certification paperwork should be submitted to the appropriate federal authority and victim/witness-initiated certification paperwork should be provided to the requester to complete the necessary nonimmigrant visa application.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;If communication appears to be a barrier, the individual has the right to request translation, interpretation, or other communication aids (e.g., sign language interpreter).&nbsp; The Bureau shall provide the appropriate communication aid at no expense to the individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Arrests, Detentions of Immigrants.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;Should members learn about an individual&rsquo;s immigration status either by voluntary statement or other means, members shall not arrest a person for the sole reason that they: 1) are present in the United States illegally; or 2) the subject of an ICE immigration enforcement action of investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;Members shall not assist with the execution of administrative removal warrants issued by CBP, ICE or any other federal agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;Members shall not honor or comply with federal agency immigration detainer requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.4.&nbsp;Members shall not arrest, detain or transport an individual solely on the basis of an immigration detainer or other administrative document issued by ICE.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.4.1.&nbsp;Members shall only carry out an arrest or detention if directed to do so by way of a judicial warrant or order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Scope of Contact and Coordination with DHS.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1.&nbsp;Members shall not assist ICE, CBP or ERO with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.&nbsp;In the event that ICE, CBP or ERO requests the Bureau&rsquo;s assistance for pre-planned missions, only the Chief, or a designee, shall determine if the Bureau will provide assistance.&nbsp; The Chief or designee shall consider the following circumstances, which include but are not limited to if:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.1.&nbsp;There is no other possible resource (e.g., a federal law enforcement agency)that can provide the requested assistance;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.2.&nbsp;The assistance requested is limited to auxiliary tasks not directly related to making arrest or detentions, such as traffic control or providing supplemental security; and&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.3.&nbsp;The Chief or designee determines that there is a threat to the safety of the public or the potential for damage to property if the request for assistance is denied.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.3.&nbsp;In circumstances where the Chief authorizes Bureau assistance for pre-planned missions, members shall only provide the level and type of assistance approved by the Chief or designee to ensure the safety of all involved.&nbsp; Members shall not assist DHS staff with the enforcement of federal immigration laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Domestic Violence:&nbsp; The occurrence of one or more of the following acts between family or household members: 1) attempting to cause or intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causing bodily injury; 2) intentionally, knowingly or recklessly placing another in fear of imminent bodily injury; or 3) causing another to engage in involuntary sexual relations by force or threat of force.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Family or Household Members:&nbsp; Spouses; former spouses; adult persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; persons who are cohabiting or who have cohabited with each other; persons who have been involved in a sexually intimate relationship with each other within two years immediately preceding the filing by one of them of a petition to circuit court for relief; unmarried parents of a child.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Intimate Partner:&nbsp; With respect to a person, the person&rsquo;s spouse or former spouse, a parent of the person&rsquo;s child or another person who has cohabited or is cohabiting with the person in a relationship akin to a spouse.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Menacing:&nbsp; A person who, by word or conduct, intentionally attempts to place another person in fear of imminent serious physical injury.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Petitioner: For the purposes of this directive, a person requesting a protection order within the specified time frame of the order sought, who A) has been abused, stalked, or assaulted by a family or household member, or an intimate partner; B) is at imminent risk of physical injury; or C) reasonably believes that another individual (the potential respondent) is at imminent risk of suicide or causing physical injury to another person.&nbsp; This also may include a law enforcement officer who reasonably believes that another individual is at imminent risk of causing physical injury to themselves or another person.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection Order:&nbsp; Any injunction, restraining order, or any other order issued by a civil or criminal court for the purpose of preventing the following: 1) violent or threatening acts or harassment against another person; 2) sexual violence against another person; or 3) contact or communication with or physical proximity to another person.&nbsp; This includes any temporary or final order issued by a civil or criminal court whether obtained by filing an independent action or as an order put into effect while litigation is pending in another proceeding, so long as any civil or criminal order was issued in response to a complaint, petition, or motion filed by or on behalf of a person seeking protection. &nbsp;This also includes orders for the purpose of preventing suicide when an imminent risk exists.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1. This policy establishes procedures for the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s enforcement of protection orders and its response to domestic violence (DV) incidents.&nbsp; DV incidents have specific legal requirements (e.g., mandatory arrest); therefore, the directive includes more comprehensive guidance for those cases.</p>
<p>2. The Bureau is committed to protecting and working to reduce ongoing risks to the safety of survivors of DV by thoroughly investigating DV incidents and connecting survivors to resources.&nbsp; Furthermore, in addition to complying with the Oregon law requiring the mandatory arrest of DV suspects, Bureau members shall give full faith and credit to valid protection orders issued by all other jurisdictions and arrest and take into custody suspects in domestic disputes and individuals who have violated a protection order, in an effort to prevent further injury or abuse.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong>Procedure:</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Protection Orders.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State and federal law allow for the use of protection orders as a civil means by which an individual can seek protection from a person who has abused, stalked, assaulted, caused or attempted to cause physical injury to the individual, or who has put the individual in imminent risk of physical injury. &nbsp;Petitioners for protection orders do not need an attorney to file the order. &nbsp;There is no cost to the petitioner for obtaining a protection order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should consult the relevant Oregon Revised Statute or contact the City Attorney&rsquo;s Office for specific eligibility, issuance, proof of service, and enforcement requirements by protection order type, as needed.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuance.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A petitioner cannot serve their own protection order. &nbsp;A protection order can only be served by:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sheriff&rsquo;s &nbsp;deputy,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A police officer,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A private process server or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Oregon resident 18 years of age or older.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a member serves a copy of the protection order to the respondent, the member shall also include the following documents, when applicable:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firearms Surrender and Return Terms For Respondents Under Restraining Orders Form;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently Asked Questions: Surrender and Return of Firearms in Multnomah County, Family Abuse Prevention Act Restraining Order Cases; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.3.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A firearms affidavit.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In situations where a protection order has not yet been served and both the petitioner and respondent are present, members on the scene shall assist by personally serving the order or ensuring the order is served by a third party, if this is allowable by state law and can be accomplished in a timely manner. &nbsp;The petitioner copy may be served upon the respondent if the respondent copy is unavailable. &nbsp;Should the respondent refuse to comply with the protection order before the order can be entered into the Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS), the order can be enforced to protect the petitioner.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Proof of Service.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a member serves the protection order, the member shall deliver a true copy of the affidavit of proof of service and, when applicable, the documents referenced in Sub-sections 1.3.2.1.-1.3.2.3. of this directive.&nbsp; The member shall also:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete Notification of Service form (available at all precincts), then call Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office (MCSO) Records Division to confirm that the protection order has been served and indicate whether they will fax or hand-deliver the Notification of Service form. &nbsp;The current phone number is in the Problem Solving Resource Guide.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.4.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall fax or deliver the completed form prior to the end of their shift.&nbsp; If submitting by fax, the member shall send the original form via interoffice mail to Family Court/BLDG 101/Rm 211.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.4.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall include the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) number on the form, if available, and note in the CAD the date, time, location, name of the person(s) served and the protection order number.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete a General Offense (GO) Report documenting the service.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Violation and Enforcement of Protection Orders.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall search the LEDS and National Crime Information Center (NCIC) to authenticate protection orders.&nbsp; A protection order does not need to be registered in LEDS or NCIC to be deemed valid or enforceable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a petitioner provides a copy of the protection order that does not appear in LEDS or NCIC, members shall make a good faith effort to verify the copy is a true copy and the respondent has been served with that order or appeared in person before the court, therefore waiving the proof of service requirement.&nbsp; The member shall consider the copy to be valid if the order:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.5.1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Includes the names of the petitioner and respondent;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.5.1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appears to be in effect (i.e., includes an issuance date);</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.5.1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indicates issuance by a judicial official; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.5.1.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identifies the conditions of relief awarded by the judicial official.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall enforce a protection order whether or not the victim or presumptive petitioner has a copy of the order, if the member is able to verify the existence of the order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall enforce protection order violations for orders issued by another state, U.S. territory or by a federally-recognized tribe.&nbsp; Those protection orders are entitled to full enforcement of the order for violations occurring within this jurisdiction, as if it were a valid Oregon order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.5.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall arrest the respondent if probable cause is established. &nbsp;If available, the member shall obtain a copy of the original copy of the protection order to include in their reporting.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.5.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Multnomah County District Attorney&rsquo;s Office (DA) shall review the member&rsquo;s report for prosecution or referral to the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because protection orders contain different prohibitions for each respondent, members shall utilize eCourt to view the complete order or call the issuing jurisdiction to confirm what actions and/or contacts the respondent is prohibited from committing.&nbsp; If this is not possible, members shall make a good faith effort to enforce the order.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the respondent is restrained by the order. &nbsp;A petitioner may initiate contact with the respondent; however, should the respondent have contact with the petitioner, the respondent, not the petitioner, may be in violation of the order and subject to arrest.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the respondent intentionally engaged in conduct prohibited by the order while the order was in effect; thereby, recklessly creating a substantial risk of physical injury to a person protected by the order, or intentionally attempting to place the petitioner in fear of imminent physical injury, they shall be subject to arrest.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection orders can prohibit the respondent from possessing or carrying a firearm(s) or ammunition.&nbsp; Respondents are in violation of the protection order if they possess or carry a firearm or ammunition, even if the petitioner or anyone named in the order is not present or involved in an incident with the respondent.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent or a petitioner may request that a member take control of the respondent&rsquo;s firearm(s), pursuant to the protection order. &nbsp;If a member receives this request and there has not been a violation of the protection order as of that time, the member may take any firearms for safekeeping. &nbsp;Members shall document on the Property Evidence Receipt, the relevant protection order number and whether the owner/respondent is prohibited from possessing or carrying the weapon(s), pursuant to a protection order that is in effect. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If firearm possession is part of a violation of the protection order, safekeeping no longer applies, and members shall take the weapon(s) as evidence.&nbsp; Members shall document the relevant protection order number on the Property Evidence Receipt.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.5.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall not issue citations in lieu of custody for violation of a protection order.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Domestic Disputes.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All domestic dispute calls require at least a two-Bureau member response. &nbsp;Members shall not be allowed to cancel cover.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall make every effort to determine the identity of the primary or potential suspect by considering the following factors, which include but are not limited to:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The comparative injuries inflicted or the severity of the threats that created a fear of physical injury;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If reasonably ascertainable (e.g., acquiring background information from another jurisdiction, incident witnesses or available databases), the history of DV between the persons;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether any alleged crime was committed in self-defense; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential for future assaults.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall arrest and take into custody an offender if the dispute involves family or household members and the responding members have probable cause to believe one of the persons has:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assaulted the other person; or</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committed the crime of strangulation or menacing.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It is the responsibility of mental health facilities to have the proper resources to manage people in mental health crisis and to transport persons under their supervision to other care facilities. &nbsp;Mental health facilities should direct routine and urgent calls to their facility administrator or the Multnomah County Crisis Line. &nbsp;It is the expectation that mental health facilities will not request police assistance with behavior management, such as gaining physical control of a person who is aggressive, resistive, or refuses to go with facility-arranged transportation. &nbsp;Members should not become involved in these behavior management matters. &nbsp;Members shall respond to: 1) assaults in progress and/or other serious events in which immediate intervention is required to stop or mitigate injury to a person; 2) investigate crimes and take action as appropriate; and 3) requests for mental health custody in accordance with Directive 850.22, Police Response to Mental Health Directors Holds and Elopement. Members shall treat these individuals with dignity and compassion at all times.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Member-Supervisor Coordinated Response Required:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Response to emergencies (Priority 1-3) at designated secure residential mental health treatment facilities shall include a supervisor and a minimum of four (4) officers, one of which is an Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team (ECIT) Officer, if available. &nbsp;ECIT officers shall advise Sergeants on the mental health aspects of the call, when feasible. &nbsp;Unless extreme exigent circumstances exist, members may not enter a designated secure mental health facility without notifying their supervisor of the request and coordinating a response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lower priority calls at designated secure residential mental health treatment facilities shall be dispatched to the district officer and require supervisor notification. &nbsp;A supervisor may request assistance of an ECIT officer if necessary.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Response to emergencies (Priority 1-3) at designated non-secure residential mental health treatment facilities shall include a supervisor and a minimum of two (2) officers, one of which is an ECIT officer, if available. &nbsp;ECIT officers shall advise Sergeants on the mental health aspects of the call when feasible. &nbsp;Unless extreme exigent circumstances exist, members may not enter a non-secure mental health facility or residential mental health facility without notifying their supervisor of the request and coordinating a response.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to ROADMAP, as listed in Directive 850.20, Police Response to Mental Health Crisis, the following are other tactical options for members and their supervisors to consider before entry into a designated residential mental health facility:<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the nature of the situation and necessity for police intervention.<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When time allows, have responding members stage and wait for the arrival of all necessary personnel and resources.<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request a staff member meet police outside the facility to provide information on: 1) the facility layout; 2) the locations of the person who requires police response, other patients, visitors, and staff; and 3) any other information about the incident and persons involved that would aid police in planning their response.<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If police intervention is warranted, evaluate contact options, including by phone, in person, or other means. &nbsp;If in person, evaluate the need to utilize additional cover members. &nbsp;Develop a tactical plan, taking advantage of the most effective control options that may safely resolve the incident.<strong></strong></p>
<p>2. Behavioral Health Unit (BHU) Responsibilities:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Behavioral Health Unit shall:<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post designated secure residential mental health treatment facility floor plans on the Bureau&rsquo;s Intranet.<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regularly review the designated Multnomah County and/or State of Oregon mental health facility lists to ensure the accuracy of mental health facility hazard flags.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. In the context of mental health services, mental health providers, not law enforcement, are responsible for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of persons who are in mental health crisis. &nbsp;There are times, however, when mental health providers need police services.</p>
<p>2. Because mental health custody as initiated by mental health providers may be civil which can include Director&rsquo;s Custody, Order of Civil Commitment, Psychiatric Security Review Board (PSRB) Commitment Orders, Revocation Orders in legal/commitment status, members shall be guided by law when responding to mental health provider service requests.</p>
<p>3. A member&rsquo;s ability to manage a person in custody in a safe, constructive, and humane manner is of critical importance to the involved person, the involved person&rsquo;s support system, community members, mental health providers, and the Police Bureau. &nbsp;Members shall treat the individual with dignity and compassion at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Police Response to Civil Custody Requests:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Community Mental Health Program Director's Custody:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall take a person into custody when the Community Mental Health Program Director, or designee, notifies the member that the Director has probable cause to believe that the person is dangerous to self or to any other person.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When assisting a community mental health program director or designee as defined in ORS &sect; 426.005 (1) (a) with taking a person into custody (Director's Custody), members shall:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.2.1. Determine if taking civil custody of the person named on the Director's Custody Report may be achieved in a safe manner. &nbsp;Delaying custody is a tactic that may be used if the member determines that taking the person into custody under present circumstances may result in an undue safety risk to members, the involved person, and/or others. &nbsp;If delaying custody, members shall notify a supervisor and then develop a plan to determine a safer time and method to take the person into civil custody. &nbsp;An appropriate police report shall be completed documenting the details of this decision.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.2.2. If a member takes a person into custody, the member shall arrange for AMR transport to the secure evaluation facility, unless extraordinary circumstances warrant police transport.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.1.2.3. When necessary, members shall complete an appropriate police report and mental health mask documenting the civil custody or Director&rsquo;s Hold.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlawful Elopement from a Mental Health Facility or Hospital:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person is on commitment status (e.g., Order of Commitment) and elopes without permission from a facility, they have unlawfully eloped and members may be contacted to bring that person back to the facility.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the above circumstances, members shall:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.3.1. Verify that the NMI or Order of Commitment exists. &nbsp;The facility should have a copy of the Order on location; otherwise, members may verify the NMI or Order with the Multnomah County Crisis Line.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.2.3.1.1. Criteria for court-ordered civil commitments are dictated by individual state laws. &nbsp;If a patient has eloped from a mental health facility in another state, members shall assess the person and take action in accordance with Directive 850.20, Police Response to Mental Health Crisis and/or Directive 850.21, Peace Officer Custody (Civil). &nbsp;Members shall contact the reporting facility and notify them of the disposition.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.3.2. Determine if taking civil custody of the person named on the Order of Commitment may be achieved in a safe manner. &nbsp;Delaying custody is a tactic that may be used if the member determines that taking the person into custody under present circumstances may result in an undue safety risk to members, the involved person, and/or others. &nbsp;If delaying custody, members shall notify a supervisor and then develop a plan to determine a safer time and method to take the person into civil custody.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.3.3. Transport the named person back to the facility unless the member determines the person meets the criteria in Directive 850.21, Peace Officer Custody (Civil).</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Elopement from a Mental Health Facility:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person is not on commitment status (e.g., Order of Commitment) and elopes without permission from a facility, that person is free to leave.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a person wishes to voluntarily return to the facility, members may transport that person to the facility.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should members receive a call alleging the eloped person is deemed to be dangerous to self or others, members must assess the person in accordance with Directive 850.20, Police Response to Mental Health Crisis and/or Directive 850.21, Peace Officer Custody (Civil).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Member-Supervisor Coordinated Response Required:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warrants of Detention/Trial Visitation: During pre-trial civil commitment processes, a person with an alleged mental illness may be released into the community and be monitored by a civil commitment investigator. A civil warrant of detention may also be issued by a judge to take a person with mental illness into custody. &nbsp;&nbsp;Because the statutory authority to serve a warrant of detention rests with the Multnomah County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office, members shall not become involved in these activities unless called to an incident to assist a civil commitment investigator or civil deputy in fulfilling the investigator&rsquo;s or deputy&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">2.2.1.2. Determine if taking custody of the person named on the PSRB Order may be achieved in a safe manner. &nbsp;Delaying custody is a tactic that may be used if the member determines that taking the person into custody under present circumstances may result in an undue safety risk to members, the involved person, and/or others. &nbsp;If delaying custody, members shall notify a supervisor and then develop a plan to determine a safer time and method to take the person into custody.</p>

<li>Mental Health Crisis: An incident in which someone with an actual or perceived mental illness experiences intense feelings of personal distress (e.g. anxiety, depression, anger, fear, panic, hopelessness), a thought disorder (e.g. visual or auditory&nbsp; hallucinations, delusions, sensory impairment or cognitive impairment), obvious changes in functioning (e.g. neglect of personal hygiene) and/or catastrophic life events (e.g. disruptions in personal relationships, support systems or living arrangements; loss of autonomy or parental rights; victimization or natural disasters), which may, but not necessarily, result in an upward trajectory of intensity culminating in thoughts or acts that are dangerous to self and/or others.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. In the context of mental health crisis, the Portland Police Bureau recognizes the importance of civil rights and the need for individuals to have control over their person. However, the Police Bureau also recognizes there are times when, as a result of mental health crisis, a person may lack the capacity to make sound judgments about their personal situation.&nbsp; After considering the alternatives outlined in 850.20, and after finding probable cause exists for a hold, members may take the individual into custody on a Peace Officer Hold.&nbsp; Members shall treat the individual with dignity and compassion at all times.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Members shall be guided by law regarding civil custody of persons in mental health crisis with the goal of assessing the need for custody. If the need arises, the act of custody shall be resolved in as safe, constructive, and humane of a manner as possible.</p>
<p>3. A member&rsquo;s ability to manage custody by this expectation is of critical importance to the involved person, the involved person&rsquo;s support system, community members, mental health providers, and the Police Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Peace Officer Custody:</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may take a person into peace officer custody if the member has probable cause to believe the person is dangerous to self or to any other person and is in need of immediate care, custody or treatment for mental illness.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before taking a person into peace officer custody for a mental health evaluation, members shall:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Develop and communicate a tactical plan to participating members, so as to take advantage of the most effective options that may safely resolve the incident. Tactics members should consider in devising a tactical plan include, but are not limited to, the following (&ldquo;ROADMAP&rdquo; is a mnemonic device that assists members in remembering tactics taught in training):</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>R &ndash;</strong> Request specialized units,</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.2.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the need for assistance from individuals with additional training in working with mental health crisis situations (e.g. Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team (ECIT) members, Project Respond, Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT)). When needed, assistance may be requested through the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.2.1.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the need for possible consultation with a mental health provider (Refer to the Behavioral Health Unit&rsquo;s Community Mental Health Resources Guide), and/or anyone else the member deems appropriate.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">1.2.1.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disengagement is a tactic to be considered to reduce undue safety risk to the member, the involved persons, or others. Members will consult with a supervisor to determine whether to make contact at a different time or under different circumstances. The tactic requires members to complete a general offense report and notify the Multnomah County Call Center of the situation (e.g. name, date of birth, disposition).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.2.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>M </strong>&ndash; More Resources/Summon Reinforcements,</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transport or facilitate the transport of the individual to the appropriate secure evaluation facility or nearest designated hospital emergency department that conducts mental health evaluations.<em> </em>Refer to Directives 630.45 Emergency Medical Custody Transports and 630.50 Emergency Medical Aid for additional information.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Juveniles may be taken into civil custody for a mental health evaluation under the same legal standard as adults. Members will notify the juvenile's legal guardian or the Department of Human Services prior to transport to a secure evaluation facility or nearest designated hospital emergency department that conducts mental health evaluations.</p>
<p>2. Member Responsibilities:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a member takes a person into custody under the member&rsquo;s peace officer authority, the member will complete a Report of Peace Officer Custody of an Allegedly Mentally Ill Person (this is Form MHD [ORS &sect; 426.228] of the Mental Health Division of the Oregon Health Authority).&nbsp; Members shall provide the report to AMR or, in those extraordinary circumstances when the officer provides transport, the treating physician at the hospital or Unity Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a member takes a person into custody under the direction of the Community Mental Health Program Director or designee, the member shall provide the custody report of the Community Mental Health Program Director or designee to AMR or, in those extraordinary circumstances when the officer provides transport, the treating physician at the hospital or Unity Center.</p>

<p><strong>About Mental Health:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Mental health is a state of successful performance of mental function, resulting in productive activities, fulfilling relationships with other people, and the ability to adapt to change and to cope with adversity. Mental health is indispensable to personal well-being, family and interpersonal relationships, and contribution to community or society.</p>
<p>2. Mental illnesses are health conditions that are characterized by alternations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Alternations in thinking, mood, or behavior contribute to a host of problems-patient distress, impaired functioning, or heightened risk of death, pain, disability, or loss of freedom.</p>
<p>3. Mental health problems refer to signs and symptoms of insufficient intensity or duration to meet the criteria for a mental illness diagnosis. Almost everyone has experienced mental health problems in which the distress one feels matches some of the signs and symptoms of mental illness. Mental health problems may warrant active efforts in health promotion, prevention, and treatment. Mental health problems may escalate to the level of mental health crisis if the situation and person&rsquo;s level of distress exceeds his or her abilities to cope.</p>
<p>4. Mental illness is distinct from an intoxicant or a substance-induced condition.</p>
<p>5. Mental illness is distinct from intellectual or developmental disabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Policy:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. In the context of mental health services, mental health providers are responsible for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of persons with mental illnesses and assessment and intervention with those who are in mental health crisis. However, the Portland Police Bureau recognizes that its members are often first responders to individuals with mental illness who present in crisis or with immediate needs. The Portland Police Bureau is committed to serving individuals in mental health crisis in partnership with mental health providers, the justice system, emergency medical services, and community members. When appropriate, referral to community-based treatment services is a preferred alternative to arrest and incarceration of persons who are in mental health crisis.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that members will have contact with&nbsp;residents who&nbsp;experience mental illness but are not in crisis.&nbsp; Many members of the Portland Police Bureau will come to be familiar with individuals in the community who members know to have a mental illness.&nbsp; The Police Bureau&nbsp;provides training so&nbsp;that members may recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness in the absence of crisis, and expects members to engage these&nbsp;individuals with dignity and respect, using the skills they have learned in their crisis training.&nbsp;It is the Police Bureau's intention&nbsp;that members&nbsp;give special consideration to these situations,&nbsp;recognizing&nbsp;that&nbsp;using crisis intervention skills&nbsp;with all individuals experiencing mental illness&nbsp;will&nbsp;support&nbsp;the Bureau's goal of safely resolving situations, providing excellent service&nbsp;and building respectful relationships with&nbsp;mental health peers, family&nbsp;members, providers and other involved City of Portland residents.</p>
<p><em>3.&nbsp;</em>Members are increasingly required to respond to and intervene on behalf of persons who are in mental health crisis. While members are not expected to make mental health diagnoses, they are expected to recognize signs and symptoms that may suggest a mental illness as well as behaviors that are indicative of mental health crisis. The goal is to use de-escalation skills to maximize the likelihood of a safe outcome for members, individuals, and the community.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Member Expectation and Training:</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When members recognize that a person whom they are contacting has signs and symptoms indicative of a mental illness, members are expected to use their training to attempt engagement without escalating the situation.&nbsp; When responding to incidents involving persons who are experiencing a mental health crisis, members are also expected to manage the scene and develop a reasonable disposition plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All members on a call shall answer the mental health indicator question. &nbsp;Members shall document the incident on an appropriate police report, complete all reporting requirements for a mental health crisis response, and submit the information to a supervisor before the end of shift.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mental Health Response Training:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All new sworn members will receive Mental Health Response training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All existing sworn members will receive Mental Health Response refresher training during annual, in-service training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bureau provides training so that members may recognize signs and symptoms of mental illness and develop skills to engage individuals experiencing mental illness with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>2. Responding to and managing scenes involving persons in mental health crisis:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When responding to incidents involving persons displaying behavior indicative of mental health crisis members will consider the following actions to manage the incident for the safety of all at the scene:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the nature of the incident and necessity for police intervention when feasible, based on information known to the member at the time (e.g. reports, known history, observed behavior, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the member decides to intervene, consider, when feasible, the use of verbal and non-verbal communication skills to engage a person who may be agitated, upset or at risk of becoming emotionally unstable in order to calmly and safely resolve the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tactics members should consider in devising a response plan include, but are not limited to, the following (&ldquo;ROADMAP&rdquo; is a mnemonic device that assists members in remembering tactics taught in training):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>R &ndash;</strong> Request specialized units,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the need for assistance from individuals with additional training in working with mental health crisis situations (e.g. Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team (ECIT) members, Project Respond, Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT)). When a member determines that ECIT assistance is needed, they shall make the request through the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluate the need for possible consultation with a mental health provider (e.g. see the Behavioral Health Unit&rsquo;s Community Mental Health Resources such as the Multnomah County Call Center, the involved person&rsquo;s mental health providers), and/or anyone else the member deems appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>O -</strong> Observe or use Surveillance to monitor subject or situation,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A &ndash;</strong> Area Containment (perimeter, containment),</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>D &ndash;</strong> Disengage with a plan to resolve later,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disengagement is a tactic to be considered to reduce undue safety risk to the member, the involved persons, or others. Prior to disengagement, members will make reasonable efforts to gather relevant information about the person in crisis from readily available sources, such as the Multnomah County Call Center, and consult with a supervisor to determine whether to make contact at a different time or under different circumstances. The tactic requires members to complete a general offense report, notify the Multnomah County Call Center of the situation (e.g. name, date of birth, disposition), and develop a plan in accordance with Bureau training. Members shall not disengage where an individual presents an immediate danger to a third party.&nbsp; Where an individual presents an immediate danger to her/himself, prior to disengagement members shall assess whether they could reasonably remain at the scene and use other tactics to diminish the risk of harm to the individual without increasing the risk of harm to the member or third parties.&nbsp; A perception of risk based on mere suspicion will not constitute &lsquo;immediate danger.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>M </strong>&ndash; More Resources/Summon Reinforcements,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A &ndash;</strong> Arrest Delayed (get a warrant, or try different time/place),</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>P &ndash;</strong> Patience.&nbsp; Use time and communication to attempt to de-escalate the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If custody is necessary, develop and communicate a tactical plan to participating members, so as to take advantage of the most effective options that may safely resolve the incident.</p>
<p>3. Disposition:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In determining a non-criminal resolution for a person with a mental illness or in mental health crisis, members will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the behavior of the person and the governmental interests at stake. Following is a list of non-criminal dispositions that may be appropriate at the scene, among others:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer the involved person to a mental health provider; see the Behavioral Health Unit&rsquo;s Community Mental Health Resources, for referral information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request AMR transport for the involved person to a mental health or medical facility for voluntary care. &nbsp;Members should inform AMR personnel of the situation so AMR can pass the information along to staff at the facility upon arrival.&nbsp; Members may meet up with AMR at the facility and may escort the person into the waiting area, introduce them to facility staff, and share with staff a brief verbal report on the facts of the case. Members are not required to standby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take the involved person into custody and arrange for AMR transport to a medical facility in accordance with Directive 850.21, Peace Officer Custody (Civil), or Directive 850.22, Police Response to Mental Health Directors Holds and Elopement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of which disposition above is used, members are required to complete an appropriate police report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If an individual is taken into custody, either civilly or criminally, members are required to document consideration and/or use of ROADMAP tactics.</p>
<p>4. Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team (ECIT) Member Responsibilities:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECIT members may also volunteer to become the primary member on any call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECIT officers may serve as a resource to the Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT). Additionally, ECIT officers may facilitate an efficient transition when CNT arrives on scene. However, ECIT will not be used in place of CNT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECIT members will notify his/her supervisor when leaving their assigned precinct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ECIT members who participate in a mental health crisis call by using their crisis intervention skills shall complete any required report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors will manage the dispatch and use of ECIT members and coordinate with the Bureau of Emergency Communications (BOEC) as appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors will acknowledge or respond to all calls where a member is dispatched to a designated mental health facility, in accordance with Directive, 850.25, Police Response to Mental Health Facilities.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. The purpose of this directive is to establish rules and guidelines for Portland Police Bureau members when traveling while armed or in an official capacity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. It is the Portland Police Bureau&rsquo;s expectation that any member who conducts official business at the Portland International Airport (PDX) or any stateside airport comply with Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations and adhere to policies and practices established by personnel, airport police, and airline officials.&nbsp; Security regulations at airports are strictly enforced and members are not exempt from following them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>1. Conducting Official Business at PDX.</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sworn members should notify the Port of Portland (Port) Police in advance of pending trips to the airport for official business, when feasible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; On-duty sworn members, uniformed and in plainclothes assignments, who have official business at the airport, may move freely about the area outside the gate security checkpoints (GSC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sworn members conducting official business beyond GSC shall:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coordinate as far in advance as practicable with Port Police.&nbsp; This official business may include, but is not limited to: surveillance of passengers; escorting passengers; meeting incoming passengers; conducting interviews of persons with everyday access beyond the GSC; and other police functions within the scope of their employment by the Bureau as required.&nbsp; Members must conform to the same TSA requirements imposed on Port Police for pre-planned operations and business matters.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be escorted by Port Police. &nbsp;Members working with Port Police on pre-planned operations will abide by PDX security requirements. If the pre-planned operation is a clandestine surveillance operation, members will work within the Port Police and TSA requirements to allow for area observation, which should be managed or coordinated through uniformed Port Police officers.</p>
<p>1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sworn members issued PDX Security Badges (Black Star) shall conduct their business in accordance with PDX security policies regarding armed law enforcement in secure areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Emergency Situations.</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members engaged in immediate police action under emergency circumstances (such as hot pursuit or emergency cover of other officers to include Port Police) will coordinate all actions on airport grounds through the Port of Portland dispatch and Port Police.&nbsp; The physical barriers and GSC should preclude any suspect(s) and member(s) from accessing areas of the terminal beyond the GSC.&nbsp; All breaches of secured areas on airport property require the intervention of the Port Police.&nbsp; Members shall cooperate with Port Police when they arrive.</p>
<p>3. Traveling on Official Business.</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Authorized sworn members have occasion to travel on official business. &nbsp;Members must abide by TSA regulations for law enforcement officers traveling while armed.&nbsp; Prior to traveling while armed, members will contact the Training Division to complete the TSA&rsquo;s Law Enforcement Officer&rsquo;s Flying Armed training class.&nbsp; Permissible reasons for traveling armed are listed on the TSA.gov website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members must have the following documentation when flying on official business while armed:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will obtain a National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) number, via WebLEDS with command approval (Lt. or above), and submit to TSA at least 24 hours prior to travel.&nbsp; A copy of this NLETS number and teletype is simultaneously sent to the originating airport on the member&rsquo;s day of travel; however, members must have either an electronic copy or the paper print out of the teletype sent by the Federal Air Marshal Service to present to TSA to enter areas beyond the GSC. &nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members having an authorized change in their travel itinerary will contact PPB Records teletype desk, by phone, to obtain an NLETS number authorizing travel on the re-scheduled flight prior to checking in for that flight. &nbsp;Members will request that a copy of the teletype containing the NLETS number be forwarded to their email.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will present their State issued driver&rsquo;s license and Bureau issued identification when requested by airline and TSA personnel.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will complete a Notice to Armed Individuals form per airline standard affirming that they have completed the appropriate training to travel armed.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the member&rsquo;s itinerary requires more than one Notice to Armed Individuals form, per travel day, the member will complete the additional forms prior to departure.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will present their boarding pass, when requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will notify their chain of command if any problems prevent them from proceeding past a GSC or traveling on their scheduled flight.</p>
<p>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will travel in appropriate civilian attire and shall conceal their weapon from public view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Process Through GSCs While Armed.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will not attempt to access the area beyond the GSC through the normal screening lanes when traveling armed, as this can cause a shutdown of all airport gate screening and airport flight operations.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At PDX, members will proceed to their gate via the terminal exit adjacent to the GSC and will have their badges visibly displayed for TSA personnel to see. &nbsp;Members will check-in with TSA by completing the required entry in the TSA log and presenting identification listed in Section 3.2.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members returning to PDX from other stateside airports may encounter different procedures; members should contact airport police or TSA personnel for assistance or escort beyond GSCs if they are unsure of airport protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boarding.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should arrive to their gate earlier than the listed boarding time and check-in with gate agents.&nbsp; Members will present their identification, a completed Notice to Armed Individuals form, and boarding pass and remain available for pre-board with flight personnel, if authorized by gate agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.6.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should be aware that airlines are not required to allow members to board a flight if they are armed.&nbsp; Members encountering any administrative or procedural problems will follow all instructions given by TSA, Air Marshal(s) and airline personnel, and not assert law enforcement authority.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.6.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should be aware that many cockpit crew members are now authorized to carry firearms and will advise the Bureau member if they are armed. &nbsp;Members should also be aware that other armed law enforcement officers (LEOs) may be present on the same flight and that their identity will be shared among other armed personnel by flight crew members.&nbsp; Members should avoid publicly initiating contact with Air Marshals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Flight.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall carry their weapon(s) throughout the flight; no weapons shall be placed in the overhead bins.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members shall not consume alcohol while traveling armed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prisoner Transport.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will provide TSA and airline personnel documentation authorizing the transportation of a prisoner when requested.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The decision to allow a member to board a flight with a prisoner resides with the crew pilots; members should be aware that they may not be allowed to board.&nbsp; Members encountering problems will follow instructions given by TSA, Air Marshal(s), and airline personnel, and will not assert law enforcement authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Non-Official Business.</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Off-duty members are subject to the same regulations as the general public in regard to firearm(s) and ammunition while at the airport. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members traveling with firearms and/or ammunition will comply with the guidelines located on the TSA.gov website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Non-Commercial/Private Aircraft Companies Located at Airports.</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-commercial companies (e.g., Flightcraft, UPS) conduct operations on airport property but away from the main terminal. Although they are governed by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations, they control their own security.&nbsp; Members soliciting entry to these areas or who have questions should contact the company directly.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Directive 1500.00, Training</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ballistic Shield: A portable device capable of at least National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Level IIIA ballistic protection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shield Element: The formation of members configured to safely deploy the ballistic shield. The number of members in the shield element will be based on the mission to be accomplished through the use of the shield.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy: &nbsp; </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A ballistic shield is a defensive tool designed to provide Police Bureau members with protection during custody incidents, rescue efforts, searching, or when rendering aid.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Issuance and Inspection:</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Police Bureau will issue ballistic shields to Responsibility Units for specific tactical purposes. Responsibility Unit Managers shall ensure the availability, security, inspection, and maintenance of ballistic shields assigned to their respective Responsibility Unit in accordance with Directive 1200.00, Inspections, Maintenance, Responsibility and Authority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Modifications:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only manufacture-specific accessories may be added to a ballistic shield after permission to modify has been granted by the Training Division Manager, or designee, in writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Training:</p>
<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ongoing training regarding ballistic shields will be coordinated by the Training Division, in accordance with Directive 1500.00, Training.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Carrying Requirements:</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ballistic shields will be stored within supervisor vehicles for deployment upon a member&rsquo;s request or a supervisor&rsquo;s order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Use:</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballistic shield is not a tactic, but a piece of equipment that may be used to support and enhance trained patrol tactics. Prior to deploying a ballistic shield, members should consider the following factors:</p>
<p>5.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Threat Assessment: Information about the subject&rsquo;s capabilities includes, but is not limited to access to weapons, type and capability of weapons, subject&rsquo;s prior actions, and subject&rsquo;s ongoing behavior.</p>
<p>5.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Environment: The physical and operational environment affecting the approach and custody including, but not limited to obstacles, available cover, and potential secondary threats.</p>
<p>5.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time, tactics, and resources: The capabilities of police and needs in composing a team includes, but is not limited to specific equipment (e.g. electronic control weapon, less lethal weapons, canines), members to cover threats, Special Emergency Reaction Team (SERT) consultation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballistic shield is to be used (e.g. with shield element) to provide additional ballistic protection for approaching a downed, potentially armed subject; for the rescue of a downed individual (e.g. member, victim, witness, etc.), or for clearing of large outdoor open areas, or for the clearing of vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ballistic shield may also be used to provide a fixed defensive position for members to use as cover. These situations may include the use of the ballistic shield over a car door or on a stationary perimeter position or to provide protection for members covering hallways or large open areas within a structure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absent exigent circumstances, the ballistic shield will not be used for the searching of structures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Supervisor Responsibilities:</p>
<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors will ensure the ballistic shield is properly assembled or otherwise ready for deployment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors will ensure deployment of the ballistic shield is appropriate or if alternative options exist up to and including Special Emergency Reaction Team (SERT) consultation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supervisors who utilize a ballistic shield or shield element formation must notify the Training Division of deployment; appropriate details may be relayed via email. &nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deadly Force, also known as Lethal Force: &nbsp;Any use of force likely to cause death or serious physical injury, including the use of a firearm, carotid neck hold, or strike to the head, neck or throat with a hard object.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Objectively Reasonable: &nbsp;The reasonableness of a use of force is based on the totality of circumstances known by an officer at the time of action or decision-making. &nbsp;It shall be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, without the clarity of 20/20 hindsight after the event has concluded. &nbsp;The measure of reasonableness gives consideration to the reality that officers are often forced to make split-second decisions in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving. &nbsp;In the application or evaluation of the use of force, the uses of the terms reasonable and reasonably in this policy refer to objective reasonableness.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Policy:</p>
<p>1. This policy establishes the specific guidelines and reporting requirements for the reporting and investigation of incidents involving uses of deadly force, death as a result of member use of force, and in-custody deaths.</p>
<p>2. The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that a member&rsquo;s use of deadly force or the death of an individual while in police custody requires impartial and timely review. &nbsp;It is the policy of the Bureau that uses of deadly force, death as a result of member use of force, and in-custody deaths, whether on or off duty, be investigated with the utmost thoroughness, professionalism and impartiality so as to determine whether member actions comport with applicable law and Bureau policies and training.</p>
<p>3. The Bureau acknowledges that the investigations of these incidents are of critical importance to the involved member, the Bureau, and the community.&nbsp; The Bureau entrusts the Detective&nbsp;Division with the responsibility to conduct the criminal investigation of the incident objectively and thoroughly. &nbsp;Concurrently, the Professional Standards Division (PSD) shall also conduct an administrative review of each such incident. &nbsp;The Detective Division may provide information and/or findings from the criminal investigation to PSD; however, all personnel involved in the administrative review shall keep information garnered from the PSD investigation of the involved member(s) strictly confidential, not permitting disclosure of any such information or its fruits to the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Bureau members will be afforded all rights guaranteed under the United States and State of Oregon Constitutions and the benefits of the current collective bargaining agreement throughout the investigation.</p>
<p>5. To ensure public accountability, the Bureau is committed to establishing open communication and transparent practices with the public in an effort to cultivate and build community trust; however, information that could jeopardize the integrity of any investigation or any pending prosecution may be withheld from release until it is appropriate or a court of competent jurisdiction directs release.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;The Bureau understands the impact that these traumatic incidents have on members and acknowledges the need to be sensitive when conducting the required investigation. &nbsp;The Bureau encourages its members to take proactive steps and contact available employee assistance resources following such an event if needed.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;The Bureau also understands the impact that these traumatic incidents has on the families and communities of those persons upon whom deadly force is used and acknowledges the need to be sensitive when conducting the required investigation. &nbsp;All interviews and conversations with family or community members will be conducted in a manner that strives to be respectful while balancing the need to obtain critical information.</p>
<p>Procedure:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Pursuant to ORS &sect;146.095 (1), the District Attorney (DA) shall be responsible for the criminal investigation of all deaths following member use of deadly force.&nbsp; The Bureau shall be responsible for the administrative review of these incidents to determine compliance with Bureau policies, training, and procedures.&nbsp; Over the course of the administrative review, the Bureau shall ensure that compelled information gathered or any information derived from the&nbsp;<em>Garrity</em>-protected interviews is not shared with the DA, Homicide investigators, or any other person performing the criminal investigation of the involved member.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Policy: </strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">1. The Portland Police Bureau is committed to upholding the civil rights of all individuals, protecting human life and property, and maintaining civil order.&nbsp; The Bureau&rsquo;s commitment to public safety includes ensuring the welfare of members of the public, its officers and professional staff, with an emphasis on the sanctity of life and policing with respect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">2. The Portland Police Bureau recognizes that this commitment may require members to use force.&nbsp; The community expects and the Portland Police Bureau requires that members use only the objectively reasonable force necessary to perform their duties and overcome the threat or resistance of the subject under the totality of the circumstances.&nbsp; Members who violate these values by using objectively unreasonable force erode the confidence of the community and may expose themselves, those present, and the greater population to unnecessary danger; thus, objectively unreasonable uses of force shall result in corrective action and/or discipline, up to and including termination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">3. While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to protect the public, nothing in this policy requires a member to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before applying reasonable force.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">4. Over the course of their careers, the Bureau expects members to develop and use skills and abilities that allow them to regularly resolve confrontations while minimizing the need to use force.&nbsp; Members are to be aware that this Directive is more restrictive than state or federal laws.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">5. The Bureau is dedicated to providing training in all categories of force and de-escalation techniques, as well as providing sufficient resources, to help members safely and effectively resolve confrontations through the application of de-escalation tools and lower levels of force.&nbsp; When feasible, members are expected to use de-escalation tactics in order to avoid the need for or reduce the amount of force.&nbsp; However, the Bureau recognizes that each situation is unique and presents its own challenges. &nbsp;Members are expected to adapt and apply Bureau training principles reasonably in unanticipated situations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">6. Members shall attempt to avoid or minimize the use of force against individuals in perceived behavioral or mental health crisis or those with mental illness and direct such individuals to the appropriate services, where possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">7. Member accountability is integral to building and maintaining community trust.&nbsp; The Bureau is committed to institutionalizing systems of accountability and establishing transparent reporting practices.&nbsp; When force is used, the Bureau is dedicated to reviewing, reporting and investigating member actions to determine if the force used was in accordance with Bureau training and policy. &nbsp;This policy establishes reporting and investigative guidelines for all use of force.&nbsp; It includes the specific reporting requirements for all force incidents and the completion of police reports and After Action reports, as defined in this Directive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">8. The Bureau recognizes that the use of force may have an emotional impact on all involved.&nbsp; Members are encouraged to take proactive steps to mitigate these impacts through positive interactions with subjects and concerned community members following such an event.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Procedure</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>1. De-escalation:</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.1. Members shall use de-escalation techniques, when time and circumstances reasonably permit. De-escalation techniques provide members the opportunity to stabilize the scene or reduce the necessity for or intensity of force so that more time, options and resources are available to resolve the confrontation. &nbsp;Members shall take proactive steps to eliminate the immediacy of the threat, establish control and minimize the need for force.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.1. De-escalation techniques include, but are not limited to: 1) using verbal techniques to calm an agitated subject and promote rational decision making; 2) allowing the subject appropriate time to respond to direction; &nbsp;3) communicating with the subject from a safe position using verbal persuasion, advisements, or warnings; 4) decreasing exposure to a potential threat by using distance, cover, or concealment; 5) placing barriers between an uncooperative subject and an officer; 6) ensuring there are an appropriate number of members on scene; 7) containing a threat; 8) moving to a safer position; and 9) avoiding physical confrontation, unless immediately necessary.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.2. When practical and appropriate, members shall consult with and/or call specialized units to respond, including but not limited to those related to behavioral health, tactics and/or negotiation, to assist in de-escalating the situation or devising a disengagement strategy or otherwise assist in safely resolving the incident.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.1.3. To avoid confusion, members shall establish and maintain one-on-one communication with the subject and avoid giving simultaneous directions or having multiple members verbally engaging the subject.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.2. Members shall consider whether a subject&rsquo;s lack of compliance is a deliberate attempt to resist or an inability to comply based on factors including, but not limited to: 1) medical conditions; 2) mental impairment; 3) developmental disability; 4) physical limitation; 5) language barrier; 6) drug or alcohol impairment; and 7) mental health crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.3. Members shall consider a disengagement plan when the benefits to be gained by police intervention are clearly outweighed by the risks associated with the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.4. When responding to and managing scenes involving persons in mental health crisis and when time and circumstances permit, members shall consider using disengagement and de-escalation techniques, as well as devising a response plan through the ROADMAP tool.&nbsp; Members shall refer to Directive 850.20, Police Response to Mental Health Crisis, for additional guidance regarding ROADMAP and encounters with individuals with known or perceived mental illnesses or experiencing mental health crisis.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">1.4.1. Tactics in ROADMAP can be used as a stand-alone tactic, or they may be overlapped with other tactics to create a plan. &nbsp;Plans may need to be altered several times during an incident as it evolves, and members should be prepared to switch to other tactics as the totality of the circumstances changes.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">1.4.1.1. When safe under the totality of circumstances, members shall consider disengagement as a tactic to reduce undue safety risks to the member, the involved person(s) or others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.5. When force is used, the amount of force used, including the number of members who use force, shall be reduced as resistance decreases. &nbsp;Only the amount of force reasonably calculated to maintain control shall be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">1.6. Members shall refrain from using force against individuals who are already under control by officers or who express verbal discontent with officers, but do not otherwise pose a threat to officers or others, or impede a valid law enforcement function.&nbsp; Members must balance the governmental interest to take action in service of the public against the rights of individuals involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Authorized Use of Force.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">2.1. Members are authorized to use force when permitted by this policy in order to:</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">2.1.5. Accomplish some official purpose or duty that is authorized by law or judicial decree.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Warning Issuance.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.1. Unless it would present a danger to the member(s) or others, members shall issue a clear and intelligible verbal warning or attempt to utilize hand signals where there is a language barrier or the subject is deaf or hard of hearing, prior to using any force.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">3.1.1. Members shall provide a description of the warning given in their use of force reports.&nbsp; If no warning was given, members shall provide a justification for the lack of warning.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">3.1.1.1. No written justification is necessary for the lack of a warning for the following:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">3.1.1.1.1. Vehicle intervention techniques; and</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">3.1.1.1.2. Category IV force.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">3.2. Prior to using a less lethal weapon, members shall, when feasible, warn or announce to other members their intent to use the tool, in an attempt to avoid sympathetic fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Prohibited Use of Force.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.1. Members shall not use force against people who engage in passive resistance that does not impede a lawful objective.&nbsp; Physically moving a subject engaged in passive resistance is permitted when it is necessary and objectively reasonable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.2. Members are prohibited from using force for interrogation or torture.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">4.3. Under no circumstances will a member use force solely because another member is using force.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong><em>5. Graham</em></strong><strong> Standard: Force Performance Requirements.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.1. To comply with this Directive and satisfy the constitutional standard, members shall only use force that is objectively reasonable under the totality of circumstances.&nbsp; When determining to use any force, members must balance the individual&rsquo;s Fourth Amendment rights against the government&rsquo;s interest. &nbsp;Members shall at least consider the following three criteria in making a decision to use force:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.1.&nbsp;<strong>Threat</strong>.&nbsp; Whether the individual poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others.&nbsp; The extent and immediacy&nbsp;of the threat are the most important determining factors when considering the need for and type of force that may be reasonable during an encounter.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severity</strong>.&nbsp; The severity of the crime at issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.1.3.&nbsp;<strong>Active Resistance or Evading</strong>.&nbsp; Whether the individual is actively resisting control or attempting to evade.&nbsp; When force is used, the amount of force used, shall be reduced as resistance decreases. &nbsp;Only the amount of force reasonably calculated to maintain control shall be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.2. Though the above three factors are of primary consideration, a reasonableness inquiry is not limited to these factors and force will be evaluated under the totality of the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.3.&nbsp;<strong>Member Considerations for Use of Force. </strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.1. Members should recognize that their approach to confrontations may influence whether force becomes necessary and the amount force that must be used.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.2. Members must not precipitate a use of force by placing themselves or others in jeopardy through actions that are inconsistent with the Bureau&rsquo;s training without a substantial justification for variation from recommended practices.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.3.3. When feasible, members shall allow individuals time to submit to arrest before force is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">5.4.&nbsp;<strong>Other Member Responsibilities.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.4.1. Members must individually justify each independent application of force.&nbsp; When feasible, members shall re-evaluate the need for continued force in between independent uses of force.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.4.2. Members have a duty to reasonably intercede to prevent the use of unlawful force by another member.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.4.3. Members shall take into account all available information, including observed behavior, reports from other members or witnesses, known mental health history and perceived mental illness or mental health crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.4.4. During a confrontation with an individual known or perceived to be in mental health crisis, members must recognize and reasonably balance the governmental interest in providing care to the individual with the need for force. &nbsp;Members shall call in specialized units when practical.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">5.4.5. Members shall refer to Directive 850.20, Police Response to Mental Health Crisis, for intervention techniques regarding individuals with known or perceived mental illnesses or experiencing a mental health crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Less Lethal Force.</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.1. Less lethal force provides members with additional tactics or options for managing encounters with threatening or actively resistive subjects.&nbsp; However, members shall consider that the use of less lethal force can still result in death or serious injury.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">6.2. Members shall not use less lethal weapons on the following persons unless the person is armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon, or is about to commit suicide, or is in the act of causing harm to themselves or others, or the member has probable cause that the subject has committed a Measure 11 crime:<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.2.1. Children who are known to be, or are obviously under the age of fifteen.<strong></strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">6.2.2. An individual who is known to be, or is obviously pregnant.<strong></strong></p>

<p style=""padding-left: 90px;"">6.4.1.2. Restricted Uses.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">6.4.1.2.1. Members striking or jabbing with a baton shall not deliberately target the head or throat, neck, spine, or groin unless deadly force would be authorized.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 150px;"">6.4.1.2.1.1. Unintentional or inadvertent strikes to these restricted areas require following all other reporting procedures, with the addition of explicitly verbally notifying a supervisor that this has occurred.&nbsp; Reports must specifically address the circumstances and actions that related to striking restricted areas.</p>

<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">6.4.2.1.4. To effect the capture or prevent the escape of a subject when the member reasonably believes that the subject presents an immediate risk of physical injury to the public, members or themselves, or the escape of the subject presents a significant danger to the public, members or themselves.&nbsp; Mere flight from an officer is not sufficient cause for the use of the impact munitions.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">6.4.2.1.5. Members shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that impact munitions are used on preferred target areas. &nbsp;Under seven yards, members will aim for the legs. &nbsp;Over seven yards, members will aim anywhere below the waist line except the groin.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">6.4.2.1.6. Members may use impact munitions on vicious or aggressive animals when the presence of those animals interferes with the safety of the members or the public, the execution of a police function, or completion of a mission.</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.3;"">Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot Program: A short-term, preliminary trial to help an organization learn how a project might work in practice.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Portland Police Bureau is committed to providing its members with proper field equipment. Research and development of any item to be deployed for field evaluation will be conducted through pilot programs, to ensure comprehensive vetting from concept to implementation. Potential pilot program items generally include anything a member may wear or use in the field (e.g. ballistic vest, firearms, flashlights, etc.), but excludes communications infrastructure and fleet.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. Members may not keep, wear, carry or utilize pilot program items outside the scope of the trial, unless authorized in writing to do so by the Chief of Police or designee. Members may only wear, carry or utilize field equipment that is systematically acquired, issued, and/or approved by the Police Bureau, for official Bureau purposes, in accordance with Bureau policy and training.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Intake and/or Assignment:</li>
</ol>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any Police Bureau member may request a pilot program be conducted by routing a written memorandum and supporting documentation, through the chain of command, to the Assistant Chief of Services.</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Assistant Chief of Services will review pilot program requests together with the Training Division Manager, the Fiscal Services Division Manager, and the Information Technology Division Manager. The Assistant Chief of Services may assign the pilot program to one (1) of these three (3) Responsibility Unit Managers, who will then be responsible for implementing the pilot program based on the parameters discussed.</p>
<p>2. Evaluation and/or Implementation:</p>
<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Responsibility Unit Manager assigned to the pilot program will provide the Assistant Chief of Services with a written overview of the pilot program and a recommendation for next steps.</p>
<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Assistant Chief of Services will review the pilot program overview and recommendation together with the Training Division Manager, the Fiscal Services Division Manager, and the Information Technology Division Manager.</p>
<p>2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the pilot program is determined feasible, the Assistant Chief of Services will further coordinate implementation (e.g. procurement, policy, training, inspections, etc.), after consultation with the Chief of Police. The Assistant Chief of Services will inform impacted union representatives of the Police Bureau&rsquo;s implementation plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the pilot program is determined impractical, the Responsibility Unit Manager will terminate the trial and retract and dispose of any items tested in accordance with established city procedure.</p>
<p>3. Records regarding pilot programs will be maintained in accordance with 8013-07, Special Project Records.</p>

<li>Evidentiary Information: Any written correspondence, photo, recording or other information taken, created or documented in the ordinary course of police business that either is evidence of a crime, or that is reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of further evidence of a crime, whether that information pertains to either the possible guilt or innocence of a subject. Such information should be preserved both for investigation reasons and reasons related to the resolution of any charges in the criminal justice system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This policy provides guidance to Bureau members about the issuance process for Bureau-issued smart phones, the appropriate uses of Bureau-issued smart phones, and technology prohibitions and considerations related to smart phone use.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Bureau recognizes the technological capabilities of smart phones to document and gather information; however, smart phones shall not be treated or used as body worn cameras.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Any member assigned a smart phone shall carry or have available that device while on duty or off duty but in paid on call status, in a manner in which it is accessible. The RU manager may grant temporary exceptions to this for specific missions or assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuance and Replacement of Smart Phones.</p>
<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of the work units and positions authorized to receive smart phones is located on the Intranet. Any variance from the established list requires written or email approval from the Assistant Chief of Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will contact their designated unit phone coordinator for new and replacement phone requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Designated phone coordinators from each unit will review and manage each member&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>1.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone coordinator will submit requests to the Management Services Division (MSD) Communications Coordinator, or designee, who is the approving authority for all phone requests.</p>
<p>1.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phone coordinators will process replacement requests in the same manner as the issuance of new phones.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MSD Communications Coordinator will track the replacement cycle of assigned phones and notify the RU phone coordinators when members can receive a replacement.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will be issued iPhones, with the exception of callout units. Callout unit members have the option of using either iPhones or Android phones. (Android phones provide prolonged notification until the user confirms receipt).</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are reminded that Bureau-issued phones are City property; therefore, members shall utilize a phone case that is designed to protect the phone. Members may use the phone case that is issued with the phone or they may purchase a personal phone case at their own expense.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Callout unit members authorized to use Android phones include: Critical Incident Commanders, Crisis Negotiation Team, Explosive Disposal Units, and Special Emergency Reaction Team.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members assigned to callout units who choose to swap from an iPhone to an Android will work with their phone coordinator who will then arrange the transfer of data to the new phone.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members receiving a smart phone will retain the initial phone number assigned, regardless of the type of phone issued.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who have phones that are eligible for an upgrade or have phones that are unable to meet operational needs will contact their phone coordinator.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">1.9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members who retire or separate from the Bureau may request authorization from the Bureau&rsquo;s Information Technology Division (ITD) to port the phone number assigned to their Bureau smart phone to their own personal phone account.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reporting Lost or Stolen Phones.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will immediately notify their phone coordinator during business hours or the Bureau of Technology Services (BTS) Helpdesk at 503-823-5199, prompt 3, after-hours.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will work with ITD to identify the current location.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reporting a lost or stolen phone, members must communicate what kind of information was stored or handled on the phone, and specify if it contained confidential or sensitive data (e.g., Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) information, crime scene photos, etc.).</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will notify their RU manager of the loss or theft as soon as practical but no later than 24 hours after discovering the loss.</p>
<p class=""WordSection2"">2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will write a General Offense (GO) report to document the theft of a Bureau-issued phone.</p>
<p>2.5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will send a memo to their branch Assistant Chief, through channels, explaining the circumstances under which the phone went missing.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">2.6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will coordinate with their phone coordinator to receive a new phone.</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members will return their smart phones to MSD upon separation before or on their last day of employment at the Bureau or on their first day of a new assignment that does not warrant a smart phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""WordSection3"">4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of Internet-Based Social Media Applications (Apps) and Websites.</p>
<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may access social media sites currently allowed on Mobile Data Computers (MDCs) and desktops; however, members should refrain from accessing personal social media accounts on Bureau equipment.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Members should contact ITD if they are unsure whether accessing a certain website is allowed. Unless necessary for a specific duty related function, members will not enter suspicious or questionable websites.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apps, Settings, and Software Compliance and Prohibitions.</p>
<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Smart Phone Settings.</p>
<p>5.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are prohibited from factory resetting or modifying a Bureau-issued phone&rsquo;s operating system. Members shall refer to Directive 317.40, Authorized Use of Bureau Resources, for additional guidelines.</p>
<p>5.1.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the phone is reset or modified, ITD will notify the respective division manager of the incident and immediately lock and wipe the member&rsquo;s phone if it is altered.</p>
<p>5.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are prohibited from disabling their smart phone&rsquo;s location services (i.e., GPS), as this allows ITD to locate a member&rsquo;s phone in the event that it is lost or stolen. The Mobile Device Management program that ITD utilizes continually updates the last known GPS location of a member&rsquo;s smart phone; however, the GPS location services function does not keep or create record of these GPS updates. The GPS location services function does not permanently store or actively track a member&rsquo;s smart phone GPS coordinates, nor does it create or provide GPS historical data sets.&nbsp; This function shall remain inactive unless one of the circumstances under 5.1.2.1 through 5.1.2.3 occurs.</p>
<p>5.1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a member&rsquo;s notification to ITD of a lost or stolen phone, ITD will pull the last known location reported to the Mobile Device Manager in an attempt to obtain the current location in an effort to recover the member&rsquo;s lost or stolen smart phone.</p>
<p>5.1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chief of Police, or a designee, may authorize ITD to pull the last known location of an individual member&rsquo;s smart phone in a situation that the Chief of Police reasonably believes that a member is or may be in imminent danger of serious injury or death.</p>
<p>5.1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a criminal investigation, the investigating authority would be required to follow all applicable laws and rules regarding the seizure of records pertaining to a member&rsquo;s smart phone historical data.&nbsp;This data is not stored by ITD and is not accessible by members of ITD. In such an investigation, a court order will be obtained that authorizes the activation and monitoring of the GPS location services of a member&rsquo;s assigned smart phone. This court order would be required to be served to the service provider of the cellular phone and would be limited by the capabilities of the service provider.</p>
<div class=""WordSection4"">
<p>5.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are prohibited from using iCloud or similar cloud-based storage because it renders the Bureau out of compliance with CJIS. ITD may provide an alternative CJIS compliant option for file sharing upon appropriate request, based on work necessity.</p>
<p>5.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members are prohibited from forwarding information related to Criminal Justice Information (CJI) (e.g., calls, texts, images, recordings) to a personal phone. Members who do forward information violate Criminal Justice Information System (CJIS) regulations.</p>
<p>5.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure communications are enabled on a member&rsquo;s phone through the Virtual Private Network (VPN) or &ldquo;mobility&rdquo; function. While the default setting is set to &ldquo;on,&rdquo; this feature may become disabled when the phone is powered off. Members must ensure mobility remains turned on each time they power their phone. Members will not intentionally turn off the mobility function. Members can search the Intranet for instructions on how to turn Mobility on by searching key words: smart phone or Mobility.</p>
