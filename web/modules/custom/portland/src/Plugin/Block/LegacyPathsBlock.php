 *   - This file, src/Plugin/Block/LegacyPathsBlock.php
 *   - templates/block--portland-legacy-paths-block.html.twig
 *   - In portland.module > portland_theme, remove the portland_legacy_paths_block element
 *   - In group type config, remove field_disable_legacy_paths_block from all grop types
 *   - Remove Portland Legacy Paths Block from block layout
 *
 * @Block(
 *   id = "portland_legacy_paths_block",
 *   admin_label = @Translation("Portland Legacy Paths Block"),
